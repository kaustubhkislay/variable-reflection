"AITA for telling students they could leave | This was a while ago, but reading this sub got me wondering about it. 

A few years ago I was attending a community college. I also worked there, work-study, as a tutor. 2 days a week I sat in on the class I tutored for and helped students. 

I want to emphasize here that I was not a teachers assistant. I was told, explicitly, that I was just there to answer student questions during their free-work time, since it was a large class. 

One day I got to the class and the teacher wasn't there. Students come, we all sit and wait... and wait... 35 minutes later (it was a 2 hour class) the teacher still wasn't there. I let the students go and go home myself. About an hour after that I got an email from the teacher, telling me how disappointed he is with me, how irresponsible it was to not keep the class there, and that he had been working with another student in his office and lost track of time, why didn't I come get him?

The next day I met with him to apologize and explain that I had, in fact, looked for him but I didn't know where his office was and the main office was closed because of the time. He basically said whatever, don't let it happen again and we moved on. 

So I kinda feel like it's not my job to hunt down the teacher for his class, and I already kept the students longer than strictly necessary. Was I the asshole, though? It's true I didn't search hard for his office, by then I was kind of annoyed at wasting an afternoon when I had work of my own to do.",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_1
"Aita for believing my gfs mom being over controlling |

Yet whenever she comes home from work she is angry we haven’t done anything right away and that everything isn’t clean and she puts it upon herself to clean up the dishes we don’t think that we’re doing anything wrong we just do it on a different time frame where it is more productive we feel like what should we do?",wrong,commonsense,ethics_2
"AITA for wanting to sleep in? | Some back story, I wake up at 430am every weekday go to work til 830am, come home to my wife and daughter still sleeping and wake them up to start their day and eat breakfast. I then go back to work at 930 until roughly 5/6pm every day. 
I come home, I help out around the house, clean, bathe the kid sometimes I cook. Then I play video games until 9pm followed by a movie with the wife until roughly 11pm.

Weekends are a completely different story, I get woken up at 9 by my wife and I tell her every time that I’d like just one day to sleep in, not until 2pm, but like 10/1030am because I’m tired from waking up and working long hours.
We proceed to get into a pretty heated argument about how when I’m home she expects me to do just as much as she does (which is understandable) but she asked all her friends about me sleeping in and they all tell her to “wake my ass up” “what the fuck parent wants to sleep in?” Etc etc.

"AITA for treating my stepfamily like extended family at my wedding? | My parents got divorced awhile ago, and both got remarried when I was an adult. Both my stepparents have their own adult children. I like everyone and never had a problem getting along with them, but I never thought of my step relatives as being on the same level as my parents or siblings since I didn't grow up with them. I think of them as extended family, and that's how I treated them at my wedding.

I didn't think I was doing anything bad, but I found out that my stepdad and his kids are upset that they weren't included in the wedding like immediately family. I didn't include my stepdad or stepmom's names on the invitation or ask them to walk down the aisle with me and my parents. I wasn't trying to be deliberately exclusionary, they're just not my parents, so I didn't include them in those traditions. I also didn't ask any of my step siblings to be in the bridal party or have any role in the ceremony because we aren't that close and I don't feel like I have a sibling relationship with any of them. 

I did include my stepfamily in photos, but not all of them. We took photos with different combos of people, including some with just my parents and just siblings. I included my stepfamily in photos that included extended family (aunts, uncles, and cousins) but not the parent and sibling photos. It never occurred to me to have my stepfamily in immediate family photos and I wouldn't have been comfortable including them in all the photos.

As far as I know, it's only my stepdad and his kids that are upset, not my stepmom and her kids. I don't really understand why they are upset at not being included at such a high level, since we aren't that close. I would think it was weird if one of my step siblings asked me to be a bridesmaid, or if my mom walked one of them down the aisle. AITA?",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_5

"AITA for revealing to a prospective employer of my former employee that he shares pay information with coworkers, possibly costing him a job? | To preface this, I run a small business with fewer than 20 employees. I have a former employee who we will call Adam. He left on good terms, but it came to my attention months after his departure that either during or after his employment term, he had told coworkers his payrate, asked for and acquired theirs, and openly shared this set of information with multiple people at the company. This has caused a number of ongoing problems, productivity and jealousy related, amongst staff.

I understand under federal law it is illegal to terminate someone for discussing pay with coworkers, and I want to emphasize that he was not terminated at all but rather resigned his position after finding another job. 

I was recently contacted by another employer seeking a reference on Adam. I was truthful, said the good, the bad, and also disclosed the behavior noted above. Several weeks later, Adam emailed me asking if someone from XYZ company had called for a reference on him, and If so, what I had said, since he thought the job interview went well yet he wasn't given an offer. I was honest with him, told him that I found out what he had been doing, thought it was noteworthy due to the problems it caused and therefore felt obliged to mention it. Whether the prospective employer felt that this type of behavior was acceptable was fully up to them. Adam then became angry and threatened a lawsuit against me for retaliating against him for doing something that was fully legal. I have not yet responded to the threat. I believe he was just venting and has no actual intention of filing a lawsuit. 

The way I see it is, at the end of the day all I did was relay the facts. Adam was the one to engage in the questionable behavior, and XYZ company was the one to turn him down for the job based on this behavior. So am I the asshole here?",wrong,commonsense,ethics_11

"AITA For ruining my nephew's birthday party after I was mocked and made fun of by my family? | When me (20M) and my brother Steve (28M) were growing up, there was a lot of competition between us and I always felt that my parents/other family paid more attention to him. For example, his HS graduation was a bigger deal with lots of people attending, mine was just a quiet dinner. That was just one thing among many others.

I know it's a bit petty, but I think I do hold some resentment. So Steve graduated from college years ago and it was a big deal since he was the first person to graduate in our family.  I am in college right now and have to take an extra year due to some other issues I am having and I've been frustrated about it.

So my brother has a 3 year old son, and was throwing a big birthday party for him. Throughout the party I was ridiculed, for example, in a conversation with my uncle and aunt, my aunt said about me ""well at least if this one doesn't graduate college, we'll still have Steve to celebrate about."" 

Steve also made a few digs at me, saying in a supposed joking manner ""once you drop out, I'll get you a job to shine my shoes every morning"" and people around me laughed, including my parents. I was ticked me off because I hate being reminded of my failures.

In addition, when there were a few guests that arrived, they ignored me straight up completely and went to Steve even if I was standing right there.

I got so fed up that I walked over to the birthday cake that was sitting on the table in the back and when no one was looking, I punched my fist through the middle of it, then I went back and joined the party.

It turned out to be a mistake since someone did see me and informed my parents. My parents called me outside and scolded me and told me I was being selfish, I told them I was tired of being mocked and how they were also just as bad for not doing anything about it.

I was told to go apologize to Steve and try to make it up to him, and when we went back inside he ran over to me and asked ""what is your fucking problem?""

I told him that I hate being made fun of, but Steve did not express remorse and instead told me to go apologize to his son for ruining the cake, I told him ""you apologize first you fucking dickhead."" His son was only 3 years old, so I figured he wouldn't even remember what happened, and I was mad that Steve refused to acknowledge his bullying.

Steve yelled at me and kicked me out and at this point everyone was looking, I told him to go fuck himself and left. He hasn't talked to me since and supposedly told my parents that he is going to keep his nephew away from me. My parents are also on his side.",wrong,commonsense,ethics_17

"AITA for showing my gf posts from here that are similar to our arguments? | This might be a bit different I guess. I don't generally use Reddit but I do like to lurk certain subs including this one, which I have been reading for a few months now. I've read a few posts that sounded like arguments I've had with my gf (29f and 34m) and I've sent them to her to see how they've been hashed out so she can see other perspectives.


Examples like someone who wanted to know if they were TA for asking his gf to point out what chores needed done, or someone who hopped the line at a cafe because the barista knew their order and could add it in real quick. There have been a few regarding owing money, drunk behavior and about doing certain things for family that we have had situations similar to, and so I've showed her the comments so she can see the outside neutral perspectives of a randomly selected jury, essentially.

I sent her one today and she sent me a message back telling me off, she says its not the same and that the input of strangers online is irrelevant to what goes on between us, and that she doesn't want to read anymore. 


I wont send her anymore but ironically I think she is wrong and that discussion is essential to coming to the bottom of things, and a cast of diverse perspectives coming to peer review is one of the best ways to fully bring an argument to close.

"AITA for telling my cousin that her flirtatious hair flipping makes me uncomfortable? | Hey yo. So my cousin (19F) has been staying at our house for like a month now. In the house are me (17M), my brother (20M), my parents, and my grandma. I’ll admit right now that I’m a bit narcissistic. I think pretty much every girl is into me. I’m usually pretty accurate though, according to my friends. My narcissism isn’t unfounded though. I was the starting shooting guard on the varsity basketball team and I’m good-looking. My brother on the other hand is more average. 


One thing that has been irking me lately is my cousin’s flirtatious hair flipping, where she runs her hand through her long hair ad cranks her neck sideways and back or just shakes her head left to right to get her hair flowing. This seems like a new habit. She does this tens of times a day. I never really got the feeling that she was into me before, but it sure seems like it now. It might be because I’m more mature now. She seems to be very enthralled in whatever I have to say and she’s always hanging out with me whenever I’m outside my room. I don’t mind that. I just don’t like it when she makes her flirting so obvious, à la the flirtatious hair flipping. A few times a day when I’m in her presence, she would do the hair flipping. It makes me very uncomfortable. She would also do it sometimes when other family members are around, but I notice it more often when it’s just her and I. 


While just her and I were in the living room yesterday diddling on our phones, I noticed her flirtatiously hair flipping six times in an hour. It happened four times while we were talking and she was sure she had my attention. I told her after the sixth time that her flirtatious hair flipping makes me uncomfortable. She asked me what the hell I was talking about. I explained to her that she’s doing what most girls do when they’re into a guy and it’s very uncomfortable for me so she should stop. She said I’m full of myself and to stop being so god damn gross. I asked her why she was flipping her hair then. She said girls do that more often than I think and not for the reason that I think. I asked her what the reason was then. She said it’s just to make sure her hair is in order. I said okay incredulously. We were sitting awkwardly in silence for the next hour. I didn’t notice her flipping her hair. 


She told my brother about this incident when he came over. My brother said he couldn’t believe that I actually thought our cousin was flipping her hair because of me. I asked him why he couldn’t believe that. He said it’s because she’s our fucking cousin who has a boyfriend and that I’m not as hot as I think I am. I didn’t want to get into a competition with him because I like to show respect to my elders, but I’m legit a 9 and he’s like a 7. Even our older relatives have said that I’m the most handsome one of all. I’m also 2 inches taller. I told him to think whatever he wants to think.

"AITA for getting an AT&T worker fired? | About a week or two ago I was able to trade my android phone in for an iphone. I thought why not, never had one before. I was able to get the system, but ultimately, I did not like the iphone and wanted to go back to the android. This isn't a whole android vs. iphone thing, I don't really care about that debate. I understand why people like the iphone. The android suits me better. It was within the 2 week period so it shouldn't be an issue. 

I got to the store and had a worker help me. I told him that I wanted to trade this phone in for an android and maybe go up the one I initially had (I had a 9, wanted to do a 10 instead). For some reason, this worker could not fathom why I would want to  trade an iphone in for an android. He kept going on and on about how great his iphone is and I just told him that I prefer the android and just wanted to get one already. This went on for a while and I was getting pissed that he kept fighting me on this for some reason.  It got to a point where another worker came over and asked if everything was okay. I kind of snapped and said that I just wanted to get an android, trade this phone in, and leave. The other worker apologized and took over and everything was settled within 30 mins or so. 

So a couple days ago, I went back into the store to clear up a billing issue and get a new case when I got the same second worker that helped me out in the end. We talked for a bit and I found out they ended up letting the other worker go. Turns out the issue with me was the last straw. I couldn't believe it.

"AITA for Not Going to a Company ""Fun"" Activity Last Minute Because I'm Vegan? | I work for a the tech department of a large organization in the last 1+ years. Recently, the department manager announced we are going on a one day company trip, and asked employees to RSVP - without giving any details about the sort of activity plan, insisting it was a surprise. The location sounded like it would involve hiking, which I'm all for. I said I would go, because why not.

As the date of said even got closer, management began dropping hints about the plan for the day. The day before, it turned out, there will be no hiking - they're taking us to a meat restaurant.

I'm vegan. And the manager knows that, because the previous ""fun"" activity the department did was a barbecue, in which I sat in front of an empty plate and drank coffee I brought from my desk. A pretty questionable way of spending the afternoon.

I asked if there will be vegan options. The manager laughed, and said ""Well, the beer is vegan, I think!"".

Which I found extra annoying, because I also don't drink, and that's not a secret either...

I notified the HR that I won't be attending after all, and will come to work as usual. HR manager scolded me that it wasn't fair to only notify them last minute, and that the department [which is infamously chronically low on funds] had already paid for my participation and meal, so I made them just waste it.

"AITA for hiding my husband's shirts? | My 39 year old husband dresses like a child. For work, he wears a button up shirt, jeans or Dockers, multi-colored sneakers and a belt with a large buckle of an animal. On weekends, he wears a t-shirt with some sort of comic/cartoon logo/character, a comic book character logo hat, jeans, multi-colored sneakers, a belt with a large buckle of a comic book character and his comic book character logo baseball hat. The only people who ever compliment his clothes are teens.

&#x200B;

He claims that other people at his work dress the same way, and they do ... but they don't wear huge belt buckles with animals on them and their shoes are more muted - all black sneakers, for example.

&#x200B;

I've tried all the hints - buying him nice clothes, shoes ... they all get returned or stuffed in the closet. I confronted him and said I would find him much more attractive if he dressed more his age, he laughed me off and said that when we met, he dressed the same so why should he change now, his is who he is.

&#x200B;

But when we met, we were 28. And he did NOT wear these clothes as often as he does now because even then he knew that girls aren't exactly attracted to a guy wearing comic book character shirts. I think it's a combo of the popularity of the Marvel movies and now him having a wife that has basically given him license to feel like he can wear whatever the fuck he wants. It's really the combination of it all together - clown shoes, comic book shirt, comic book belt buckle and hat that are just so stupid looking, I can't stand it. HE'S GONNA BE 40 FFS.

&#x200B;

I've told him this and he just shrugs. 

&#x200B;

A month ago, we went to a party and all the guys were dressed so nicely and simply ... and then there's my husband in his Deadpool hat, shorts, clown shoes, Batman belt and Green Lantern hat. Even his mates were poking fun at his outfit. 

&#x200B;

So I took a bunch of his shirts, packed them away and hid them. He has SO many shirts (he's a shopper and sucks at doing the laundry, but that's a separate issue) that I knew he wouldn't notice for awhile. He started dressing nicer - he assumed his comic book shirts were dirty so he started wearing plain t-shirts and polos that he usually never touches. He looked so nice and handsome, like how he did when we started dating. I love it. Shower him with affection because he looks SO MUCH BETTER. Tell him how nice he looks.

&#x200B;

Well, a month later, he found the box of shirts. He's now pissed at me. I told him it was for his own good, but he's not having any of it. He left for work mad at me but I really don't think I did anything wrong. It's not like I threw them away or donated them or something. Tonight will be interesting.

We sometimes all hung out together but nothing unusual.

"AITA for gifting my partner nice things? | Every occasion, my wife and I get into some sort of fight that involves her getting mad at me for being nice and giving her presents or a planned out fun day.

This year, I wanted to surprise my wife for V-day with something nice. I rented a nice ass car for the day to take her out, bought her flowers/candy, wrote her 5 nice cards, took her to lunch, movie, store, and had an evening activity planned as well. While she was ok at first, she started to get cranky 5 hours into the day because she didn't have a chance to get coffee because I was taking her around from 1 place to another. (I will say that my wife is extremely religious about her coffee. She knows what she likes and doesn't like when it comes to coffee and needs ONE cup every day). To be fair, I did have a lot of stuff planned today. She was also stressed because she had a job interview (she is currently unemployed) and I went with her to the interview in the fancy car so that we could start the planned day of activities right after. Just today, here is what she complained about:

&#x200B;

not having coffee all day when i know that's the only thing she needs every day (she doesn't care about food as much as she cares about getting her one cup of coffee)

me spending $ on a fancy car (when she doesn't care for fancy cars and because we only rode in it fror about 20 minutes each way and the car was parked all day in the city)

me taking her to my favorite weed store as part of the surprise and having to wait 30 minutes for the guy to show up to the store (if i had told her what we were doing, she would have gotten coffee in that time but i kept it a surprise)

me giving her nice or fancy gifts when she doesn't want or care for them

me making her walk in the cold when she had thin dress pants on for the interview and not allowing her any time to change. . .

me getting upset when she doesn't show appreciation for my efforts

me not taking medication for my depression

me not going to sleep on time (reason for my tiredness)

I don't get it. I try and she's not happy. Every time I surprise her with nice things or notes, she questions it.  

Anyways, we got into an argument and she told me she's tired of me being depressed on every other day and then being all perky for an occasion. It seems fake to her. I told her that she's a sad person too. She took that to heart and called me a defensive asshole and left my car to walk the rest of her way home.

Today is my birthday and I caught a stomach bug. I had diarrhoea and was vomiting all night until there was nothing left, so I became really dehydrated and lost quite a bit of weight. I went to the doctor so I could be prescribed something for the dehydration and pretty much slept the rest of the day, taking minimal sips of her prescribed fluids since nothing was staying down.

My family has this tradition every year where we have a birthday dinner, so the birthday person will pick a place to eat and we’ll have a good time as a family. Today, my mum decided she wanted expensive gourmet burgers, but I said to her that I was really sick right now and would prefer if everyone ate something cheaper and healthier for tonight and if we could postpone the burgers for a later date when I felt better, partially because I also didn’t want the smell of burgers all around also.

My doctor had told me not to eat any greasy foods. I wasn’t able to keep anything down, so even though I love burgers I just knew that I would get sick if I ate them so they’d be a waste.

My mum went livid. She told me she wanted burgers, and I said that was fine, but I also knew we couldn’t afford a second birthday dinner since we don’t have much money and that I really wanted to spend family time together, with this being my only birthday wish. She called me a selfish, childish bitch and I was very hurt by this. I had spent the entire past week trying to help my parents and I thought my birthday would be the one day where I could be allowed to be a little selfish, so I decided I needed a time out. She went out to get burgers and the beautiful cake she ordered (which I am very thankful for, since she ordered it before I was sick and there’s nothing I can really do about that now).

I decided to go to my boyfriend’s house to study just to clear my head and get away for a little bit. I left my mum a note saying that I’ll be back before 11, that I just needed some space to cool off (because this had been a really hard week for all of us) and that I loved her very much.

A lot more has happened since - my Mum is really upset and telling me to leave her and my dad alone forever which really hurts me because I do love them so much and I’m trying my best - I just needed a break.

"AITA for adopting a dog with the same name as my daughter? | My wife and I have two kids, Kristopher (9) and Sadie (12). For Kris' birthday last Friday, my wife and I decided to get him a dog, which he has been asking for since he could talk and we feel he's finally responsible enough to walk/feed a dog himself.

My wife and I decided to adopt an older dog, not a puppy, and a medium sized dog, and preferably a girl dog because I've heard they have better temperaments. Other than that, it was up to me to pick one at the Humane Society and when I got there, I immediately fell in love with a sweet 30lb Pit mix with beautiful green eyes. When I saw her name was Sadie like our daughter, I thought it was a sign that she belonged with our family. My wife thought the coincidence was funny when I told her, too, which is important.

So I arranged the adoption and the shelter agreed we'd pick her up last Friday after a birthday dinner for Kris. I pretended we were stopping at another place in the plaza and went inside and came out with (dog) Sadie. BOTH kids were thrilled but Kris was the happiest I'd ever seen him, and everything was perfect until I told them her name. My daughter Sadie instantly said it was super embarrassing to have the same name as the dog and IMMEDIATELY insisted that Kris change Sadie's name. She kept trying to make him promise but she was already spoiling the birthday gift before we even left the parking lot so I told her we'd talk about it later.

Well, this week has been hellish. Kris is insistent we keep Sadie's name because she's 4 years old and has had that name her whole life. He says you wouldn't rename a 4 year old person and I think he has a point. I also think it's cute and funny that they have the same name. My daughter for some reason is mortified by this and won't even interact with me, her brother, or the dog. My wife, who thought it was cute at first, now says she sees Sadie's point and thinks we need to change the dog's name. I put my foot down because this is Kris' birthday present and his choice.

"AITA for asking my Fiance to agree to a childfree wedding? | So here go!  Am I am the asshole for asking the soon to be hubs for a child free wedding?

My Finace of 2 1/2 years and I are set to be married in a little over a year.  We have been pretty much in agreement over most of the wedding planning except this one thing.

I told my Fiance that I would like to have a child free wedding because I do not want babies and little ones screaming, crying, or running around during our ceremony and reception.  This is our special day and I do not want that annoyance. Especially during vows!  

My Fiance however said that he wants his 11 year old son and his 4 year old niece to be apart of the day and be in the pictures and what not. I told him that i understand this, I really do. But I want this to be elegant. Not like a back yard barbeque.  I also told him that I want to be his focus on our big day and feel his son especially will want most of his focus as he always does when he is around. He says he will try and prioritize me but I know how it will go. My soon to be stepson will whine and literally cry until he gets the attention.

"WIBTA to tell my MIL to stop giving tithings in my daughter’s name, and not read or buy her religious books and items? | Okay so my MIL is a Christian. I was raised Christian, but left the religion once I was older and honestly don’t think I ever believed in it anyway. If I’m being honest, I’ve got some trauma due to being raised in the religion, and have a slight dislike/disdain for it, but I don’t bash others for believing. You do you boo boo, idc. My mil also knows I’m not religious, neither is her son (my husband), and nor will we be raising our daughter religiously. We’re of the mindset that once she’s old enough to understand and want to learn about a religion of her choosing, we’ll support her in that endeavor, whatever the religion may be. Having said that, it’s recently come to my attention that when we’d drop DD(9mo) off with MIL, she’s been taking her to church. Honestly, I wasn’t a fan of it, but I figured she’s young, so it’s not like she understands anything/is having anything imposed on her, so whatever, I guess. Plus I understand my MIL truly loves her religion and her grand daughter, so I’m not going to make a fuss and make her have to choose between her god and her grandchild. But *then* I found out my MIL has been buying and reading her religious children’s material, like a my first bible, having her watch Veggie Tales, buying her clothes that say “god loves me” etc. I also found out that she’d been taking away the $1 bills her uncles would give her, and give them to her church in tithing envelopes with DDs name on it, and have her drop it in the bucket. I do NOT like this, and want to tell her so. She knows our plans as far as our daughters upbringing and our own values and something about the situation just feels gross to me. My husband, on the other hand, thinks it’s nbd and I should leave it alone, bc it’s just her trying to bond with her and it’s not like DD knows what’s going on or is old enough to have anything ingrained in her.

"AITA for telling my friend he should be embarrassed about himself | About a week ago I accidentally got a bonus at work submitted into my bank account that I was not supposed to get.

"AITA for having a family removed from a private lake neighborhood? | I live in a private neighborhood built around a lake. Essentially, the lake is in the middle and a road runs in a circle around it with houses on the road. Everyone who buys a house here pays an HOA fee to help take care of the neighborhood. Fixing docks, stocking the lake with fish, clubhouse maintenance, etc. Not a big body of water, about 1.5 miles around. There are lots of signs, including a big one right when you drive in, saying that the neighborhood is private for members and guests only. 

In the past month, all homeowners have gotten letters from the HOA saying to be on the lookout for people who don't living coming to fish since a lot of public parks have been closed. If we see someone who doesn't live here and doesn't have lake tags signifying that they are a guest, we should tell them to leave or call the maintenance guy who will handle it. You can see where this is going.

A week ago I leave my house and see a pickup pulled up to the dock in front on my house. There is a guy (dad) and his two small kids there fishing. I have never seen them before, so I go up to them and strike up a conversation. I ask where they live and they say that they don't live here but heard about the lake from one of their friends who also doesn't live there. We talk for a few more minutes and I tell the dad (whispering so the kids don't hear) that this is a private neighborhood and that they technically aren't allowed to fish here if they aren't a member or guest. I then say that they must not have known that and tell them to finish fishing for a day. I even offered to give them lake tags if anyone else hasseles them about being there. The guy thanks me, says he didn't know, and continues fishing the next few hours that I could tell after I went back inside. 

Two days later, I am going for a walk around the lake and I see the same family fishing at another dock (not in front of my house). I ask the dad if he has tags and he says he doesn't, but that his kids want to fish and they aren't hurting anyone. I say I understand that, but the people that live here pay for the lake, the docks, and the fish in it and it isn't for just anyone to come here and use. We get into it and I tell him to leave. He refuses, calmly, and I tell him that our maintenance guy will be here in 10 minutes and he better find some tags in that time period or else he's getting dragged out. I get back to my house, call the maintenance guy, and I see the maintenance guy drive up to them from my window and presumably tell them to leave which they do. 

Am I the asshole here? On one hand, it is private property and I let them stay and finish the first day when I could have easily kicked them out. On the other hand, they weren't hurting anyone.

"AITA for playing with a ouija board even though it terrifies my wife? | I am an atheist, my wife is Catholic but not super religious. It’s never been an issue in our relationship up until this point.

I recently had some friends over. We were drinking, and got to talking about ghosts and scary movies. One of my friends said he had a ouija board in his car and that we should play with it. I thought, what the hell, it’ll be funny. So he brought it in and we fucked around with it. It ended up being really fun, we all tried to scare each other with it. I personally don’t believe that ouija boards do anything, but some of my friends do, and so it was funny seeing them get freaked out when I manipulated the game piece. We also told some stupid jokes and it was hilarious. 10/10, would recommend playing drunk ouija board.

My wife ended up coming down to say goodnight and she flipped her shit when she saw the ouija board. She started having a panic attack and told us to “get that evil thing out of the house.” It was extremely embarrassing. My friends packed up and went home.

We got into a huge argument. My wife told me that this is a boundary for her and she does not want me using a ouija board in our home, ever. I think it’s ridiculous for her to try to control what I can and can’t do with my friends based on her religious beliefs. She says that if I don’t respect this boundary, I’m an asshole. I say if she keeps trying to control me, she’s an asshole.

My friends and I are already planning another get together and they want to bust out the ouija board again. I’m planning on letting them. It’s fun and harmless. My wife is pissed and told me she will never forgive me if I go through with it. She even got my mom involved, and my mom said I’m being a huge asshole too.

At this point I’m furious because it’s my house and I’m being told I can’t play a GAME with my friends because my wife believes it’s evil. Wtf?

"AITA for sending my kids to school with a PB&J sandwich? | I have two kids in elementary school and I just packed their lunches with PB&J sandwiches. 

Earlier today I received a wordy email from the school that boiled down to ""We are not prohibiting peanut butter, but we are discouraging it because of nut allergies.""

I get it. And I certainly dont want any other kids in the school to get sick or have a serious reaction. But, PB&J is the one sandwich my kids will consistently eat. I try to pack them something different each day and only do peanut butter once a week. It's really the only lunch my younger daughter enjoys, she kind of just tolerates other stuff. PB&J has the highest success rate of actually being eaten during their lunch break. They bring home a lot of lunches that just have couple bites eaten ...

When my older daughter started, she told me about a friend that had to sit at the ""nut-free"" or ""allergy"" table away from her. I was actually a little concerned; I didn't want my daughter's lunch to affect someone else. After talking with her about it, it sounded like the teachers actually did a good job explaining nut allergies and safe practices.

"AITA for refusing to go to my sister's wedding? | Am I (28M) the asshole for not wanting to go to my sister's (24F) wedding and ending a friendship with my best friend (29M)? 

So here's some backstory: Me and my best friend have been friends since middle school. We were like brothers and we used to hang out every day. He's a good guy but I recently found out he has been dating my younger sister behind my back. I didn't know until now. It was only when my sister announced they were going to get married I knew what was going on. Apparently, they have been dating for many years and engaged for 14 months without telling anyone.

Fast forward to today, and my sister announces she's going to get married and the wedding is next week. She invited her whole family to the wedding. I thought maybe she had been secretly dating someone maybe that's why she suddenly is going to get married. And maybe she hid it from me as she knew I would disapprove as I'm overprotective? My sister is the type of girl every guy wants (blonde hair, blue eyes and she's very pretty and has big boobs). A lot of guys hit on her and I'm afraid someone will use her or hurt her so that's why I'm overprotective. But I guess she's going to get married anyway so there's nothing I can do other than to congratulate her. However, the next thing she said shocked me: Her fiance is my best friend. Apparently, they started dating in 2014 and got engaged around Christmas 2018. After hearing this, I felt betrayed and angry. I'm disappointed in both her and my best friend, especially my best friend. No one fucks their best friend's little sister. Nobody does shit like that. To make matters even worse, they hid their relationship from me and my family for 6 years. I'm going to end the friendship with my best friend (a.k.a. future brother-in-law) for being a backstabbing piece of shit. I'm done with him.  

Anyway, I told my sister that I won't go to her wedding or want to have anything to do with her soon-to-be husband and she freaked out. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and give her away (our father died three years ago and I'm her only sibling). But there is no way I'll go to her wedding. I mean my best friend is going to be my brother-in-law? It just feels too weird. So I told her to either walk down the aisle alone or find someone else to do the honor. Well, my sister started crying and begging me to come to her wedding. She says she wants my blessing. But she will never get it because I will never approve of her marriage.

We then talked with our mother and she said I'm being selfish. She also said that I should go to my sister's wedding. But I said it's my choice whether I'm going or not and no one can force me. However, my sister says I'm a horrible brother and that I hurt her feelings. I know it's her special day but I really don't want to see her fiance again.

"AITA for choosing q-tips as a hill to die on? | I am a female university student (20) living with my parents and older brother. Neither him nor I pay rent, but I pay for my own school and much of my own living expenses, in addition to contributions to the household like helping with groceries and items for around the house such as Kleenex, paper towels, or q-tips.

My brother is taking online courses which in his own words are 'very cheap' and he works 4 days a week. He barely buys his own stuff, let alone for the household. My mom buys his soap, food, bus passes, etc. He even tries to eat my food I've labeled 'NoNo' (as in 'No Noelle (my name)' - don't eat). It really pisses me off that he eats my food, takes my stuff & doesn't contribute anything. I'm fed up with it. I've brought it up to my mom several times and she always says ""I know"" or ""I can't make him contribute"" or ""I don't want to cause an argument.""

I buy q-tips to help me apply my makeup. No one else tends to use them as my parents say they're not good to stick in your ears. The other day, my brother said his ears 'felt dirty' and did we have any q-tips. I said no. Later he went into the bathroom and saw q-tips sitting in my makeup drawer. He asked if I'd forgotten I had them. I said no I hadn't but I didn't want to share them. He was like 'um excuse me.' I told him he needs to start buying his own toiletries and food and start contributing to the house more, and that it's not fair we have to buy things to support him too. He works, and frankly makes more money than me yet has less expenses because his schooling is barely $400/semester vs my upwards of $4000. 

He freaked out on me and said I'm a selfish bitch for not letting him use q-tips of all things, and that I wouldn't act this way with mom or dad. I said he was correct, because mom and dad and I have a nice, reciprocal relationship where we all buy things to share. Sometimes my mom will buy chips and wine for us all, then I'll go to the grocery store and pickup the fixings for pizza for dinner, etc. I told him it would probably be best if he became a part of the reciprocation rather than taking all the time. 

He stormed off and slammed the door to his room shut. He thinks I'm a major asshole and there's been a super thick air of tension in the house since. My mom says she understands I'm frustrated, but was this really worth it? I honestly kind of think it is.

"AITA for falling out of love with my fiancé and cancelling the wedding? | Posting from a throwaway. 

Probably should add some background info before I just say ""hey I'm the c-word that dumped her loving fiancé!"" but even that may not make me any less AH. I'm looking for honest judgement as I think it might help me in my next relationship. 

I'd been dating ""Lenny"" since sophomore year in college. Regardless of what's happened, he is a great guy; he's great looking, great job in finance, amazing with kids, steady while being a lot of fun. We never really fought and when we did I felt we resolved our issues in a pretty even handed manner. I thought I really loved him. He proposed over Easter weekend last year and we were well into wedding planning for this summer. 

We took a trip to Hawaii over his Christmas holiday vacation and we were having a great time. I have no idea why but there was an interaction he had with a waiter where Lenny just seemed like such a weakling, it's hard to explain why it bothered me so much but it was like and instantaneous wave over my body that said ""I really don't love him."" I faked it through the next 5 days of the vacation but after getting settled in a home I very flatly told him I no longer loved him and I did not want to get married. I do feel bad but it looked like he'd been shot. 

We went through all he standard breakup stuff of him wanting an explanation, wanting to get back together, go to counseling, etc... I did not want any of this stuff. In the background pretty much everyone from our common friends to my own parents and siblings think I'm some sort of awful witch who has started taking drugs. No one will listen that I just don't love him anymore. The worst part about this is that I feel very isolated from everyone I thought I could trust. 


I have started dating quite a bit and Lenny thinks this is probably proof that I was cheating on him which isn't true at all but since his word is gold and mine is dog shit at this point, it's further poisoned the well with my friends and family. 


tl;dr: I fell out of love with my fiancé and cancelled the wedding. Pretty much everyone I thought was friends or family has abandoned me. Happy to provide any info if needed.

"AItA for making my husband eat dinner at the dinner table | My husband has been working extra due to some delays because of the virus, and also has gotten himself onto a weird sleep schedule in order to partially overlap people in Japan, and it’s just a shit show. He wakes up around 3 pm, just sits around until 5 or 6, then starts working. He says at around 8 the people he needs to talk to start work. But because he starts at 5, and I make dinner at 6, he’s been trying to take it to his desk and work while eating.

I think that he should eat at the table like a normal person and that taking the food to his desk sets a bad example for our daughter. He has refused to eat with us so today I just wouldn’t give him the food unless he sat with us. He ate at the table in silence and then before I went to bed yelled at me that I have “no right” to tell him where to eat. I think if I’m making it, and my daughter and I are eating together, he should eat with us.

"AITA if I don't go to the funeral of my wife's brother cause she has dementia and barely even remembers him? | Sidenote:I am 17yo and my grandpa told me to write this for him cause he's having trouble deciding on what to do.  He told me everything and I formatted it on the computer.  

My wife is 80 and has dementia, we found out yesterday that her brother (my BIL) died last night.  We live in the US and he lives in sweden, so its a long flight.  My wife is confused and thought he died a couple days ago, and hasn't been sad at all as she doesn't really understand.  Last year we went to visit the whole family and we said a goodbye to him, and we had a mutual agreement that it was probably the last time we would see him.

"AITA for refusing to let go of my grudge against my stepfather? | Throwaway account. 

I [23M] have something of a hefty backstory. My bio father left my mum while she was pregnant and idek who he is. She remarried when I was 3 to my stepfather and had my first sister a year later. Stepfather had always been cold towards me, but when his own kid was born, he basically decided he didn't want to raise someone else's child too and I got put into care. I was in and out of the care system (mostly in it) until I was 15, when I was graciously allowed back into my family home because I was grown up enough now that he wouldn't have to deal with me. 

Now, my time in care was awful. I'm sure you've all heard the horror stories about what hapems to kids in the system sometimes, and that I don't need to go into too much detail. Any time I saw my mum I would beg her to come home but he just simply wouldn't allow it. I grew a really intense feeling of resentment towards my stepfather, and I still have it because honestly, fuck him for making me go through that. 

Now the man is sick. It could be terminal, but he's receiving treatment so potentially not. Mum wants me to make ammends with him, just in case, but I've no interest in that. I've told her as much, and told her why. She keeps telling me to ""see his side"", like that makes it any better. He shoved me into the system because he's too proud to raise another man's child? What kind of a justification is that? Mum keeps talking about how difficult it was for him to have a child with a disability, which he does as my second sister has Down's syndrome, but that's also a bs justification because: 1. I'd already been in the system for *four years* when she was born and 2. Her intellectual disability/developmental delay is really mild and she's honestly more or less on the same level as other kids her age and always has been, so it isn't like she has really difficult to cater to special needs. He's tried using the ""problem child"" excuse, and while it's true I acted out as a teenager, I believe that was a result of being in the system, not vice versa. 

TL;DR: my stepdad put me in care when my sister was born bc he didn't want to raise another man's kid now he had his own. Now he's sick and wants forgiveness but I still hold him responsible for the hellish experience I had in the system.",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_91

Problem is, my rm just somehow loves to provoke drama. It started off with her bf staying over rent free and not doing anything. Raising our utilities about 50 bucks higher. So I confronted her on that. Then recently she had the nerve to go on twitter and post about how dare I whine/complain about caring for her dog.

"AITA for getting mad at my parents? | My parents went on a vacation this month to a far away country and I'm away from home as well. So to take care of our dog we made a deal: we would let the veterinarian take care of him.

"AITA for using language practice as an excuse to chat up girls I don't know? | Changed a few details but I think the gist stays the same

I recently met up with a female friend. We also talked about dating and she mentioned how she'd been using Tinder and that she found it was easy to get matches but actually finding a good partner on it so far proved to be difficult. She then wanted to know what my experience with it was and I told her I didn't really use it. So what did I do then to meet girls, she asked.

I mentioned a few things and I also said that I'd started to talk to attractive Asian girls (since I have a bit of a thing for them anyway), who I presumed were Chinese (somewhat of a decent number in the city we're at), also asking if they spoke Chinese and then mentioning that I'd learned the language for a almost three years in college (I did) but that it was difficult to get actual practice now since I didn't really know many Chinese people. And later I'd ask if I could add her on WhatsApp since even writing with someone could be useful. After writing a bit some time later I might ask her if she'd sometime like to get coffee together, and so on.

This actually doesn't work that badly, only issue is that it doesn't work with Korean women, and you actually have to speak the language. But it's better than just talking to them for no reason, way better success rate. 

However my friend didn't seem to like my approach much. She argued it was insincere of me to claim it was for getting language practise when I was just trying to get with them. I tried to explain to her how being too direct wouldn't be good and that I of course also saw the additional practice as beneficial for myself but she argued that I should rather be honest and that if I was actually interested in the language I would also talk to Chinese guys or Asian girls who I didn't think were hot.

"AITA for complaining to my neighbors about their dogs barking and charging the fence? | Background: I live on a couple of acres in a somewhat rural, outside of city limits neighborhood. It’s perfectly acceptable to raise chickens etc. out here and I have several, as well as a few geese, ducks, and a pair of turkeys. They are penned in a run that stretches nearly the entire length of the north border of my property. The neighbor to the north and I are separated by a hedge with a chicken wire fence woven through it.

About a year ago, said neighbor’s girlfriend moved in and brought her Weimaraner with her. The dog barked at the birds CONSTANTLY, barked at us CONSTANTLY, and barked EVEN MORE when we played with our German Shepherd out in the yard. The most that the neighbor and his girlfriend would do was to call the dog inside (when they were home, that is) but he would reappear within minutes because he has a dog door. Thankfully, my husband realized he could lower his voice and yell the dog’s name and a sharp “no!” and scare the dog into silence. Finally the dog got the message to quit barking at us.

Now these same folks have a puppy. They’ve had the new Weimaraner for about six or seven months and it’s the same thing with the additional complication that this one also slams himself into the fence growling and snapping at us. I take my toddler out to feed our birds and collect eggs every morning and I can’t even talk to her or enjoy my time outside because of the noise and watching out to make sure this dog doesn’t come through the hedge and actually attack us.

We wrote the neighbors a note explaining that we can’t enjoy our own yard and pets and what can we do to resolve the situation? Their reply was to tell us that birds are distracting to “hunting dogs” and that we should also expect the dogs to bark when we “approach their yard.” They suggested we relocate the birds and don’t approach their dogs.

First of all, the birds’ run has their pond and all of their nesting sites and coops, and would involve relocating almost 400’ of fence on top of that. Second, their dog is the problem, not the birds. Third, shouldn’t we be able to walk right up to our own hedge without it being considered approaching or annoying their dogs? I plan on replying by telling the neighbors to handle their business or I’ll call animal control, but I’d like to know if I’m at all in the wrong here.",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_106

Usually when I try to make plans with him I always get the typical ""sure, I don't have any plans yet but I can't if I am spontaneously going out"" which in 80% of all cases means that he won't have time since he would rather hang out with other people (notifiying me half an hour before we were planned to meet), making me sort of feel like the second choice he has to do something with when all his other plans get cancelled.

I don't know how many times I was stood up waiting for him just to get a text half an hour before telling me that he won't come.

Today, he asked me if I wanted to go out to eat something, but I was already invited by my family for dinner. So I told him I can't come.
As a result to this, he got a bit mad and said that I should cancel since I can have dinner with my family any other day as well.
I refused, saying that they invited me weeks ago unlike him (2 hours before he wanted to go out) and if he wanted to reschedule.

It never got to the reschedule part since he was so mad at me for being so unspontaneous, that I did not get another answer.

I work at a massage clinic as a massage therapist. We have had several issues this year with theft by employees. Not only theft of our cash tips but money from the register and items left by clients in the lost and found in the office safe. We do have cameras in the lobby, the office and the break room.  
After I came back to work after my weekend, I noticed that in my cubby spot that hangs on the wall, a few very low value items are missing. Several of us have this item at work.

Mine (21 f) and my sister’s (24) mom and dad divorced when we were very young. I’ll admit my dad has been an asshole in the past, but they’ve always had a custody agreement. We would visit my dad most weekends and in between he would call and send cute letters and stuff. He has some issues such as temperament but it’s because when he was younger he got thyroid cancer after serving in the Air Force and they removed his whole thyroid and his meds don’t help a lot with keeping his hormones in balance. 

Anyways, he didn’t pay a lot of child support when I was growing up because he’s always been extremely poor. Not only that, but my mom had a huge problem with accruing debt. We lived with my grandma growing up and she would take out credit cards in my grandmas name, max them out, and then not pay them. She’d also buy a ton of clothes with the money that was supposed to go to bills, so occasionally our water or electricity would get shut off. So he didn’t want her to spend all that money on herself instead of us girls. 

A couple years ago she got my grandmas ( moms mom) house that we had lived in since I was 3 foreclosed on, even though it had a reverse mortgage. She didn’t have to pay on the mortgage all those years, she just wouldn’t pay the property tax until eventually they wanted a ton of money and she didn’t have it so it got foreclosed. 

So now, my dad has been diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer. He’s making all of his death arrangements while he’s been going through treatment.  

My mom told me that because my grandma on my dads side is so rich (and she also has stage 4 cancer in her breasts that metastasized to lungs and lymph nodes)  she’s going to try to take the money my dad owes her out of his inheritance from my grandma. 

I’m upset because not only is she trying to go after my dying father and grandmother, she would be taking the money that my dad was going to leave to my sister and I. I know it’s shitty that he didn’t pay his child support all the way but he’s been sending her $20 a month because that’s all he has now and he didn’t want to give it to her just for her to spend it on herself instead of us and the bills because she was doing a shitty job of taking care of us. 

I don’t want to be a spoiled brat and say “that’s my money!!” Because it’s not, but she’s trying to go after my dying father and grandmother that I love a lot. And also it just seems a little shitty to take your children’s inheritance,  even if that person owes you money.

I hope I explained that okay.",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_130

"WIBTA for not inviting this person to my birthday party? | Quick background: I'm a hostess at a restaurant. There's only 4 of us.

So I'm planning on throwing a birthday party. I literally have not had a party since middle school and I've spent every birthday alone. This is the first time I've actually wanted to celebrate my birthday, so it's a little special for me.

I became good friends with all of the hostesses except one, we'll call her Patty.

Patty is rude, mean, snotty and condescending. She treats everything like a competition and you can't have a conversation without her making it about herself. All around unpleasant person.

It's to the point where a couple of the hostesses, me included, have had to report her to management because of her behavior.

Point is: I don't like Patty.

But also: I don't like excluding people.

I've been bullied all throughout my school life and I even had to leave my previous job because of bullying, so I have a soft spot regarding that.

The restaurant has such a small crew that it wouldn't take that long for her to realize she would be the only hostess not invited and it makes me feel hella guilty. Being excluded from stuff hurts and I don't want to inflict that on someone else, even someone as unpleasant as Patty. I don't want to feel like I'm stooping to her level.

On the other hand, it's my birthday and I want to celebrate it with friends and loved ones. It's supposed to be a joyous, drama-free, positive occasion and I don't want someone there who will make me or other guests uncomfortable.

Would I be an asshole if I didn't invite her?

Or should I just extend the invite to be nice and then pray to all the powers-at-be that she doesn't come?",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_135

"AITA for being angry at my boyfriend for claiming to be Italian? | My boyfriend claims he's Italian. He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.

His mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised ""the Italian way"", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. 

As things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.

But it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like ""I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian"". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.

Just because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?

"AITA for giving a presentation at school which basically criticizes most people at the school? | So I (17M) am in a bit of a weird position. I'm not the bullied kid. I mean people tried to bully me once, but it just didn't work. I've always had a fierce confidence, so whenever someone tried to bully me and I bit back, they knew it was going to be too much headache and gave up. 

Nor am I a popular kid. Nor am I considered one of the ''normal'' types who just floats around going unnoticed.

I've always been told by girls that I'm good looking (have sharp jawline and go gym a lot), so looking at me, most people *think* that I'd be one of those popular types, but I just wasn't. I consciously decided *not* to be that stereotype - the fit and athletic jock who is a hit with everyone. I *could* have been that person like my older brother, but I chose not to. 

There's valid criticisms of me too - I'm arrogant, quick to assume and sometimes lack empathy, however I'm self aware and honest about it. 

This brings me to the presentation. In one of my classes, we were tasked with giving an individual presentation on a topic that is important to us - something that is *personal* to us. So of course most people gave topics on a range of issues; ranging from health issues, to societal issues, etc. 

My topic? I used this as a platform to criticize our school. Rather than take aim at the system , I took aim at my school specifically. I didn't name anyone in particular, however I did broadly criticize certain groups. Noone was safe - teachers, jocks, cheerleaders, criticized.

Essentially, my presentation said the following:

- The teachers at the school are lazy and unhelpful. For the most part, they don't pay attention much and seem unbothered in class. 

- Many of the girls, especially those who cheerlead (but also those who do not) are too obsessed with social media. My main point here was shallowness. Both guys and girls are shallow, but our school has a bad reputation for instagram wannabes. I said that perhaps those who cheerlead should focus more on academics, and less on empty validation

- Many of the athletes would benefit from being better role models. They are in a position of great responsibility, and yet our town has had multiple instances of these jocks drunk driving and causing damage. There is a high correlation with our school's jocks and drunk driving incidents

- Many on the debate team and choir should seek help for their mental health. This wasn't an indictment of them, but me standing up for them

The school is a bit clique-y, moreso than other schools I've seen. But **I specifically backed up my presentation with evidence - mainly with statistics and my opinion, backed with some philosophy.**

The teacher was not happy, but he did not get me in trouble. In fact, I was surprised that he said it was really thoughtful. The other students mostly pissed off. Then some girls called me a huge asshole, that I'm insensitive. I may see their point...I do have a tendency of being insensitive, but my teacher did praise me. AITA?",wrong,commonsense,ethics_142
"AITA for understanding my friend's ex? | So this story involves me and my friend. For about a year she had a boyfriend and seemed to be  happy. At some point she met another guy. They got close pretty fast, but she said that they are just friends. After some time she told me that she thinks she is poly. She was afraid that I would hate her. I told her that I don't have a problem with that. As long as she is happy, I am happy for her. She said that she is in love with her boyfriend and the new guy friend. She wants therefore an open relationship, but is afraid how her boyfriend will react if she asks him. I encouraged her to talk to him.

&#x200B;

A couple of days later she talked with him and that he wasn't sure if he would be ok with an open relationship. He wanted some time to think about it. 

&#x200B;

The next day he calls her and says that he can't do it. He breaks up with her, but wishes her the best. She immediately calls me and is freaking out. She says she is in shock that he broke up. She never would have seen it coming that he would just break up. I am confused and say that I am not so shocked, because he already said yesterday that he isn't sure. She calls me heartless bitch and that she definitly never thought that he would break up. She also claims to have a heart attack. I tell her that she probably has a Panic attack and to take some Deep breaths to calm down. She doesn't listen to it and rants on About how ruthless her now ex boyfriend is until she suddenly hangs up.

&#x200B;

I didn't really know what to do after that. I didn't contact her to not upset her. She texted me a couple of days later:

&#x200B;

Her: i am still upset that you haven't apologized yet.

&#x200B;

Me: i don't really know what to apologize for. I stand by what i said. It was not a sudden shock to you. You knew before that he could break up. He even said that he wasn't sure. But i understand that the timing wasn't right for me to say that. So i apologize for saying that straight away when you were very emotional. I should have talked to you about that at a later point.

&#x200B;

Her: that's not what you did wrong. It was a sudden break up. I didn't know that he would even consider breaking up. I could have never guessed that! Why are you in his side?

&#x200B;

Me: that is just not the truth. When you told me that you are poly you said you were worried how he would react. And when you told him, he said he needs time to think about it. To me it was pretty clear that he could break up with you. And to be honest, i can understand him. Apparently he doesn't want an open relationship and so he rather breaks it up with you than to keep a relationship going that would make both of you unhappy. Maybe it is better that way.

"WIBTAH If I Skipped My Brother's Wedding | I will make this quick and save most of you the trouble of reading a lot.  I am a Lt in the military and I work as a pilot.

A few months ago both my wife of three years and our child died while she was giving birth.  Everyone tells me how sorry they are, how amazing of a woman she was, how much of a great father I would’ve have been.   I don’t like hearing it, I don’t want to know what I could have been, should have been, or would have been because it doesn’t exist anymore.  

My brother is getting married later this summer and everyone is preparing for that.  I’m really happy for them and both families.  Plus it slowly took everyone’s focus off me and they can focus on the happier future.  I was obviously going to be a groomsmen for him, was going to give a speech after the best man, and just tease him in front of his new wife and family.  My wife was looking forward to it and so was everyone else.  People say they like my speeches and toasts, and my wife used to joke that every time I talk the room gets quiet so everyone can hear what I say.  

I just don’t think I’m mentally prepared to go to my brother’s wedding.  I don’t think I’ll be ready in a few months either.  I already texted him it’s hard for me to meet up with the groomsmen once a month when they go out to dinner and plan stuff out.  Thankfully he understands due to my job but the reality is I just don’t want to be around it.  It’s not out of hate or angry or sorrow, I just really want to be alone and focus on work.  It’s the only thing that keeps me going.  That rush I feel when I take off at full speed and push the throttle harder once I’m soaring.  Twisting the stick and pushing my body to feel that high.  It’s the drive and push keeping me going and takes my mind off my miserable life.  

I’ve been thinking of asking my commander for a TDY or if I could deploy with another squadron during the summer.  Just hoping I can give a valid excuse why I can’t go to the wedding.  I promise I’ll pay my brother his wedding respects before and after the wedding, I’ll even go over to his place once he’s married and spoil them with gifts.

I know it’s a horrible thing to not want to go to my little brother’s wedding but I honestly can’t do it.  Every day I wish something would just happen to me during a flight exercise or while I’m driving to work or even some accident at work.  My brother deserves a better brother who won’t abandon his wedding and I’m sorry I can’t be that stronger older brother.

I said Mr. Anderson. That's who it was, but they said o was wrong. Then my opponent buzzed in and said Hank Hill.

I have been trying to save up money for a new car so I told him I really cannot spend money to go out.

In reality I only get about 100 to spend for 2 weeks and the rest goes to savings. so I really have to budget everything in and end up using every cent towards other expenses and groceries. I know I could put less in savings but I need a car in less than 3 weeks. I’m really scrambling for money because I do not have a credit score so I can’t get a loan. I told him if he wants me to go out with him he’s going to have to pay until I get everything settled. He seemed fine with it until we go out again and he asks me the same thing while we are at the restaurant. At this point I’m tired of it and just tell him I won’t be going out to eat with him. Then he blames me saying I just don’t know how to spend my money correctly and it doesn’t cost a lot to eat out.

"AITA for asking my wife to visit her OBGYN after we have been having trouble conceiving? | As the totals suggests, I [28m] and my wife [27f] have been trying for a child for about 6 months.

She has a bleeding disorder and a family history of ovarian cysts, and I am a bit concerned about whether or not we will even be able to have children. 
Yesterday, we found out that for yet another month, we were unsuccessful. In my frustration, I put my hands on my head and she immediately followed with “why are you making this about you?” I tried to explain that I was struggling with each month getting our hopes up and that she probably felt the same way. She didn’t want to hear my side and it ended in an argument about how I “make it about me.” I can understand how I could have put my feelings aside, but in the moment after hearing a “no” again, I was a bit distraught.
I followed up by suggesting that she go and get a check up. For the last 9 months she has been without insurance (quit her job to pursue a dream of hers, and has no benefits). I recently was able to get her on my benefits, and so this is a possibility. She is making the claim that it is her body, and that it is her decision. I can’t force her to go get checked up. 
Her big Hangup is that doctors typically say that you need to try to conceive for 1 year before bothering them with any concerns of issues with pregnancy. We are at month 6. I suggested that my wife tell a white lie (how will they know when we started anyway?) in order to find out if there are any issues with her bleeding disorder, or cysts. She again reiterated that it isn’t my choice, and that she wanted to wait for a year.

I was visibly upset about this and approached Steph the next time we worked together to ask to her to please return the money. She replied “Well, our supervisor neglected to buy us beverages for the pizza, so I used the money for that”. I reminded her that the jar money was not for that purpose, and to please return the money. Steph then replied “Once our supervisor pays me the money she owes me for the party rentals, I’ll return the jar money” (At this point I should mention that we had our Xmas party at Steph’s house. Apparently she rented some tables and chairs for the party, and our supervisor was supposed to pay her back for the rentals, but never did.) I told her that I have nothing to do with that, this is a separate issue, and she still refused.

Time goes by, she got reimbursed for the chairs, and I repeatedly asked Steph to return the money, and she still refuses. For what reason, I don’t know. I tried everything, reasoning with her, publicly shaming her, etc. Finally, after many months, (seriously) I had enough and told our supervisor about Steph taking the money, and refusing to pay it back. Finally, after a lot of back in forth, Steph returns the money. But now, quite a few people at work are upset at me for “making a big deal out of it” and getting Steph in trouble. I personally don’t care about the backlash, and it’s the principle of the matter that matters to me. Some of my coworkers even told me “I can’t believe you made such a big deal over $15” And now I am second guessing my decision to tell my supervisor.

Am I the asshole?

"AITA for telling my sons' father that if he wants to be in their life, he should help support them? | Background: Several years ago, I was seeing someone, Mark, casually. We got along well, enjoyed each other, and after about a year despite taking precautions, I got pregnant. We hadn't specifically discussed what we would do, and to make it more complicated, we found out early on that I was pregnant with twins. He was uncertain at first, and decided after not too long that he wasn't ready to be a father. I didn't want to force him, and I'm super fortunate to have a job that allowed/allows me to support my little family, as well as a wonderful social network. So, we parted ways, I let him know when the boys were born, and I asked that he at least keep me up to date on his contact information, in case of emergency, or if they wanted to meet him some day.

On to the issue: My sons are now almost three, they're beautiful, sweet, gregarious little dudes, and I don't have a single regret in the world. I recently got engaged to the love of my life (John). Shortly after we announced our engagement, I heard from Mark again, first time since a few weeks the boys were born.

He didn't mention the engagement, but I'm pretty sure someone told him, and that's why he reached out. I won't lie, I was taken aback, and I just don't like the idea of adding him back into the mix and making things more complicated... So this could for sure be coloring my responses, and I want to be sure I'm being fair.

Mark wants to see his sons. He specifically talked about seeing them ""a few times, where \[they\] can play"" and ""see how it goes"". To me, this sounds like he wants a trial run or something, and then decide if he enjoys it enough to see them more. I told him that although I'm absolutely open to him seeing the boys and being part of their lives, I'm not comfortable with what seems like a trial run setup, and that I would like him to decide, or we could meet and discuss, whether he wants to be an ongoing part of their life, and what that would look like. I also told him that if he does want to be involved, that I'll be expecting him to pay some form of child support from here on out, although we'd need to figure out what that looks like.

It's been three years, he's met them only once, and as awesome as my kids are, they're still a serious handful, and parenting isn't something you just get to do when it's fun. I don't want someone in and out of their lives, I want them to have consistent, loving people around. Mark got pretty angry, accused me of being with John just to replace him, and basically of trying to extort money from him and keeping his kids hostage. I feel like I'm trying to put reasonable expectations and boundaries out there, but I don't want to deny my boys the chance to know their father, and I'm worried that my kneejerk reaction is too strong and I'm being unreasonable.

"AITA if I stop paying my daughter’s tuition over a disgusting comment she made towards my new girlfriend? | My (56M) wife died at the young age of 51 from a car accident. I was in deep mourning for about a year after her death. I met my new GF C (43F) around January. C was the one who made me laugh for the first time after my wife died. She’s smart as hell (3 Ivy League degrees), has a dark sense of humor that I love, a terrific cook, and overall an amazing woman who I can imagine spending the rest of my life with. She is also on the heavier side, a fact that becomes relevant later.

I have 2 children, E (25M) and A (19F). They were well aware that I had gotten a new GF before I first introduced them to C this summer. She got along immediately with E, but A was very very standoffish. After that initial meeting I asked A if there was something wrong but she denied it. C made a few more attempts to get to know A but they were all rudely rejected.

E and A both came home for Thanksgiving dinner. I asked A to please be polite during the meal since she’s always been rude in her interactions with C even though C has been nothing but gracious in return. The dinner was going as well as it could have for the first 10 minutes, although I noticed A glaring at C the entire time. When C went to grab her third helping of mashed potatoes, A said “Don’t you think you’ve eaten enough, you fat pig?” C started sobbing immediately and ran off into the bedroom. I felt my face turn red and told A to get out. 

About half an hour after A left I texted her stating that I would no longer pay her tuition unless 1. She apologized to C and 2. C accepts her apology. A must have assumed that I was bluffing because she instead doubled down on her behavior during Thanksgiving dinner. I then logged into her university’s tuition payment website, canceled next semester’s tuition, and sent A the screenshots.

So to make the long story short.

I was going to a uni that's ranked 1200-1400 in the world ( it's the best in my country ) and told almost everyone about it. My friends were excited. My gf was excited because we'll see each other A LOT more and everyone was so happy.

"AITA For Partially Ruining my Relationship With my Mom? | My parents first bought me a tablet when I was 14. I used it for 2 years before my mom got mad at me and smashed it on the floor and intentionally breaking it. So I was without any electronics for another year because, personally, I find tv boring. Then when I was 17, I got a job and bought my own phone. It wasn't a very good phone, but it was new at the time and since I bought it with my own money, I treasured it. I was under the mindset that my parents weren't allowed to do anything to it because I bought it and not them. Yet again, 2 years later, my mom intentionally broke it. I got really mad at my mom because it belonged to me and I spent 4 months working 4 hours a day at minimum wage for it. When I was 24, finished college, and got a job, I managed to move out and support myself by my own. I had a great paying job so I managed to buy much more stuff. Yet again, I was under the mindset that since I was no longer living off of my parents, they could do nothing to anything I own. For my 25th birthday, I invited my parents over. My mom got kind of upset that I moved out because from where they immigrated from, females live with their parents for their entire life. I began arguing that we don't live there anymore and I'm allowed to do anything I want. Long story short, my mom got mad at me and smashed the vase on the dinner table.

"AITA for saying ""hey"" as a greeting? | I'm 34, college educated, grew up in the deep south, had an accent for a long time, traveled the country in my early 20s. Now my accent passes for Midwestern, and I live in Northwest Indiana, just outside of Chicago. 

For the vast majority of my speaking life, I have said ""Hey"" as a greeting. Hello is used for the phone, opening my door to delivery drivers, and when speaking in a professional atmosphere like a meeting (retail management, not board room). I never say Hi. I just don't. I don't know why. It feels awkward to make myself say it 

In the last few months my 35 year old husband has decided that it annoys him that I say ""hey"" to the point that he must say something. Meeting him at the door when he comes home for work? Can't say ""hey!"" because he gets upset. Why? Because he says it's rude. Tells me it's disrespectful.

I am not yelling HEY! to get his attention. I'm using it to greet him and use a friendly tone.

In the 3 decades I've used the word, not a single person has ever been offended by it, or at least never bothered to tell me it was offensive. I've googled it, and nothing suggests it's disrespectful. In fact, most people seem to use it when greeting someone who's known more intimately than just an acquaintance.

"AITA for refusing to apologize to my dad? | I wrote about this a little bit on a different account, but I'm feeling conflicted so here i am writing again.

Backstory: my dad found un-used birth control under my bed about a month ago and was extremely angry over the fact that 1.) I had birth control and 2.) I had it sent to my bfs house. Keep in mind that my parents are extremely strict and religious and can't even see my underwear on the bathroom floor without freaking out

Main story: my dad hasn't spoken a single word to me since the incident. Completely straight up ignores me and just acts like I don't exist. He won't even look at me if I walk by. My step mom on the other hand talks to me sometimes, but only to tell me how sad she is that I'm not like the other girls at church.

It's been hard dealing with this. I'm not comfortable in my own home. I can't even go downstairs to eat right now and I'm starving. They won't let my little brother hang out with me. They made family holiday plans for the 4th and didn't bother inviting me.

My bf and his mom think that I should apologize for ever hiding the birth control in the first place, but mostly to ""make peace"" but I don't want to. I feel like their punishment is too harsh and it's hurting me. I'm completely alone. I have over $1000 in bills to pay and I can't even attend college this year because I don't have the money and they don't help with anything.

"AITA for repeatedly telling my mother she will never become a grandmother? | My mother and I have had one massive source of conflict over the last decade or so: she wants grandkids, I will never give her any.

&#x200B;

Some facts about me (that my mother knows and acknowledges to various degrees) :

* 32 years old, only child
* a lesbian but not exactly interested in having a relationship with anyone
* have been vocally childfree/child-negative since I was about 14 years old
* vocally pro-choice and openly say I would get an abortion if I ever got pregnant for any reason, even though they are illegal in our country

&#x200B;

And yet, whenever I talk to my mother, she never fails to bring up:

* my female cousins having babies/my male cousins impregnating women
* me finding a man and getting pregnant asap
* me possibly having 'an accident' that ends in pregnancy (I'm *pretty* sure she means an 'oops baby'...)
* my clock ticking
* how her sisters are all grandmas already and she is not

"AITA for ditching my friends for being losers? | So I'll straight up admit it: in the context of high schoo, I could be considered a huge, huge loser. I'm 15 and I've never been to a party, never kissed a girl, don't play any sports, and my face looks like the aftermath of a war due to acne. 

So my entire 'friend group' are losers as well. I never really liked them to begin with, but just hang out with them because they're the only people that accept me. But honestly, I hate everything about them. They sit around all day playing video games like lazy asses. They don't make any effort to improve themselves. They think they're edgy by hating on popular kids as dumb. They're basically okay with the fact they're losers. 

I'm not. I want to improve my life, want to be popular, want to have friends I don't hate, and I want girls to actually like me. So I drew out an entire plan. Step 1 is to ditch all these 'friends' that are dragging me down. They hurt me in multiple ways: socially, associating with them hurts my reputation, and hanging out with them hurts me instead of helps me, because they never do anything productive or useful. So I ditched them and started doing a lot if self-improvement: getting rid of my acne, working out, learning how to dress, and 0racticing social skills. My goal is to be more popular by the time sophomore year rolls around. And so far, it's been great. I look so much better, and people say I'm unrecognizable. The progress is exhilarating.

But today, I randomly ran into one of my ex-friends, Ryan. He immediately was pissed off I ditched them/wouldn't hang out with them anymore. He then called me out for being a 'poser' and trying to act popular. I explained that's exactly the reason I don't want to hang out with them anymore. When I try to improve, instead of helping me, they just want to drag me back down to their level.

Ever since then she's been very scared to take elevators and takes the stairs instead anytime she can. I think that's ridiculous, because it's been a long time since she got stuck and she wasn't even stuck for that long. I think it's annoying and stupid to use the stairs and make others wait. 

Last night we were all going to a restaurant to celebrate our dad's 50th birthday. We parked in a parking hall headed to the elevator.

"AITA for cutting off friends of a decade who won’t oay me back? | For my birthday, I decided to do something special and take a trip to a large city where most of my friends live to throw a big bar crawl. I invited some friends from my hometown and booked the rooms, since I get a big hotel discount. I worked overtime for 2 weeks and used the extra money as a budget to set aside for my weekend in the city. While we were out, I got a massive bucket drink under the agreement that everyone would venmo me for part of the cost split up equally. My hometown friends were also in agreement that they would pay me back for the room. As the night went on, one friend refused to pay for cover or drinks, and kept trying to tell everyone where she wanted to go and refused to go on my birthday, so I got fed up and told her if she didn’t want to pay for anything and kept throwing a fit about going to where she wanted to go then she could go home, which she did. I paid for the rest of their covers because one of their cards wouldn’t work and the other had to pay a huge service fee for withdrawing, under the agreement I would be paid back with venmo. In total, they owe me about $150, which isn’t a lot to some, but it is to me as a broke grad student, and it blew my budget for going out. 

They refuse to pay me back- one of them agreed to venmo me and then when I mentioned it the next day, she smirked and said she never had venmo and would never download it. The other two are similar. I tried texting and calling them with no response, and when I sent a paragraph a week and a half later, one of them accused me of being heartless for asking her to pay me back while her dog was in the hospital (which she never mentioned to me at all), and then refused to pay me back, saying I would get the money whenever she felt like sending it. The other two want my exact banking info (routing and account number) to pay me back. When I refused and suggested paypal, venmo, or cashapp, they got angry at me and then stopped responding, leading me to think it’s a scam. When my dad passed and they came to my house for the first time, they kept making side comments on how “rich” I was, how big the house is, the cars in the driveway, etc even though financially, I’m on my own and have been since undergrad. 

I’ve been close friends with them for over a decade and am in shock they’d pull something like this.

"AITA for calling our friend by a name my bf doesn’t like? | My boyfriend and I (also male)have a “friend” (we’ll call him Dave). I use “friend” in quotations because our relationship is very strange. 

Backstory: Bf and I have been together for 7 years. Dave got my bf a job, and is now getting him a job to work directly with Dave. Great, that’s a pay raise and my bf seems really excited about this job.

So my bf and I always thought Dave was a very attractive man, and would talk about him  casually (that’s a great part about being in a gay relationship). One night while we were out drinking, we ran into Dave. Here’s the first issue: I went home because I knew I had enough to drink. My bf decided to stay out (he’s an adult, I trust him nbd). The next morning when I woke up, my bf told me that Dave was gay. My bf went back to Dave’s place (we had done so a couple times before) but this time he put the moves on my bf. Bf was shocked and said he casually and quickly left.

After some talks, my bf, Dave, and i decide to just go for it. We fooled around a couple times, everything was very casual. But I noticed that Dave seemed to prefer my bf. I get it, I’m used to it. I’m not a huge guy but I am bigger than my bf, and Dave told me he preferred skinny guys (my bf is skinny). This caused me a lot of self-doubt and I decided I was done with this whole mess.

After talking to my bf about this, he agreed that everything needed to “cool down,” yet we would still find ourselves back at Dave’s despite me not wanting to. This whole relationship was causing a lot of stress on mine and my bf’s relationship. 

My bf started going to Dave’s house after work by himself (not often, maybe once or twice a week) I was very uncomfortable with this, as my bf has had some infidelity issues in the past. He insisted it was no big deal. I offered to just join them, I’ll just play a game on my phone while they talk or whatever, but he was insistent on the fact that they had to be alone. Weird, right?

After some sleuthing, I did discover that some things were going on behind my back. Nothing too crazy, but a lot of emotional cheating and a little physical cheating as well. 

Obviously this didn’t go over well. I was ready to end things with my bf. After talking, we agreed to work it out. He agreed to focus on our relationship more and focus less on Dave. Great! But he still goes to Dave’s house once a week by himself. He says it’s all work talk but and insists nothing else is going on. I’m trusting him on that.

So... Anytime bf goes over to Dave’s house or I see his texting him I’ll refer to Dave as “Mister Mistress.” I do it as a joke to make me feel better and try to be lighthearted about everything.

My bf has mixed reactions. He usually gets pissed off and tells me not to call Dave that name. Sometimes he just laughs it off, but I can tell it annoys him.

I have a huge meeting that could give me a promotion, so I'm 100% not going to pride this year. this promotion could help me and her so much. 

I told my 14 year old daughter that if she could find another adult to take her I would let her go, but it has to be a adult.
I explained to her that this pride parade ends at 11pm and I dont want her alone with drunk adults, and she has also never been to one so I worry she could get lost. 

she asked if dad could take her and i said dad can't take you either as he will be in Australia with his brother. 
so I told her to see if any of her friends moms could take her. said that she does not want them to take her and that she will be fine on her own and does not need a parent. 
I think she only wants her parents to take her. 

I also asked if her pride group was going and if she could tag along, but they are not. 

I then told her that there needs to be a adult or she can't go, simple as that.  she got super mad and stormed into her room.

"AITA for having the police remove a homeless person? | My kids wanted to go to a park near the house today and after a lot of stalling on my part, I finally agreed, and they were *thrilled*. 

It’s not a huge park, just a little local job with a play structure and a couple swings directly adjacent. 

I get there and see a kid having a full blown meltdown about not being able to go into the park and the mother was telling her “I know I promised but we can’t go today” and I couldn’t help but overhear it, but it was none of my business, so I kept on. 

But the mother stopped me and whispered “There’s a homeless guy living in the play structure, you don’t want your kids in there.”

I wasn’t really sure what she meant but knew how amped my kids had been for the park so decided I had to see for myself. 

Sure enough there was a guy sleeping under the covered portion of the play structure. I thought about it for a second and this park was put here for kids to play in. We have other municipal structures in place for homeless people. 

So I went over and called to him and said it was morning, the park was now in use, so he needed to continue on. 

He ignored me and went back to sleep. I told him if he didn’t leave the playground I’d have to call someone. He muttered something to the effect of “go away.”

I called the police’s non emergency number and explained the situation. They sent a cop over who talked to him and assessed his state of mind and determined he was fine and offered him some resources and a ride. 

The guy refused to leave. The cop told him he’d have to leave. He got into it with the cop. The cop told him leave now or be arrested now. The guy eventually left.

"AITA for not cleaning up after my brother? | So I (18f) and my twin brother live in an apartment near our college a few hours away from home. My brother leaves the daily chores such as cooking and cleaning up to me and that was fine. I grew up helping my mom around the house so nothing really changed. We recently had our sem break and I decided to come home while my brother said he'd stay. When I came back a week later the apartment was absolutely disgusting. Cup noodles left on the table and floors, piles of dishes unwashed, clothes everywhere. Naturally the food attracted cockroaches. In the time we had been in the apartment there had never been cockroaches since I've always been afraid of them, especially those that fly. I immediately barged in my brother's room and woke him up. I got upset that he'd let the apartment go this bad. We had quite the heated argument where I basically told him how lazy he was and he implied that I was the maid so I was suppose to be the one to clean up. After the fight he left the apartment and I did clean up his mess because the apartment was so disgusting I couldn't stand it. Now it's been a few days later and I refused to do the cleaning and cooking for him. I washed my dishes but ignored his, washed and ironed my clothes but not his, didn't cook for him anymore and I've been ignoring anything he says that isn't an apology but he refuses to apologize saying he wasn't in the wrong. And now he apparently told our mom what I've been doing and she's mad at me. When I tried to explain to her what happened she told me that boys will be boys and that it's my job as the girl to mind the house.

Second, if common courtesy is 10 pm, and she's an hour ahead of me, that means if she texts me at 10 pm, she's breaking her own rule of thumb by really calling or texting at 11 pm her time!

I asked her why and she said she wants a new insurance policy (I’m still on my parents’ insurance). She just got a new insurance policy three weeks ago, so I asked her why she was getting a new one.  I really didn’t mean this question any type of way, I was just curious because it sounded like a really good policy (for what little I know of insurance) and because of the new policy I am able to get an IUD not covered by the last one so I was excited to take advantage of that. She doesn’t know the last part and I didn’t mention it.  Plus, she didn’t need my SSN the last time she was shopping around for a new policy, so it struck me as odd that she suddenly needed it now. I do have my problems with my mother but I don’t think she’d do anything intentionally malicious. I was just curious about what my SSN was needed for and why. I did tell her what it was. She collected other information she needed to call for quotes. The entire phone conversation took less than 5 minutes.

"AITA for telling my wife I wasn’t happy with her parenting? | Hi Reddit 
Just had a pretty big blowout with the wife and my kids, and need some perspective. To be clear, my wife is an amazing mother and person, and I respect and love her more than anything. 

I am home now for obvious reasons, but typically am only home 1-2 weekends a month about 10 months out of the year. For 1-2 months I’m working from home. This is usually during summer time or I can do it so I’m home all nov/Dec, which also works out well for the family as kids aren’t at school for the most part. 

I have 6 kids: 16f , 15m , 11 year old twins both girls, 9m and 7m. My wife has not worked since our second child was born, which we both prefer. 

I have never worried too much about how she runs things when she’s home with the kids, which is mostly all the time. I worry about big picture stuff and how the kids are doing, but routine and day to day things I stay out of her way and trust her completely to handle that unless I’m asked for input. 

Now that I’m home, I am noticing some things I don’t care for. Some examples: 
- the twins are incredibly bossy to the younger boys. 6 months ago, twins and 9yr old were inseparable but now they act like their 16 year old sister. Wife is not bothered by this 
-  15 year old seems to think the entire basement is his domain and doesn’t want anyone else going down there while he plays video games. Wife makes no effort to curb this
- 7yr old recently celebrated 3 years being cancer free and naturally is a little behind for his age. He’s all caught up in school and pretty close to on par developmentally, but socially is cripplingly attached to his mother and 16yr old sister. No effort has been made by my wife to push him socially. 

The fight stems from this last issue. He was excused by his teacher from participating in a zoom call with classmates per wife’s request, and I expressed I didn’t think that was best for him long term. It turned into a huge argument and other points above were also brought up.

"AITA for making my girlfriends daughter move schools? | I’ve (38m) been dating my girlfriend (29f) for 5 years and we have recently decided to move in together. We’ve been wanting to move in together for a while, but between deployments and my girlfriend going to school it just hasn’t been a possibility until now. That being said we wanted to make everything official as fast as possible, so we’ve taken out a lease on a very nice house and will be completely moved in in the new year. 

Here comes the problem, my girlfriends daughter (14f) hates me and so of course she isn’t super happy about the move which is another reason we waited so long. However, her son (12m) is beyond excited, my girlfriends new job is closer to my work, and the area I’m moving them too (Coronado) is way nicer then where they were living before. Because of this move the kids will be starting new, and nicer schools. They even have specialized science lab programs that my gfs daughter has always talked about wanting.

I’ve tried explaining that isn’t the case, but she won’t budge, and is insisting we let her stay at her old school.

"AITA for 'airing dirty laundry' on Facebook? | I had an interesting childhood but for the sake of brevity: parents had an ugly divorce when I was under 2 years old. Their marriage was both their second marriage and they both had daughters from their previous marriages. After the ugly divorce, my father chose to stay out of my life to avoid the drama with my mother and focused instead on raising his daughter from his previous marriage. We did not communicate or see each other until I was 10 years old. 

My mother went to live with her ex-husband after she divorced my dad. I don't believe that they were romantically involved but they lived together again when I was young. I remember living in my sister's dad's (we will call him John) house for years. He treated me like a second daughter. After they moved apart again, on weekends when my sister would leave to visit her dad, I went too. I had my own room in his house, went on family vacations, visited his family events, attended the wedding of his new wife, played with his new sons after they were born, etc. They always felt like an extension of my own family. I could call them at any time, day or night, and if I needed something, they would do their best to help. After I turned 14, John and his family moved out of state but we kept in touch over the years. I visited and stayed with his family when I was a teenager and whenever they visited our home state, we would meet up for dinner and catch-up. 

My father and I are now quite close after almost 20 years of slowly re-building our relationship while I am not in contact with my mother at all. 

John passed away today from cancer. It was tragic and sad. The diagnosis came suddenly and his death followed very shortly after. I was only able to say goodbye through an email and couldn't even speak to him.

After I heard the news, I ended up posting to Facebook about my grief that he had passed. My sister had done the same. I stated that it was a weird relationship that we had but I loved him all the same. I said that he raised me and was a prominent father figure early on in my life even though in our later years we weren't in contact as much. 

My mother's family started posting their condolences and how he stepped up to raise me, how he was a second dad to me, and how he was a great man to take me on as his own. 

All of these posts have now led to my father contacting me via text to take the post down. He stated that it was attention-seeking.

"AITA for exposing a man as a fake veteran before his wedding? | I'm from New Zealand and i live in Ireland at the moment. One of my friends, Kathy, is Irish and had been dating another kiwi named John. John claimed to be a member of the New Zealand Royal navy. I knew he was a phony from the beginning, since i am a member myself i noticed him wearing the uniform incorrectly on social media and when i met him at a party he told me stuff that didn't make sense such as serving in units that would've been impossible with his occupation and time he claimed to have enlisted etc. I have told Kathy and her friends my concerns but they never believed me because he had photos of him with groups of other navy guys on ships. Im guessing either photoshop or maybe he had a bunch of other phonies dress up on a ship or something idk. 

I was able to get someone i knew in the service to search up his name and i found that he actually enlisted but was dishonorably discharged within a week of entering for bad conduct. Obviously this means he is not a lieutenant and should not have any uniforms. I get this information within a few weeks before his wedding. There's several legal ways to do this but i don't want to get into it for confidentiality.

  Kathy's brother emailed around 1600 making announcements for the wedding. This allowed me to get everyone's emails. I sent an email explaining all the discrepancies of his uniforms, stories he told, and finally proof submitting his discharge papers. Kathy decided to cancel the wedding and there was massive flame war that occurred, via email. I didn't even know that was possible but it happened. People went on saying how was a scumbag that should've minded my own business. Other people have told me that i should've told Kathy this privately but i feel everyone should've known that this man was a lying piece of shit. Kathy was initially angry but has now thanked me. I have gotten angry hate mail from John's family but I've ignored it

"AITA for filing multiple noise complaints on my neighbor because of the yelling of their intellectually disabled child? | I just recently upgraded from apartment living to a three bedroom duplex with my two children, wife and I. We have lived in apartments our entire adult lives.  Top floor, bottom floor, u name it, and we are used to and understanding of the noise. 

Moving to a duplex was a large step up for us. Each kid has their own room now! We have a garage! A backyard! We can grill! Also, it costs way more in rent then we have ever spent. But it seemed worth it, better school district and all that. 

Then real life set in and it hit hard. It’s almost like clock work, every night around 8-8:30ish the pounding and screaming starts. And it continued every night past 10:00 for quite awhile. 

About two weeks in it became ridiculous. My children were having a hard time falling asleep and it would go late enough that even my wife and I would have trouble going to sleep. One night it was exceptionally bad and my wife and I had had it! I knocked politely and the dad answered. 

I calmly explained to him that the noise was really loud, and that I wanted to have open communication with him because I’m sure they hear my kids at times too. He responded by saying, no, they never hear us and admitted it was all them. Then stated that one of their four children had autism and then nonchalantly jotted down my phone number and texted me for future use. 

Since then we haven’t heard anything past 10pm, (quiet hours are 10pm-8am) but every night there is pounding and screaming, every god damn night! And every god damn night my children have difficulty falling asleep! 

Since then we have filed multiple complaints with our rental agency, showing videos of even, of how loud it is and they don’t seem to care. They have done absolutely nothing. It’s so bad we are wanting to break our lease a month and a half in so we can, once again, have peace. 

Tonight it was a bit worse than usual and I texted the dad to ask if he would consider moving the loud child to a room that doesnt share a wall. I havnt heard back and I don’t expect to.

So he gets back from his walk and he only walks in with his mom's dog. He says 'other dog broke the harness and ran away, come help me find him.'

So I was freaking out at this point and asked, 'he ran away?' and he told me 'yes he's loose somewhere.' so I jumped up, ran and grabbed my shoes and sprinted out the door to find him. On my way out I asked the girlfriend to watch things while we go look.

"AITA for letting my friend sit on my lap? | Using fake names just in case anyone I know sees this.

I am dating Mary. Mary and I have been seeing each other since late June, but she is just now starting to hang out with me around friends and family. 

I also have a really good friend Jane I have know for a really long time. She is my younger sister's best friend, but she also is like a sister to me given how much time we've spent together over the years. Jane is really outgoing and friendly/affectionate.

This past weekend I had some people over to my place to hang out. In this group was Jane, Mary, my sister, and some other friends of mine or my sister. We were playing some games, and Jane wanted to partner up. No really a big deal. We partner up for a lot of games because we make a good team (usually we win). 

My living room is not huge by any means, and definitely isn't big enough to fit everyone at my place, so seating was cramped. Jane decided to sit on my lap. She has not done this before, but it's not unusual for her to be affectionate and friendly with her friends so I don't consider it weird (also because as I said she is basically family). 

My girlfriend was very testy all night, and later when I had a chance to talk to her she said it was because I let Jane sit on my lap. She feels like this is inappropriate and also doesn't like how touchy she can be with me, but I don't see the problem. Jane has always been this way. She doesn't mean anything by it.

"AITA for not attending family therapy? | My ex wife is extremely dramatic, overbearing and manipulative. She loves to have her way. She has primary custody of our 7 year old who she is convinced needs a therapist because he has been acting out in school. So she enrolled him with one who also does family therapy. 

That therapist has since diagnosed him with anxiety. 

I keep getting invites from my ex to go to their family therapy sessions. He does his own individually once a week. Family is once a month. I am refusing to go. One because the times are always super inconvenient.
They meet at his school (this is a school based therapy so he doesn’t miss school). Two because my wife is convinced that my lack of a good relationship with him is part of the issue. 

Together they have apparently and my son has separately told the therapist that I say mean things to him (I just don’t baby him) and that I never see him (not true). I admit I could spend more time with him but being able to always be there is hard. I make it when I can and I communicate with him when I can’t. 

A year ago she was feeling overwhelmed  after a “medical thing” (she claimed she almost died from cancer but it was really a simple surgery) and cried to me about taking him for a while. I couldn’t. She threatened to drop him off at my parents and run away.  She has since claimed to have worked through it with her own therapist and talked through it with our son apologizing for “mommy having a tough time”. 

I asked the therapist on the phone if my son talked about me and she said “Yes, sometimes” Then she asked me to come in for the next session but I was working that day. 


I think a huge issue is her having tried to abandon him and generally just being who she is which is an awful person and my son picks up on that. 

I have told her flat out I am not going to those appointments. I have ignored the emails from the therapist. 

I am walking into a room already primed to consider me at fault and I don’t think I need to be there for that. Why? So she can say “see who agrees with me” and be smug about it. 

She said she talked to a lawyer and she could take it to court to get it ordered and I told her to go ahead but I will fight to choose the therapist, not someone already on her side. I am sure she has bought all my exes lies and my son’s exaggerations that are fed and created by my ex.

"AITA for telling my mom I’d rather eat a frozen meal than her thanksgiving dinner? | I’ll try to keep this short. I don’t eat meat or dairy due to personal reasons.

I don’t feel that it’s morally wrong to consume these products and I don’t have any superiority complex involving my diet. If someone specifically asks me about the motives behind my dietary choices, I will answer them, but I don’t go out of my way to bring it up. 

I live with my parents so they are well aware of my diet. 

Anyway, last week my mom started discussing the thanksgiving menu. She said she planned to make a roast turkey, sausage stuffing, mashed potatoes (butter/milk) and then asked me if I would make some sides as well. I told her sure, I guess I could roast some vegetables alongside some meatless chicken tenders in the oven. She got really offended and said “really? You’re going to sit at thanksgiving dinner with a frozen meal and a chip on your shoulder?” I was kind of taken off guard because my mom is more than used to me cooking dinner for myself. I typically cook with a lot whole Foods and make more elaborate salads, stews, pasta dishes, etc. but since my mom is going to be cooking all day I just figured I’d keep it simple. 

I eventually asked her, point blank, what exactly she wanted me to do. Did she want me to eat her roast turkey? Because that’s not something I want to do. She said no, she didn’t expect that, but I could at least put the effort into making myself a presentable meal for thanksgiving. 

Personally I feel she’s asking a lot considering she’s not actually helping to accommodate my dietary habits (not that I’d expect her to. But I feel I should get free reign since she isn’t).

We've interviewed someone who is perfect for the job, I've actually worked with him before and he's great, ideal for the job and our future plans. He would bring skills and knowledge to our business that would be extremely beneficial. However, I have since discovered that he is engaged to a very unsavoury lady (how or why, baffles me).


Based on this, I dont want to hire him.


She has actually physically attacked me in the past with a bottle (at random), to the point I was actually pressing charges against her (which were eventually dropped by myself), it affected me so much that I didn't want to go out in my home town for several months. Another friend of mine has had a similar experience with her too so it's not an isolated event. She's violent and unpredictable. I still have a scar on the back of my head from the attack.


The culture of our company involves partners quite regularly for lunches, dinners, weekend retreats etc so avoiding her would be impossible and quite frankly I dont want anything to do with this person, ever. 


Ultimately, I'm responsible for day to day management and the final decision is my call, but my partners feel I'm being unreasonable and I should let bygones be bygones for the sake of the business, but I'm threatened and intimidated by this individual and being the co owner of this business, I dont think I should put myself in that situation.

"AITA for ""taking"" a disabled students seat? | I'm currently taking a class at my local college.  The class is MWF but last Monday was a holiday so the first day of class was last Wednesday.  I attended the first day of class but it was packed so I had to stand in the back.  Then I missed the Friday lecture as well as the Monday lecture.  Today, Wednesday, was my 1st day back. I knew the class was packed so I came 10 min early to get a seat in the front row.  I prefer to sit in the front row because I have anxiety.  By sitting in the front I'm able to ask questions/answer questions without being forced to shout it across the room.  I'm perfectly capable of doing well in a course if I'm forced to sit in the back...this is just a strong preference.

All seats are first come, first served.  There are 2 seats in each class called ""priority seats"" specifically designated for the disabled that are only open to abled students when they're unoccupied.  You have to notify the school, then the professor makes sure that seat is available to you every lecture. For the abled seats, after a few weeks people always tend to sit in the same seats and you get the impression that its your ""seat"" that you sit in for the rest of the semester even though its technically not.  After I sit down I notice 2 girls walk in together talking and laughing.  One girl sits in the seat behind me and the other girl stands next to me and says:

Girl 1: Hi, sorry, actually you're sitting in my seat.

Me: There is no assigned seating.  Anyone can sit anywhere.

Girl 1: Yeah but I've been sitting in this seat all semester (this is our 3rd lecture out of like 30). There are still open seats in the back that you can move to.

Me: Which means there are also open seats in the back that you can sit in too, right?

Girl 1: Look...I'm deaf in 1 ear. I need a seat in the front row.  Move please. (I saw her hearing aid)

Me: Then you'd be registered with the disabled students department and they would have made sure you had priority seating. This isn't a priority seat.

Girl 1: I don't need to register anything with the school and I dont need to explain myself to you.  Its my seat...I told you I need it because I'm hard of hearing.

Me: Wouldn't those same rules apply to me as well? Not needing to explain myself to you?

Girl 2: Stop being an asshole and just fucking move...jesus.

Me: I'm done talking. I'm not moving.

Girl 1 and Girl 2: \*\*scoffs\*\*

Girl 1: \*\*finds another seat\*\*

I don't feel like I did anything wrong, but I damn sure spent the rest of class overhearing everyone behind me talking shit about me.

"AITA for moving out to live with my aunts? | I am fifteen. Five years ago, my parents died in car accident and since then, I’ve been living with my grandparents (my mom’s parents). I am very thankful I was able to live with them. I love them dearly and we are quite close.

Over the summer, I spent a month with my aunts (my dad’s sisters). When my parents died, they wanted to take me in, but I ended up living with my grandparents instead. My aunts still visited me a lot, and I visited them a lot, but this summer was the first time I stayed with them for a month straight. 

I did a lot of stuff while visiting my aunts. One of them gave me a job at her bakery, and I loved helping and earning money. They taught me to drive, which my grandparents said I couldn’t do until I turn 18. I also started dating a guy who will be going to the local high school. I visited the high school and I loved it, it was so much bigger than the tiny school I went to last year near my grandparents, with a lot more class options and AP courses and extracurriculars. I also felt like I got to know my aunts a lot better, and they told me a lot of stories about my dad which I never knew before. 

My aunts always told me that their door is always open for me, and that I’m welcome any time. I told them that I wanted to move in with them, and they were thrilled. Then I told my grandparents and they were not thrilled, they seemed really upset. I didn’t really think about what it would mean for them if I moved out. I honestly thought it would just take off a burden from them, I didn’t think they would react as sadly as they did, and I feel awful for not even talking it over with them first, just telling them I want to move out, and thinking harder about it, I’m seeing that some of the reasons I wanted to move are kind of stupid. 

I’m worried that my grandparents feel threatened by my aunts or something. Since they’re from different sides, they don’t really know each other, I’m the only connection.

My husband and I have two children together. He also has a daughter from a previous relationship that is 15 (less than a month younger than my daughter) let’s call her Jane. 

When my ex-husband and I divorced, he was in law school. He is now a lawyer and does very well for himself. 

Alice was not doing well in school during her freshman year. She and her father struck up a deal that if she made all As he would give her an increase in her allowance. 

She made all As in the first semester. Her father increased her allowance from $65 a week to *$250* a week. He and I had an argument about this. I think it is entirely too much money. I can’t afford to give Jane the same treatment. I caved and told her that she was required to save some of it each week. 

Alice has had the allowance for about two months, and she is starting to buy very expensive items. It is making Jane resentful. The latest thing she wanted to buy was an Apple Watch. Jane has been asking for one for several months, I told her that I couldn’t afford it but would get her a Fitbit. 

When Alice told me she was going to buy the Apple Watch, I told her that it wouldn’t be fair to her sister. I told her she could buy a Fitbit like the one I was giving Jane, but the Apple Watch was off the table. 

She got very upset with me and ran to tell her father. He and I have been arguing for a couple of days. I have actually doubled down since then and told her that she can’t buy any items that I deem too expensive. If she does she must leave them at her fathers house. 

She is refusing to talk to me or her sister, and I’m starting to feel bad but still think that Alice is getting unfair treatment. Am I in the wrong here? Am I being an asshole?",wrong,commonsense,ethics_312

"AITA for not getting my partner a Christmas gift after being told no gifts? | I'm copping flak for not buying a Christmas gift despite explicitly being told ""no buying Christmas gifts this year"". What I did do was borrow a friend's old fashioned pen (wood with metal tip) and ink bottle and try to write a letter with a bit of flair (I did traditional calligraphy back in school, but it's rusty now). I saw a letter as not disturbing the spirit of ""no gift"" agreement. 

On Christmas I gave the letter and what I received were gifts of substantial value (after currency conversion ≈ $180USD). There was much disappointment on her end as I didn't buy a gift and a letter was seen as a ""cop out"". I felt very awkward as I thought the agreement was no gifts. I tried to say return the gifts as we agreed

There's been some tensions about this and discussions that I should have understood that ""no gifts"" really means ""yes, gifts"". Some friends and family have told me that I have to learn when no means yes. I'm getting told a ""no"" is contextual by my significant other, however I find this stupid. My main argument back was that the definition of ""no"" has to be consistent otherwise the word loses its meaning.

However now there's this passive aggressive spat going one that I constantly seem to be the bad guy in. Anytime I ask ""do you want me to do X household thing? (iron her clothes, take out garbage when half-filled, etc.)"" I get told ""no"", then when I don't do it I cop flak because I should have taken it as a ""yes"".

I don't know. I don't really feel like the ""arsehole"" here, but family and friends' comments seem to indicate I am. I guess perception is reality and I might actually be the arsehole to them. But, I will still refuse to accept that ""no gifts"" can ever mean ""yes, gifts"".",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_317

Well last night my girlfriend asked me to stay in bed with her and just watch movies while cuddling. And I said no, told her I don't want to get sick and went to watch movies is in the living room. Now she's angry at me and calling me an asshole for not comforting her or nurturing her while she's sick.

"AITA for accepting payment for babysitting when I leave the kid alone? | I'm a student, and I work for an online tutoring service, where I get paid by the appointment (£10 per 30 minutes).

Students can request a 30 or 60 minute session. I put all my clients who want 30 minutes during weekdays, and I time the appointments so I have a 30 minute session, then a 30 minute break.

My sister wanted me to babysit my niece (11). This includes food, homework help, and generally making sure she has what she needs. We don't have any other family who can look after her and her dad isn't involved.

My sister wanted me to watch my niece on Tues-Thurs, for 4 or 5 hours at a time, from 3 until 7 or 8. She offered £5 an hour, and she's paid every time.

Weeks 1-3: I cancelled all sessions to watch Niece, and lost a lot of money.

Week 4: my sister told me that she didn't need me, so I kept all my appointments. Then around 1pm on Tuesday she texted that she did need my help tonight. I couldn't cancel - too short notice. I sat my niece down with dinner and homework and left her to it while I did 2 sessions on Tuesday and 4 on Wednesday. I cancelled Thursday. I apologised to my niece for leaving her on her own, and she said she was capable of taking care of herself, and that if I had any more appointments to be in then she would be alright on her own while I had them, as they're not very long.

Weeks 5-now: I haven't cancelled any. This means that of the 4 or 5 hours my niece is with me, she's alone for around half of the total time. I am always in the next room, and she can come and get me if she needs me. I've used my breaks (30 minutes every hour) to check in.

In this time I've also kept taking the £5 an hour from my sister. I usually end up spending whatever she gives me on my niece, whether that's in the form of buying food that she likes, bus fare, or whatever other expenses come with looking after her.

Last night my sister arrived half hour early, while I was on a session, and my niece told her I was on the laptop in the next room, and explained the whole setup.

My sister comes in while I am with a new client, and starts yelling at me. She says that she has asked me to watch my niece, and I am being paid to take care of her, and that I should have told her that Niece was unattended for half the time she was with me.

It was never a secret, and when my sister has previously asked what we did, I have said that I had a client, or clients, and she's never blinked twice on hearing the information.

My sister is now asking that I give back all the money she's given me for babysitting. This total is between £360-450. I no longer have this money as and I have no proper total of how much due to it being a mix of cash and online bank transactions.

I think my sister is overreacting, and I'm not just going to give her a few hundred and hope it's the right amount, but my sister clearly expected me to be with niece the whole time, so she's not getting what she paid for. AITA?",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_324

"AITA if I sell a “family relic” that is rightfully mine. | My grandfather was from Italy and he had a saber that was pass from his family. Apparently is very old. My grandpa died a many years ago and he left one of her houses to me, and in that house the saber was exhibit.Now I did some research and I apparently can make good many selling it so I decided to do it.

 So the other day we were at my mother house in a family reunion, with all of my family including my cousin wich is a very history nerd ( likes history, has a lot of flags in his house and even does fencing ). I comment the fact I was going to sell grandpa’s saber and he instantly got mad. Now when my grandfather died he ask me if the saber was in the house, apparently grandpa had “promised” to let her have it to “keep the tradition”, I told him that I didn’t have it ( I did have it but I didn’t want him to have something that was rightfully mine, after all it was in my house ) but he didn’t believe me so he visited my house and I hide it. When he heard that i actually have it he demanded that I gave it to him, I’m totally not going to do it, I prefer gaining some money that keeping a tradition that’s probably fake.

"AITA for commenting on how much my daughter had eaten? | My 20 year old daughter arrived home after a day of work just after 6. She cooks her own meals because she eats a vegan diet and we (her parents/my husband and I) do not. She usually reheats a dinner/cooks alongside me in the kitchen to make her own meal which works well. 

She commented once about how hungry she was and looking forward to dinner and at about 7 we sat down. She was having a bean and vegetable soup she’d made a few days before and portioned out into servings and toast and we were having a different meal. After we finished, I jokingly lifted up her empty bowl and said “Well YOU must have been hungry, didn’t leave a thing!” And she looked at me a little annoyed and said well I worked all day and it was just a single bowl of soup and toast. I said yes but you ate alllll of it. She just said she doesn’t comment on how much we eat and it made her feel awkward because she didn’t really know how to respond. She then asked me if I would’ve said that to her father or brother had they eaten the amount she’d just eaten. I honestly said no but that’s because they probably would’ve eaten even a bit more being grown men.

"AITA for asking my girlfriend to not talk to me about her autism partners support group? | I'm in a long distance relationship for now. There's been some tension and my girlfriend has been thinking I'm on the spectrum for awhile. I've never been diagnosed with autism. At one point she contacted my mother and brother without telling me to ask them about if I showed signs of it growing up. She wants me to get formally tested but upon looking into that's very difficult and expensive for an adult.

She joined a Facebook group for women with autistic boyfriends or husbands. The group seems to not act as a support group even if that's what it is in theory, but rather a place for women to vent about their autistic partners, or often just ex-partners of them venting about how awful they are. A lot of stuff she's shown me from it seems pretty bigoted, talking about how autistic people are basically sociopaths, how they can never understand emotions and never avoid from hurting people. She regularly shows me posts on it that ""remind her of me"" and sends me screenshots, often with her often hurtful comments about me intact. She asked on it if they thought I was on the spectrum and then showed me the responses. Her post was very one-sided in the description. The comments were very hurtful, most telling her to leave me, and about how I was obviously autistic and would never change. I told her how this hurts me and she just says that I need to address this even if it hurts because it could kill the relationship otherwise.

Whenever we discuss it we mostly go in circles. I pledge to change behaviors she dislikes and she shares stories from it as ""proof"" I might not be able to change and says it's important to talk about it because I need to be prepared if she decides to just walk away from the relationship as a result. I've actually gotten some books and resources to read about the issues with the relationship but sometimes don't get time to read them because we have a long drawn out conversation about something she read on there, usually a topic we've already discussed.

We once were having a discussion about boundaries. I asked if I could set some boundaries and one was not discussing that group with me. She got infuriated and went on a tirade against me, claiming my requests were ""rules, not boundaries"" and the only reason she shared that and other actions was ""a reaction to my bullshit"" so I had no right to complain about it, and how he she relies on that group for support because of my behavior so it's all ultimately my fault. She also regularly reminds me about how she might have to ""walk away from the relationship"" and how I shouldn't be bothered or offended if she does. I've told her that it's still a hurtful thing to constantly discuss if she wants to remain in it for now, which she insists she does, and is taxing on my emotional health and making it difficult to make the changes she wants.

"AITA for finding it difficult to bond with my stepdaughter? | I'm a mother of six kids, one of those kids being my stepdaughter S. Just to get straight into it, my stepdaughter is the product of an affair. My husband had an affair right after our second child was born, and he got her pregnant. It was a traumatic birth, our second was a fussy baby, and we had two kids under two. When I found out my husband had an affair, it absolutely destroyed me. 

Things only got worse after S was born. Her mother passed away when she was just a year old, leaving my husband and I with full custody of her. It's been 15 years, and I've tried as best as I can to make it work. She has not been an easy child from the start; she constantly threw tantrums, got into fights at school and with me, and still acts out now as a teenager. I wish I could say that I love her in spite of it all, but I don't know how to feel about her a majority of the time. 

Last night, at dinner, one of my younger daughters L and I were talking about an upcoming competition (she's part of a dance competition team) and working out the dates I'd likely have to take off because of it. S made a kind of snippy remark about how it was funny that I'd told her I couldn't take off work for one of her school sports events, even though she'd asked me to since her father couldn't either, but I could go to L's no problem. I told her I couldn't, because I was genuinely busy around that time, but I'd have to be there for L's event. 

S starts off on yelling at me, saying that I don't care about her, and we ended up getting into another argument. Typical teenager stuff, she told me that she hates me, but she's going to get over it. My husband doesn't seem to think so, though. He accused me of openly favoring our children, and reminded me that S is my daughter too. I told him I'm trying the best I can given the fact that I have to be reminded that he cheated every single day. S overheard that, and is now refusing to talk to me, but it's the honest truth. 

I know it is not S's fault, and I want to be there for her and have a good mother-daughter relationship, but it isn't easy when your child looks exactly like the woman your husband cheated on you with. No matter what I do, it just feels impossible to bond with her, even though I want to. AITA?",wrong,commonsense,ethics_330

"AITA for taking food off my friend's plate without asking first? | A group of us (all girls) went out for dinner.  I sat next to a cool girl I've known for about six months who's pretty playful but with sarcastic side to her. I do enjoy her company after getting to know her better.

I am a pescatarian and I ordered the prawn dish. It was huge and I invited everyone to have a piece.  She declined and continued on with her chicken plate.  She never offered me any of her plate, which I thought was weird since I offered her my plate.

This girl is tiny and I noticed she had two untouched plantains she hadn't eaten along with some rice and bits of chicken that she had partitioned into sections on her plate.  It really looked like she was done with her meal.  I announce to the table, ""Okay, I can't stand this anymore,"" and I reached over and I stabbed her plantain with my fork and shoved it into my mouth.   The entire table was silent and watching me chew and I felt so awkward right after I did it.  She looked at me with daggers in her eyes and put her fork and knife down and said, ""You know, I really hate when people eat off my plate.""  

I tried to make a joke out of it and lighten the mood by making kissy noises, but she wouldn't have any of it.  She looked disgusted with one eyebrow raised shaking her head, and made more snide comments, like she was really irritated with what I did.  While I never apologized to her, I didn't think my action warranted her strong reaction, especially since I was open to sharing my food with her.

When it was time to leave the restaurant, she boxed up her uneaten food and the one remaining plantain in a doggy bag.  Weird.  Why wouldn't she lighten up since she wasn't eating it anyway?

Later on that same evening, we all went out to get ice cream and everyone was discussing what flavors they were going to get.  She already ordered and was eating, so I was going to ask her what flavors she got, but before I could say anything, she moved away from me and said, ""Don't touch my ice cream.""

Before going on the trip, my girlfriend told me that Haley, who is one of her friends going on the trip, is the girl that humiliated her once in the PE locker room and once during high school volleyball practice. She told me about the stories before but not the girl’s name. I asked her why Haley did those things to her and she said Haley was jealous of her looks, her popularity, and the fact that she always got it her way. 


My girlfriend said they aren’t the best of friends, but Haley has sincerely apologized for her actions and has told my girlfriend the reasons she humiliated her was out of jealousy, but that she has found self-love and wasn’t jealous of anyone anymore. My girlfriend also said Haley only seemed to take her jealous rage out at her and not anybody else. 


The other four people met up at my girlfriend’s house and we drove up to the ski resort. Haley seemed like a chill girl. On the ride there, I asked her about how she met my girlfriend and what it was like being volleyball teammates with her. She brought up the volleyball incidence herself, said she was deeply repentent about it, and asked me if my girlfriend ever told me about it.

Haley once again apologized to my girlfriend for treating her like shit. My girlfriend told her she already forgave her years ago and begged Haley to stop beating herself up about it.

"AITA for being unhappy with a birthday present and confronting my family about it? | I know it sounds kinda stupid and petty and it is.

Today is my birthday and because I'm a minor I still live with my family. My parents always give me and my brother money for our birthdays so we can save and get something we really want. They will also give the other sibling money ahead of time so my brother and I can get each other small gifts. 

This morning I got a ton of birthday calls from family and a gift from my brother. He looked quite apprehensive about giving it to me and quietly explained he wasn't happy with the gift and didn't think I'd like it. It was a necklace that isn't the sort of thing I'd particularly like at all. In front of everyone I acted like I liked it but later on the way to school I talked to my brother about it. Turns out it was supposed to go to my brother's gf but they broke up so our mum made him give it to me instead even though everyone knew it'd be the sort of thing I'd hate. 

I messaged my mum letting her know I knew about this situation. I politely told her I was unhappy with the gift and I would prefer if it was given to someone else or returned and that my brother gets me a birthday present by himself. I made sure my message was a polite as it could be and that I didn't sound accusatory because I didn't want to start a fight over a bad gift. Well, that's kinda what happened. My mum messaged back defensive and annoyed because from her perspective it was a beautiful necklace that would go nicely with my dress for going out (it wouldn't at all for a plethora of reasons), it was more expensive than the allocated amount so I should be grateful, and it was bought overseas so they have no way to return it.

Now, I had no clue about the last few things. I just knew it was a necklace that was supposed to go to someone else and my brother tried to convince my mum I'd hate it and he should get me a gift in the price range that I'd like. My mum thinks I knew about the whole context and was being a spoilt brat about it all. Even though I didn't know about everything, I still kind of feel like TA for confronting my mum about a birthday gift I didn't pay for that cost more than normal and can't be returned but on the other hand I feel like my family (excluding my awesome brother) was being TA for forcing my brother to give me a gift I wouldn't like instead of letting him get me something himself.

"WIBTA If I brought up something that I know embarrasses my gf because she isn't following through? | A little over 2 months ago gf and I were hanging out at my apt drinking and she got beyond shitfaced.  She passed out hard and I went to bed soon after.  I woke up in the middle of the night and my ass and legs are soaked.  I jump out of bed and turn the light on and she didn't stir at all, she had pissed the bed.  I was able to get her up and get the blankets and sheets off and replace them with a couple extra comforters, but it was still nasty.

I could tell she was really embarrassed the next day and she kinda just bounced before I could say anything about it.  I figured she was pretty hung over so I'd give her some recovery time before I brought it up.  

The issue is I'm not working right now, I'm on disability.  I scrape by and replacing my mattress would take months and months of saving every extra cent.  She lives with her parents and works part time.  She has no bills.  I really feel like she should replace the mattress.

I tried being as understanding and non judgmental about it as possible.  These things happen, at the same time I need a new mattress.  I told her I was fine with the cheapest option she could find that would fit the box spring.  She was just kinda quiet and agreed to replace it. 

After about a month of sleeping on a bed that still reeks (febreeze and bleach have done almost nothing) I asked her if she's been able to save up enough to get the mattress soon.  She blew up at me and told me she said she'll buy one and that's what she's going to do, but I need to stop bringing up because it's humiliating.   I get that and I backed off on it.

Well it's over two months now and yesterday I saw on her fb selfies from the salon she goes to.  I know she spends well over $100 each trip there because one time she ""jokingly"" told me I should pay for her salon trips because she does it for me.  The only furniture I have in my apt is a couple folding chairs and my bed.  So I can't even sleep on a couch and wait for her to replace it.  It's gross.

I don't want to embarrass her, but I'm sick of having to smell it.  I feel like she's just ignoring the situation I'm pretty irked that she'd treat herself to an expensive salon visit and show it off on fb, while I'm still living with her piss smell every night. 

I know I agreed not to bring it up again, but she's not following through and I feel like she's not going to unless I push the issue again.",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_345

"AITA if I tell my parents they’re the reason my brother acts so entitled. | TL;DR at the bottom

So for background:
I (18F) and my brother (16M) are 18 months apart in age as a result I have no memories were he isn’t present, some of my earliest are of him throwing huge tantrums in public places like shops, parks, beaches over the smallest things and not being punished but seemingly rewarded.

The clearest one I remember is when we were at a fair at a beach in the middle of summer when I was 8 and my brother was a few months of 7, it was some time in the afternoon we walked passed several booths selling BB guns (realistic looking ones not the obviously fake ones). We were trying to find the food booth to get drinks and a snake, my brother saw the BB guns and immediately declared “I want that” and pointed to the BB that looked like a rifle.

Mums first response was no as was dads, this caused my brother to not only cry but to scream that the top of his lungs in the middle of the street while declaring that our parents are cruel, nasty, selfish, cheap and that he would be better of living with strangers than our parents because then the people he lived with would care about him and love him. My parents stood there for about 5 maybe 10 minutes while this was happening and then my mum chucked her purse at my dad and told him to go buy the BB my brother had pointed at, it was over £40 (I don’t remember the exact price he broke it the same week). We then had to go home immediately and my parents were angry the rest of the day and the rest of the week.

Present:
My brother now expects everything to be done for him, even the simplest things like getting a drink or cleaning his room and if it isn’t done the exact minute he asks he will shout and bang his things on the floor before yelling that no one loves him or respects him. He demands money from our parents constantly for stuff on his xbox, sometimes £40 to £60 pounds twice a week and then throws a fit when he’s told we can’t afford it, he will then proceed to demand my parents put of paying a bill or demand they take out a loan to give him the money. He truly believes that what he wants should come before us being able to keep a roof over our heads.

My parents are seriously worried about his entitled behaviour and how he doesn’t seem able to grasp the concept of working for money or paying bills to live somewhere. They’re now wondering how he could have grown up to behave like this and don’t seem able to see that it could be there fault.

So AITA if I bluntly tell them that it’s their fault my brother is like this.

TL;DR- my parents made my brother entitled by being enablers and are now confused about why he is entitled.",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_347

"WIBTA - for asking my friend to pay for ‘my’ speeding ticket? | I got a $400 speeding ticket from DC in the mail today. When I checked the date and time on the ticket, it was from the day my friend was driving my car.

-I asked him to drive because I was feeling too tired 
-I was in the front passenger seat but not paying attention to the speed limit signs
-We could have easily taken his car but my car has better air conditioning and ‘is fun to drive’ (his words)
-Clocked at 64 mph in a 40 mph Work Zone

In general I think he is a good driver which is why I trusted him to drive my car and he was doing me favor by driving. I don’t think it would have happened if we took his car (my car is easier to speed in) or if I drove.

I understand ultimately I’m responsible for the ticket because it’s my car. But I feel since he was driving he should carry some or all of this price. 

Would I be the asshole for asking him to pay the entire ticket of $400? Or if I asked him to split it?",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_351

This is pretty common and the two friends would've almost certainly seen me do this before. He agreed so I pushed my plate over to him. 

One of the friends said ""well, *I'd* like some too"" in a pissed off tone and started helping herself to my leftovers. The other friend said ""yeah, me too"" and took a piece of food from my plate as well. My boyfriend didn't say anything so neither did I, but the tone struck me as somewhat rude.

"AITA for studying in a space I just realized was probably for prayer? | So, theres this building in my uni with a basement area that no one uses in the weekend. I like to study there because its quite, however recently, I found a semi-hidden room. It had a bunch of couches, bookshelves, desks and a chair. Basically, it looked like a standard student lounge, so I elected to study there because its less creepy than the basement. There were a few signs saying ""Quiet please, this lounge is being transformed into an area for prayer, meditation and relaxation"", but seeing as how I was literally the only one there and I was just quietly studying, I thought I would be fine. After an hour, a guy came in with a prayer mat and started praying. I was as quiet as possible, and didn't acknowledge it but I feel like it made him uncomfortable as he kinda peeked in the room and walked out before hand. I thought it would be worse if I straight up bailed as soon as he started praying, so I kinda just chilled there and continued to review my flashcards. I wasn't in front of him or anything either. But I still feel like kind of a dick for encroaching in his prayer, especially since specific prayer rooms dont exist in our uni. This is also the second time this has happened to me, and one of my friends called me a slight asshole the first time for not leaving when someone came in to pray. (This was a diffrent senario though. The first time was when I was having a slight mental break down and ran off to one of the more hidden rooms in my uni building, and some guy started praying while I was low-key crying. I still dont think I was in the wrong that time, as this was not a designated area and I was there first. But I'm not so sure about this time.)",wrong,commonsense,ethics_361

Also I live in the Netherlands so legality is not a problem.

Recently i've been getting texts from my upstairs neighbours, about their house smelling like weed and this bothering them. They also have a son who is (i think) about 9-10 years old. I do my best to make sure the smell doesn't bother them (Keeping my window closed despite the rather tropical temperatures lately, for example) but sometimes it gets through, i guess. They've asked me why i can't just go outside and smoke, the thing is i really enjoy my moment of coming home from work (physical labor, + 1 hour of commute on my bicycle, so when i get home i'm usually pretty beat), sitting back in my chair, grabbing a drink and having a smoke.

"AITA for refusing to spend Easter with my parents, because my mother keeps feeding my dog human food despite me clearly forbidding it? | About a year ago me and my SO adopted a stray dog. She's still quite fearful, but getting better every day. Because she used to be a stray, her teeth, digestive system and coat were in a poor shape. We managed to make it better through hard work and a light diet. Our vet told us that as a stray she probably ate a lot of trash and scraps of salty human meals, so we should be even more careful with feeding her processed human foods than usual. If we want to treat her, we boil some (safe) vegetables, give her a few slices of an apple or a spoonful of sugar-free yoghurt, but spicy and salty processed sausages or ham are off limits. So are heavy cheeses, sugary puddings and other sweets, fast food and so on.

As a part of her socialization process, we visit my parents quite often. It's great and I've always been grateful for them inviting us. However, last time we visited, my mother was in quite a mood for the entire time and actively tried to annoy me multiple times. Most of them I'd endure without batting an eye, but one thing that led to an actual fight was the fact, that she fed my dog human food, mostly pizza crust with spices and sprinkles of cheese on it **while looking me dead in the eye** **right after actually** **asking me if she can feed the dog and me saying no**.

Since at this point I already told her multiple times that this is not acceptable, I asked her why is she even asking me if she can feed the dog if she's gonna do it anyway. She answered ""because I don't agree with you"". It was a very stupid answer, so I asked does that mean she doesn't want us coming the her house, because it kind of looks like she wants to scare us out. She then said that she ""won't be blackmailed"" by me and she will ""do whatever she wants and if we don't want to visit, we don't have to"", so I answered that since I am not looking forward to watching the dog's every move and I think she poses a threat to her health, we won't be visiting for Easter or any time soon for that matter, to which she just barked ""fine"" like a moody teenager and me and my SO left.

I do not intend to set foot in that house until I hear a clear apology and she swears that she won't feed the dog shit again. Now I'm finding out that she's deeply offended, because I supposedly set restrictions on her *and her alone* out of spite and ""if I think I will win this peeing contest I am dead wrong"". On top of it I know this whole situation ruined Easter for my SO, because we refused to visit his mother to make plans with my parents. My dad is also sad, because we're not coming.

Needless to say, I was excited and when my sister mentioned she wanted one for my niece for her birthday, I told her I would try. At the store I was told they had no extra and the store closest was about an hour away. So I asked if they had a new switch and they told me that only had used. So,  I got her a used one,  accessories and a case and went home. 

I brought the gifts over to their house that night and my niece, a 16 year old girl looked visibly upset at seeing that it was just a plain console. She said thanks and that was it.

"AITA for interviewing for the same position my aunt did. The same aunt who helped get me into the company? | I never thought I'd be posting on this sub but I'm really conflicted about this. TLDR at the bottom. 

My aunt got me into the company we both work for and we are currently in the same position. There is only one way for us to grow in our company and as such we talked about how we both wanted to eventually move up and I even flat out asked her if she was going to be ok if I applied for any promotions and she said that it was fine. Well the time came sooner than either of us anticipated when we both got a call yesterday from our manager to notify us that a position unexpectedly opened and they would be having interviews today and making a decision tomorrow. I was ecstatic and immediately called her with the news and that's when everything changed. She didn't know I was getting interviewed too and she was acting really off. I could tell she wasn't happy and eventually after 10 mins of beating around the bush I flat out asked her if she was upset I was being interviewed. And that's when she told me that she would quit if I got promoted before her. Not that she would quit if she didn't get promoted... only if I got promoted before her. So if somebody else got the job it was fine.  I asked her if she wanted me to rescind my acceptance for the interview and she said no but it was all really passive aggressive for the rest of the conversation before it was finally so awkward that I got off the phone. 

We had interviews today and I wished her luck and I told her I would be happy if either one of us got the job. And I called her after our interviews  to see how it went for her and we both felt good about it. However, she kept asking me questions to get info on my interview but was really secretive and wouldn't answer my questions... 

I love my aunt but I really want this job. But half of me wants for her to get it just so that I dont have to keep worrying about us having to compete  every time a similar position opens. 

So AITA? Part of me thinks so because she helped get me the job and she's my aunt and my elder but I'm conflicted because I SPECIFICALLY asked her before this promotion even came up if she would be ok if I went after promotions and she said yes! 

TLDR: Aunt and I both interviewed for the same promotion. She helped me get into the company in the first place. I asked her if she was ok with me applying for promotions and she initially said yes but now that it's actually come up she says she will quit if I get the job before her.

"WIBTA for having a celebration for being sterilised? | I am a 28yo female. I suffer from an anxiety disorder which is massively amplified by birth control - I get week long anxiety spirals pretty much every other week followed by periods of depression over the things I’ve just been anxious about that haven’t even happened. The only time in the last 8 years or so that I’ve felt okay was when I came off birth control a couple of years ago to see how I felt and I felt fantastic, however I got stressed at the thought of accidentally getting pregnant and went back on it and I am really struggling again. 

I don’t want kids - never have, never will - and my boyfriend of 10 years feels the same. Family often tell me I’ll “change my mind” but I see it the same way as people who know they want kids eventually - you just know. I have been saving up money to pay to get sterilised and I still need to finish saving and then start the whole process which will probably take a while but I’m really excited. It will stop me getting pregnant and I can come off birth control for the sake of my mental health. 

People who know about this have asked me if I’m sure, what if I change my mind, and told me what a big decision it is. I know it’s a big decision but I don’t think it’s any bigger than the decision to have a child and it’s something I’ve been thinking about for years. 

Some of my friends have been really supportive and know how badly I want this operation so they have asked if they can throw me a “non-baby shower” to celebrate when I have had it done.

This evening, we were celebrating thanksgiving as part of the family will be out traveling during then. Then out came a comment referencing a girl in his (Gary) friend group, stating that if the said friend wasn’t dating so and so(Gary’s friend), it would have been Gary she ended up with. Then proceeded to make comments about how Gary felt about said friend back then. (We’ve been together 5 years) Gary had to awkwardly make his way through the conversation. 
I got upset over it tonight, I did not think that I was appropriate conversation to bring to the table, especially during our thanksgiving dinner. 
There are many more examples than the two or three minimal ones stated in this post, and I’ve dealt with them all with a chuckle when it’s a joke and I just generally go along with the conversation when it’s something deeper, such as showing me the childhood fling thing. 
I trust Gary, and I love Gary and I’m not generally an overtly jealous person, although I am a human being. I just felt sort of disrespected at the table and I expressed it to my boyfriend who has stated that that’s just how SD is.

My wife and I bought a house with this nice big yard. When we bought it didn’t have a fence or wall around it at all. We wanted to build a tall totally enclosed wall all around our yard to have more privacy and make it safer yard for our dogs.

We only have one house right next to us. An older couple lives there. We were going to talk to them about building the wall, but they never seemed to be home. We learned from a neighbor across the street that they had gone to deal with a family issue. They didn’t know when they would be back and didn’t have any contact information.

After a month though they still weren’t back so we decided to go through with building the wall. We checked the city restrictions and decided to get someone to check the property lines again just in case and built our wall next to our neighbors three foot wall that surrounded their property. We figured they would want to keep their wall as is because they have built in flower beds.

Our neighbors came back today, about 2-3 weeks after the wall was built. We went and chatted with them for a while they were unloading their bags and everything seemed friendly. Then we left to go out for lunch and a movie.

When we got back home around 5 our neighbor came over and knocked on our door. I was in the shower at this time so I’ll let my wife relay what he said.

Basically he said we were very inconsiderate to build our wall without even asking them.

If that didn't work, she would pursue another more predictably successful career. She agreed and kept track of hours spent on comedy.

"AITA for not giving my ex ""the baby stuff""? | My ex and I split about 4 years ago, when our child was nearly 2. I kept all the baby items from the baby shower: clothes, bottles, crib, etc- aside from things with sentimental value to ex (some clothes blankets, toys), as I had primary custody of our child together. I have since remarried and have a 7 month old, and ex is expecting a child with a new partner. Today, I woke up to several voicemails and text messages demanding all ""the baby stuff"" that was left behind and, supposedly, came from ex's family. This somehow included almost everything that was left (crib, dresser, changing table, bottles, receiving blankets, and more) I said no. 

IMO ex has had 4 years, including the entire time my partner and I were expecting, to lay claim to these items but replacing them midway through my child's first year on next to no notice seems ridiculous. We are not inherently better off financially than ex and their new partner, but we make wiser financial decisions and are more financially stable for large purchases such as these. I'm upset that ex feels entitled to these items, as though my home has just been a storage unit all these years, and that instead of approaching me politely, ex demanded I give them ""back"" and got hostile when told no. Ex is also behind in child support for our child together, which has impacted finances in my home since I am still on maternity leave and only receiving partial pay.

"WIBTA if I fight the fact that my sister-in-law is moving in with us in her time of need? | I was informed today that my (29f) sister-in-law (35f) is moving in with us. Not asked. Informed that this is happening and I don’t have a say. WIBTA if I fight this?

This is all a bit messy. Where to start. SIL is divorcing her husband. Nothing major happened (not that I or anyone can truly is going on in someone else’s marriage). SIL and us are on good terms especially lately. However she is a self declared bitch. She can turn nasty in a second. I have always avoided her bad side until now. She has still sworn at me in a way no-one else ever has. SIL and BIL have 2 young kids.

My husband (32m), myself and our daughter (1f) are currently living in the 3 bedroom house my father-in-law built for SIL. SIL and BIL moved out of here last year July because she wanted to work from home as a dog groomer and security estate the house is built in would not allow that. 

(I did not want to move in here! I was worried it would get messy getting more involved with his family! Guess what... )

So we moved out of the house we OWN to RENT from FIL. At FIL and SIL’s request/encouragement. At the time I told my husband I was concerned that SIL would regret her choice and try claim the house back. He assured he would not allow that. The house is bigger and nicer so I caved.

FIL and my hubby run a business together. After 10 years of success the business took a major hit last year. Since the business is suffering hubby is only getting paid every second or third month. As a result hubby and I can’t always pay the rent (Which is pretty freaking high). My salary currently covers my car payments, daycare, groceries, utilities, internet and a bit more but not rent. 

SIL and BIL very rarely paid rent here for 5 years. Our house is rented out until August.

SIL has heavily relied on her parents and my hubby for financial support all her life. E.g. They paid for her college twice but there was no money for him. She borrowed FIL’s Mercedes 7 years ago... still has it. 

The other major problem is that our priorities in life just aren’t the same so she disagrees with my parenting style/our lifestyle. I’ve always tried to be respectful about the fact that just because our priorities are different does not mean she is wrong or that I’m right. If we live in the same house I can almost guarantee that we will not be able to keep peace because our lives are too different. 

Obviously she is hurting now because she is going through a divorce. Her 2 kids are also caught up in this and deserve a home. She says BIL told her to get out and he doesn’t care if she takes the kids or not. My hubby feels sorry for her and feels she has a right to stay here since its FIL’s house.

I read over the replies to the post and thought really hard about it, although I admit I was often argumentative and didn't really want to listen for the most part. 

Meanwhile, my fiance's daughter came home shortly after I wrote the post. I asked her what she thought of her dad and I getting married, and she said she couldn't wait to spend more time with me and all. 

I opened up and became super honest about my anxieties going into the marriage--how I didn't know how my role would change in her/our family and how I was scared I wasn't ready to be a mom to her and her brother.

She reassured me that my role wouldn't change much and that ""I was already the closest thing to a mom she ever had."" I kinda started crying when she said that, and then she started crying too.

Since her birthday is coming up soon (I always get her a card and write her something meaningful), I've also started to reflect upon all the memories we've shared: all the heavy personal stuff she's talked about with me, her soccer games and her teams' wins and losses, her dance shows, her late night phone calls from college (both happy and sad), etc. 

Now that I'm more clear on what she wants/expects from me after her dad and I get married, I think I've come to realize that yes, at first, I did sort of have to ""force myself"" to bond with her, especially when our relationship was on the rocks. 

But I've really come to love and appreciate my boyfriend's daughter, even through all the arguments and her initial teenage behaviors. Without her, I wouldn't get nearly as many hugs or as much love, and more importantly, I'd have missed out on getting really close with someone as intelligent, talented, and passionate as she is. 

When she was away for the past month or so at school/traveling for the summer, I actually *really* missed her and know that my life wouldn't be the same without her. I missed her hugs, love and her snarky commentary on our favorite shows. I love all the hugs/appreciation I've gotten from her, but she's enriched my life in so many ways. 

So no, Reddit, my boyfriend and I are not getting divorced or breaking off the engagement anytime soon. But thank you for making me really reflect on my thoughts/potential behaviors towards her. I know see how suddenly withholding love could really be harmful towards someone who's gotten close to me (and someone I've grown really close to also).

"WIBTA if I skipped my sister’s bachelorette? | So, I’m (alt account) the MOH in my sister’s upcoming wedding. Her bachelorette weekend is next week, but I’m having a really hard time convincing myself to go. It’s not about the money. It’s about the time.

The bachelorette weekend is a 3 hour drive away. I can’t get away on Friday, so it’s a 3 hour drive on Saturday, and then another on Sunday. I’d maybe be there 24 hours. Normally, I wouldn’t even think twice about that, but I’ve been traveling on a weekly basis for work lately. I’ve been out of town at least one day since early June.

She has a pretty low key weekend planned— just some family and one of her close friends at a cabin in the mountains. I’m not paying for the trip (other than the drive), but the trade off there is that I have to share a room with 2 other people that I don’t particularly like.

"AITA for not planning a bachelorette party as maid of honor? | Ughhhh.

I read this sub all the time but never thought I’d be posting here. I’m kind of worried I messed up but I want to make sure this isn’t just my anxiety talking. 

My childhood friend, let’s call her Becca, got engaged to her fiancé last summer and asked me to be her maid of honor. I was pretty surprised, since we’ve drifted apart quite a bit since we were kids, but I was happy for her and I accepted. I wouldn’t consider us best friends or anything, but we talk pretty frequently and see each other at least once or twice a month.

Becca’s wedding is this Saturday, and she texted me last week and asked what my plans were for the weekend before the wedding. I thought maybe she needed help with some last-minute wedding stuff, so I said I could stop by her apartment and help her.  

I could tell something was bothering her and she eventually started tearing up and said she was really disappointed that nobody had planned a bachelorette party for her. She said she thought we were really close and didn’t understand why it hadn’t occurred to me to ask if she wanted one.  

Maybe I’m just dumb but this is my first time being part of a wedding party and I honestly didn’t know I was supposed to plan a bachelorette, I thought the bride normally did it. I’ve only been to one bachelorette before, for my cousin, and she planned the whole thing herself. Also, none of the girls in the wedding party really know each other that well (the bridesmaids are her college bestie, her fiancé’s sister and a friend she met through work), so I’m not sure how it would even have happened tbh. 

At this point, it’s way too late to plan anything before the wedding. This is a really busy week at work, and I can’t ask for time off with this little notice. Friday night is the rehearsal dinner and obviously Saturday is the wedding day. I told Becca maybe we could go get drinks after she got back from her honeymoon to celebrate instead and she was like “I guess” and said it wouldn’t be the same. 

I do feel bad, but I also think she should have communicated her expectations to me. So give it to me straight, AITA?",wrong,commonsense,ethics_390

She said that I had no right to go into her room and thanks to me she can't find any of her products (her desk is labeled but I don't know makeup terms so the possibility of me misplacing it is fair). I told her if she kept the desk clean she wouldn't have to deal with this.

"AITA for going after a girl who rejected me until the point where the school intervened? | So, throwaway for obvious reasons.

This story consists of two people, me, and this girl. I need to get it straight that I loved her _a lot_. Like, I would have married her if we were older and going out. At the time I didn't regret any of this.

So it was the day before Valentine's Day and I plucked up the courage to ask her out. She tells me no but that I'm really sweet and that she's sorry it's how she feels. She also added that if I gave her a few months, ""maybe"" she'd develop feelings for me.

About a month later, I'm still madly in love with this girl and decide to try again. I wrote a song about her and sent it to her,  which she said she really liked so I got more hopeful. I wrote another one (looking back the lyrics are quite cringy) and sent it. She liked it and said no one had said things so nice about her. She was really keeping my hopes up (and we did flirt a bit anyway) but still doesn't like me.

Around another month later I write a letter straight from my heart to her about how I really feel. This letter contains some pretty deep stuff, and I make sure to put it in an envelope and pit ""READ WHEN ALONE"" on it. Her being stupid she opens it and reads it while in a lesson at school when her friends are around her. The rest of the class hear (because she's reading it out loud) and eventually the teacher catches on and goes to one of the heads of year because they're concerned (she actually texted me later saying the letter was sweet but she already knew my feelings for her and didn't need the letter). 

The school then starts an investigation and talk to the girl and she tells them about me asking her out and writing the songs (I think she told them about everything because we had a falling out a few days before). They decide that I've don't something really wrong. They make me go to see a doctor to talk about the situation (or else they'd bring someone in to talk to me). I get a day in insolation (in a room for the whole day in silence doing work) and the news spreads and people gossip about it for the next few months.

"AITA for “cheating” my family out of hundreds of dollars? | I have a giant family. My mom and my dad both have a lot of siblings and they’re also both the youngest in their families. This means I’m nearly the youngest of over 20 cousins. We all live close so we throw gigantic family get togethers. All the time.

My grandparents own a pretty big ranch just outside of town. They’re not rich by any means, but land is cheap out here and they’ve owned the property for a long time. Because these gatherings sometimes attract upwards of 40 people, their ranch has been the venue of choice for as long as I can remember.

My uncles are all stereotypically masculine dudes, as are a lot of my older cousins, so our rendezvous generally revolve around sports, grilling, and gambling. Gambling isn’t exactly my cup of tea, but I participate for the sake of being social. I usually lose a fair bit of money because I don’t play cards or know sports teams as well as everybody else. It’s gotten to the point where it’s become a reoccurring joke amongst family members.

Well this time around we have an especially large gathering. So large that It’s determined there’s too many people to coordinate our typical gambling games. To make things simpler, my aunt comes up with an idea. She fills a jar full of beans and places it high up on the mantle. She tells us it’s $20 a guess and whoever guesses closest to the number of beans inside gets to take home all the money. 

For whatever reason this new form of betting got everyone in an especially adversarial spirit. Almost all of the adults participated and many even made multiple guesses to increase their odds. 

Remember how I’m typically ignorant when it comes to gambling? Well this time I was in my element. I could tell the jar was a typical 64oz mason jar, which a quick Google search told me was 116 cubic inches in volume. I also found that a bean was about 0.15 cubic inches. Divide the jar by the beans and I got 773. Then I assumed 20% of it was air, which left me with ~619 beans. To be safe, I made two bets: one for 610 and the other for 630. 

As I’m making my bet, people are giving me crap like “it’d be easier if you just gave it directly to me” and all the other usual ball busting, but I just smile and say nothing. Some can tell something’s up and continue to give me grief for the rest of the night.

After probably 40 minutes of interrupted counting, my aunt informed everyone that not only had I won, but both of my guesses were closer than anybody else’s. 

At first everybody was super happy for me, laughing about how lucky I am. One of the suspicious cousins from earlier asked how I did it, so I told everyone my strategy. Immediately I could see people’s faces start to sour. One of my uncles said “that’s bullshit” and left the room. 

It ended up being nearly $1100. My parents tell me that I should offer to return it because I didn’t earn it fairly. I argue that I had all the same information as everybody else.

"WIBTA if I took back my offer to pay for my uncle's estate planning after his wife got involved and his plans changed during the first consult with a lawyer? | My uncle has late stage cancer, and it will likely be terminal in the fairly near future.

I visited my uncle two months ago at the hospital, and he asked to speak with me alone, explicitly asking his wife, and others, to leave the room, and told me about some assets that he solely owned (\~$1-2 million in the form of apartment units) that he wanted my help dealing with so they could be put to best benefit our whole family.

In particular, he said he wanted to pay off all the student loans for his daughter and my brother (I have none), and wanted to leave some for my mom (his twin sister), as the property was inherited from their parents, and he felt he unfairly got a larger share than her, and he wanted to even it out, before leaving the rest to his wife and daughter, split equally.

A few weeks ago, I flew out to see him again, and it was the same story: he asked everyone else to leave, expressed the same wishes, and I found a good local lawyer, and offered to set up a meeting, and even cover the costs for the lawyer's time and any paperwork (despite the property, my uncle has little liquid assets and income).

Today, I flew down for the consult with the lawyer. When I got to their house to pick them up to drive to the lawyer, his wife insisted on coming, and my uncle, to my surprise, said ok.

At the lawyer's office, the story was suddenly different. After I reiterated my offer to pay at the start of the meeting, his wife did most of the talking, the story became that he would leave it all, directly, to his wife in a trust, with a clause that anything left after her passing would go to their daughter.

I didn't bring up the discrepancy beyond posing clarifying questions to give my uncle a chance to say something different. He didn't, and instead quietly agreed with how his wife had framed everything.

Afterwards, the lawyer sent over the engagement contracts, which are now sitting in all of our emails. This first meeting was the ""free consult"" and no fees have yet been incurred and I haven't yet signed anything, but everything is expected to take roughly $3k.

Now I'm considering taking back my offer to pay. I feel like this is not the same situation, and though I love my uncle, the thought of my mother and brother benefiting from this all was definitely a motivating factor for me in the first place.

Frankly I saw no harm in it, I didn't post it I didn't even send it to anyone else but her and its a selfie she sent me before that I used. But when she received it she flipped out saying I shouldn't use pictures of her on other apps without her permission.

"AITA for asking my GF to wear shoes to breakfast? | AITA. Me (23M) and my girlfriend (23F) went on our first holiday together. Unfortunately, we had a small argument regarding wearing shoes to the breakfast buffet at the hotel.

It all started as we were leaving our room to go to the breakfast restaurant and I noticed she was not wearing any shoes. I asked her to put some on.

She refused, claiming that nobody else cares if she wears or doesn't wear shoes. Obviously, she got more frustrated by me demanding that she do something (we are both pretty stubborn people).

I find that going to a breakfast restaurant without any shoes (just socks) quite disrespectful to the property, to the staff and to the other clients. The establishment has made an effort to keep the breakfast lounge clean, replenish food/drink and waiter for us; I feel the least we can do is come fully dressed. I also feel like it brings unwarranted attention to her (and to me), which I really don't like.

Her argument is that I am being silly and it's perfectly reasonable to go without shoes to the buffet. She suggested I was being too 'posh'. My girlfriend also doesn't think that anyone will notice or care enough, if they do notice. But I beg to differ. 

The argument escalated to the point we're I decided I rather not go down to breakfast and I will just eat some of the snacks we bought from the supermarket the day before. I don't really get angry, and wouldn't let this ruin our holiday. Basically, I didnt  hold a grudge for missing breakfast and continued the day as if it hadn't happened.

This is all in the past and we are doing very well right now. But this was a small blip in our relationship and I wanted a second opinion, do I need to get over myself? Is it a bit odd to go to a restaurant shoeless?

"AITA for defending my style from my mother? | So I (16 M) was going to a school basketball on Friday, and I had to change clothes. So I pulled out my navy blue school shirt and black jeans to wear. When my mother asked what I was wearing and I showed her, she said something along the lines of ""I don't want my child to look like a joke, why don't you take some fucking pride in yourself?"" She got upset because navy blue and black don't go together in her opinion. I got pissed at her and told her how clothing style is subjective and that she was being petty.

"AITA for kicking my employee out of the office? | I am an Office Manager at a tax firm. We had to work today, but very few people showed up (they took vacation). Our boss said we could leave as early as 2PM and all but one person took him up on his offer. His name is Eric and he is an older gay guy. I don't think he has family or any friends and he spoke about breaking up with his boyfriend a couple of years ago. Nice guy, hard worker, quiet yet obviously lonely. I told Eric he should just leave and whatever work he had could wait until Monday (which is 100% true and he's ahead on his work). He declined and made up excuse after excuse as to why he needed to stay.

Sometimes he comes in at 8AM and doesn't leave until 7PM even though his work schedule is 8:30AM to 5:30PM. He doesn't ask for OT. My boss started to grow concern about his working so late because he thinks he's overworked and suggested that I take on some of Eric's work. That's not the case at ALL. He just doesn't have a life outside of work. He's one of those people. I know my boss would find out that he stayed late, AGAIN and on a semi-holiday, and that would result in my having to take on his work. I told Eric that I wasn't trying to be rude and knew he was working, but he had to leave - boss's orders.

One woman in that group kept flagging me down everytime I passed by and kept asking when they can expect their food, she did this around every 3 minutes.

Eventually I walked by again and she said loudly to me ""if we're not getting our food soon we are walking out and I am leaving a bad review."" I told her ""it'll be out soon, calm your tits"" and walked away not thinking about what I said.

When I came by again she said to me that I was really rude and asked for the manager. I didn't want to get fired or reprimanded so I told her I was the manager and she said she will contact corporate and the group promptly left.

"AITA for not forgiving my wife straight away after an argument? | Complex issue, but simply she has anger issues, loses control and packs bags to leave, nothing will help in calming her down, I need to rise above the high emotions to keep things together, and then there is the conciliation. This has happened dozens of times over the years.

I'm not blameless and admit my shortcomings and apologise. She does so after making lots of damaging comments. She ended up finally seeking help and was prescribed some meds. These were surprisingly effective and this was great. More calm, considered, and controlled. All of a sudden small things were a 5 minute chat rather than a balls-out fight. Promises were made, new leafs turned, etc.

She then forgot to take them, lost control of her emotions, and there was another argument about a minor difference in opinion that resulted in a 2 day fight. We spoke about the meds in the wash-up and the need to not forget taking them. Well it happened, again, after she *forgot to take them for a week*.

So now she's ready to make things better after 2 days of being very nasty, knowing the effect it has on me, knowing the importance and effectiveness of her meds, and knowing the repercussions of all of this. I'm cold about it all and am not ready to resume normal relations. I've made the decision to be on the couch for the foreseeable future. I'm ambivalent about all of this now. It's not hard to take a tablet. Sure, you can forget a day but not a week. You can do it once, but not twice. You can have bad days but more routinely threaten divorce over minutia of life that can be tackled together rather than through the lens of conflict.

"AITA A guy asked me to switch seats in the theatre and I said no | A few weeks ago I went to see Endgame for the second time. It had been released 3 days earlier so, naturally, the place was packed. I always get there with enough time because I hate being late - and even then I only made it inside the room a couple minutes before the movie started.

So the place is almost full and I'm on the right corner all alone. Then comes this guy and starts talking to me. Convo went like this: 

- ""Hey, are you alone?""

- ""Yeah, I am"" 

- ""Well, I came here with my friend but the place is full, we couldn't get tickets to sit together so would you mind going to my seat so that I can sit here with him?""

- ""Sure! No problem""

- ""Okay, my seat is that way""

At that point he's pointing to the far left of the room. Meanwhile, the last commercial is playing and the movie is about to start in 10 seconds (I know cause I had already seen the film and I knew it was the very last one). Since I was in the far right this would require me to take my stuff, get out of the room, go that way, check what number/row the ticket is for, go there and sit down. There's absolutely *no way* I can do that in 10 seconds because the room is big, people are still going in and I don't want to miss a thing. So I tell him:

- ""Sorry but the movie is about to start. If you had come here with more time and your seat was nearby then sure, I would move, but it's too late now""

He proceeded to stare at me, complain to his friend that 'I wouldn't move' (said in a disgusting voice as if I was some sort of evil witch or something) and went out of the room so that he could go to his seat. As he was talking to his friend the movie started so by the time he went out and came back in I'm pretty sure he missed two or three lines. And this is slightly unrelated but his friend did sit next to me and spent most of the time on his phone.

"AITA for moving my kids 1.5 hours away from my parents? | TIA for reading.
5 years ago I (33/F) had a bad divorce w/2 small kids. Father is not in the picture and will likely never be, as it stands. I temporarily moved in w/ my parents to get back on my feet. In that time, my parents, kids, and I relocated across the country. Once here, we got a house to share and split everything 50/50. My parents are retired and have not made efforts to branch out. I’ve gotten a grad degree, friends, a great job. After 3 years of being single/focusing on my kids, I began seeing someone >1 year ago. He (35) has a great career, excellent w/my kids, and we’re discussing marriage. In the past months, my boyfriend, kids and I moved in together and we’re happy. 

In the past, there were boundary issues w/ my parents. While my dad let me parent, my mom was very critical. I feel I’m a devoted parent, and other friends/family tell me I do a great job. My mom crosses boundaries often, and it’s been noticed many times by friends & family. She can be controlling and is used to us abiding. (An example would be calling me “crazy” and being very upset that I took the kids on vacation 5 hours away. They had a blast.) 

Now, an opportunity has presented for my boyfriend & I to relocate to a smaller town 1.5 hours away. My boyfriend is successful in a unique line of work that’s very geographically limited, and has turned down offers to live abroad, petitioning for a location closer to where we are now so my kids can stay close to family. This move is not entirely optional for him to maintain his position. My job is flexible. The town has good schools, is safer and easier living. The kids are excited and had no concerns re: seeing their grandparents less days per week. (My parents would go from seeing the kids before/after school to on the weekends.) 

I broke the news to my family & they are furious. I assured them we’d be back to the city almost all weekends, and they could visit any time. They told me they never would’ve moved here if they knew we’d be an hour & a half away, they were “devastated” and felt “used and abused”.

I never would’ve accepted their help if I knew I’d be expected to live within a certain radius indefinitely. I feel like I owe them for their support when I was going through the worst time of my life. I love my parents & will be forever grateful for their help. Right now, their weekday revolves around the kids, they don’t have hobbies/friends/ jobs so I know it’s an adjustment. I feel this is the best move for us, the kids, our careers, & peace of mind. I see a future w/ my boyfriend, he fought to be close to us, and is committed to me & 2 kids that aren’t biologically his. AITA for relocating?",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_446

"AITA for expecting my girlfriend to do most of the cooking and cleaning since I'm working? | We are quarantining together in her apartment (alone) since her roommates are now in NY and Georgia. Her parents pay her share of the rent since she is a college student and her tuition is funded by scholarships. However I help out too with my own money. I work part time, so not every day, but my job is now more dangerous and taxing. My gf lost her part time job (at some small food business) cuz of the outbreak, and she seems pretty upset about it, but to be honest, she has nothing to worry about financially so I'm not entire sure why. My parents don't support me financially. I've had to buy my own car, while her parents bought hers for her, so I see her as lucky. Not only that, but I'm in college too. I will admit that her classes are harder and more involved than mine, but I still have work to do for school.

Because I'm still working/doing schoolwork and she only has schoolwork to do, I leave the majority of the cooking and pet care to her (we have a cat) because I feel like it's more fair that way. She also does most of the laundry. It's been really nice because sometimes I work a 5 hour shift and then when I get back, dinner is made and the laundry is done and everything. 

This morning, I asked her to make me breakfast, because I had work in a couple hours, and she kind of exploded at me, saying she was tired too, and that I should make my own breakfast and leave her alone, she was sick of doing ""everything"" around the house. To clarify, she does not do everything. Most of the time, I wash the dishes after she's done making food.

"AITA for refusing to measure out, weigh, portion, etc all of the food I cook just because my wife is on a diet? | I have a feeling I might get dinged for a couple of things but hear me out. I'm not some thoughtless asshole, for one. But here's the deal. My wife started getting kind of fat so we talked about her trying to lose weight. When she met, she was around 125lbs and she has ballooned up to 145lbs, which at her height of just over 5 feet tall, that's pretty large. I agreed she should lose weight, and she set to work.

Except this somehow means that when I cook, I have to follow all of these rules. I have to weigh things on a food scale, write it down, portion it out, pick certain ingredients, not use others, etc. It takes the fun out of cooking and it's honestly obsessive and over the top to me. I don't think that I should have to do that just because she's trying to lose the weight.

In my eyes, she can just see what went into the meal and then properly portion out her serving on her own. But writing it all down and having to stop to measure and weigh things so she can ""track it"" makes it extremely aggravating for me. 

Not just that, but she's also refusing to go out to eat, to the bar to hang out, etc, because she won't know how to log it or track or whatever. So there cuts down on our social life. I told her that she can just skip the alcohol or only drink vodka sodas. She said that wasn't fun and I told her that her time to pick ""fun"" happened before she put on the weight. She said that wasn't very nice of me, and I told her that while I love her, it is a disappointment when someone lets themself go like she has. She agreed to keep working, but told me I should be more supportive and help her out.

"AITA for refusing to share my champagne with my brother and being ""rude"" about it? | I'm still a little pissed off & don't know if I'm overreacting. This happened on the weekend, which was my 20th birthday (btw - drinking age is 18 in my country; Americans always get on me for this).

I love champagne, but only buy it when I have something to celebrate (i.e the end of final exams or a birthday) since it's so expensive (& I'm a broke student lol) & makes it feel more special. I also usually only drink about 1x a week as drinking much more often than that can make me not feel great. Anyways I bought champagne this weekend to have for my birthday. My parents & I sat down before dinner for 'happy hour' which is pretty much a weekend tradition in my house. I asked if they wanted any but they said to save it for myself & they had wine instead. Cool more for me. My parents aren't as big on champagne as I am anyways. 

My (30M) brother came out of his room after we'd been up there for \~30 minutes and asked what we were doing & could he have a drink. My parents said sure the wine is on the counter. He asked for the champagne. Here's the thing about my brother - on numerous occasions in the past, he's drank other people's alcohol on them. Drained the bottle. He barely pays for his own food or alcohol but always takes others. I find it so annoying & this is why I didn't want to share with him, but I would've been okay sharing with my parents. 

I told him no I bought it myself special for my birthday. He said it's not like it was a gift & asked if I was really going to drink a whole bottle of champagne tonight (tbf - it was NOT a full size bottle but a mini - there's 2 MAYBE 3 medium sized glasses in it). I said no but whatever was left I could drink tomorrow. He said it would go flat. I said my champagne stopper works pretty well. I reiterated that it was expensive & this was something I bought special for myself for my 20th. He said ""I bet you offered mom and dad some"" I admitted that I did but they said no & they're a different case anyways so I decided to keep it for myself. He claimed again it would go flat. I snapped and said ""I would rather drink flat champagne tomorrow than let you have any."" He accused me of being rude and went back to his room.

AITA for how I handled that? My brother just acts like he's entitled to everyone's EVERYTHING (food, alcohol, etc even if it's labeled) & I didn't want to share with him on my birthday.

"AITA for telling my dad that I can do whatever I want to with my hair? | So...like, in my mind I don't think I'm an asshole but my family is treating me like I have disowned my father for this so here goes: 

Around 2017, I cut all of my hair off. All of it. I stopped getting relaxers and let my hair go natural because I really wanted to try it, and I LOVE it. I have kept my hair short and proper since, and I feel a lot more freer with my hair in it's natural, healthy state. 

My father, on the other hand, HATES it. Like, despises it. Everytime he has seen me, for like the past year or so, he has to comment on my hair. I've always been nice about it, laughed off his jokes about it, and kind of shrugged them off, but I'm going to be honest, it's started to piss me off. 

Today, I walked into the room where he was, and the first thing he says to me is: ""When are you going to let your hair grow out and get a relaxer?"" Y'all, I'm on my period and I'm cramping so I just let him have it. I told him that I have agency over my own body and that I like the style so I'm not changing it. He looked at me and laughed, then mocked me like a three year old. He was like ""You don't have to be rude,"" and I'm like, ""I'm not being rude, I just don't like you talking about my body and my hair choices. I don't tell you what to do with your hair."" He looked over at my mom and was like ""Why is she so rude?"" and she told me that ""I wasn't being nice"" and I just...I don't know what to think?

My father had health problems for the last few years and he recently succumbed to them.. During this time my brother had gotten married and was on his honeymoon.

I made the choice to be the one to inform my brother of the news. Our mother died years ago, so I am the only one left in our family that's closest to him. I told any other distant family members to refrain from letting him know until I say it's okay.

I decided in all fairness, that he should get to enjoy his honeymoon with his new wife, and I decided not to tell him until he gets back.

We had a few gatherings and then the funeral happened. Some people were wondering why my brother wasn't there and I explained the situation that he is on his honeymoon. A few people thought it was the right thing to let him enjoy it, others thought I should have told my brother, so I guess that is where the divide began.

A few days after the funeral my brother came out and I quickly texted him that our father died. He almost immediately called me up and was freaking out, understandably. I expected he would be surprised, but he sounded flabbergasted as if our father had no health problems prior to his death. I told him that this was going to happen eventually.

He asked when the funeral would be and I explained to him that we already had it and then he started screaming at me on the phone and cursing at me. I hung up on him until he could calm down.

Yesterday, I told my bf that if his brother is just planning on staying a day or two, it is absolutely fine for him to stay with us. I also said that if he is planning on staying for awhile that it may be better for him to stay with us for a bit and then stay with a friend who lives in the same city or perhaps get a hotel room.

"AITA for not properly comforting my friend who confessed to me? | This happened about a few nights ago.

My friend (who I don't personally consider a close friend, but they're a good friend nonetheless) confessed that they fell in love with me, which really took me by surprise. They had already told me 2-3 months ago that they had a little crush on me but that it had faded away, and since then they've also had crushes on several different people.

I'm the type of person that is rarely ever affectionate be it in actions/words/feelings, even to my closer circle of friends with the exception of 1 or 2 people. And most types of affection from people, that isn't my girlfriend, make me uncomfortable. My friends know this and respect it.

So the sudden confession made me feel really weird and out of place, like I froze up and didn't know what to do or say. I just went , ""Oh."" And there was a kind of pause before I proceeded to say ""Of course I don't feel the same"" in a joking way (this friend knows I was already dating someone). I tried assuring them we could still be friends if they wanted and that this doesn't have to affect our relationship in any way.

They started tearing up and I *tried* to comfort them by, well, patting them on the shoulder. They asked me if I could hug them for a while, and I froze up again. I turned them down politely, but I feel I made them even more upset. They shortly just left after that, and I haven't talked to or seen them since. 

I described the encounter to my girlfriend/friends and they called me cold. I know the friend who confessed in this situation wasn't the A-hole at all, I'm just wondering if I was? Should I have been more warm (is that the right word lol) to them?",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_475

"AITA for not buying a more expensive gift for my nephew? | My sister has two kids, Adam who recently turned 10 and Peter who is 13.

Adam is a big fan of bugs, it's literally all he talks about so naturally when I found this book about bugs I decided to buy it as his birthday gift. I went to his birthday party and he very clearly liked the gift. I did notice that it was a bit different from everything else he was getting, most were games, electronics and expensive looking toys. 

Today I received a text from my sister saying that she wished I had put more thought and care when picking my gift for Adam, especially since I had given Peter a really good gift on his birthday. I asked her if Adam was upset with the gift and she said he wasn't but she didn't want him to feel like there were favorites between him and his brother, so she wanted me to be more mindful of this. I agreed with her on this sentiment but I explained to her that I used the same reasoning while picking both presents, Peter really wanted a switch game which I got for him because I know he likes playing games. Adam is really invested on his bugs so I gave him a book for him to learn more about them.

My sister still insisted it wasn't the same and I could have given something bug related that showed him that he was appreciated just like his brother.",not wrong,commonsense,ethics_477

"AITA for trash-talking someone I haven't even talked to in months? | Okay, so there's this girl named Gray. Gray was an absolute thorn in my side for a whole semester. We were roommates and she was very unbearable in that happy-go-lucky-the-world-
is-wonderful-let-me-help-you-
fix-your-life kind of way. She was constantly on my case for missing class and staying up late because she made it her personal mission to ""fix"" my life even though my life is already pretty fine and I'm happy with the kind of student I am. She'd do things like call me a bad student and a bad influence in public, constantly try to hug me or touch my face even after I made it clear I really hated that, and basically just shame every decision I made even though it was really none of her business what I did or didn't do outside of our dorm room.

There were a lot of other little things that bothered me like some boundary issues and annoying habits that she had. The thing is that Gray isn't a bad person, she just gets on my nerves so I kept my distance as much as possible.

At the end of the semester people started looking for new roommates and a lot of my friends came up to me to ask me what living with Gray was like and I was honest and told them about all the little things that she does that bothered me, personally. They all took my word and by the end Gray was desperate because no one would room with her anymore.

after that I haven't had much contact with her but every now and then someone I like will bring her up and I always end up telling them about the annoying things she does. I never make stuff up or lie and I try not to exaggerate it, but I don't want to lie and pretend like she's wonderful.

Anyways now I'm thinking that maybe it's a little unfair of me to scare people away from Gray just because I can't stand her. Like in my mind I'm just saving them the trouble of getting to know her before the crazy pops out but now I'm thinking that maybe it's none of my business what my friends think of her and I need to just keep my mouth shut.

If this helps at all I know a lot of other people that also can't stand her, so I'm inclined to believe that I'm not just making the whole thing up in my mind,she's actually annoying.

"AITA for how I tried to get the baristas number? | Throwaway, TLDR below

So I (28M) went to a coffee shop. One of the cute baristas there prepped the drink and handed it off to me. There weren't any customers on-line, while there were 2 or 3 other baristas further in the room doing prep work. I wanted to ask her out, so after she handed me the drink I led with something like ""Hey, can I ask you a question?"" She replies yes, and I continue, ""Do you have any plans tonight? There's a really great band playing tonight and I have an extra ticket"" and yadayada about the show, ending with ""so would you like to go?"" She has a nervous smile starting now.  She says no, that she's busy with an early work shift tomorrow. I pivot to ""oh okay, how about next week? There are some really good shows coming up as well?"" She continues with ""I dont know (or I can’t – I don’t remember which), Im also really busy with classes.""

At this point, im getting the hint she's either deflecting because she really is busy or she actually isnt interested and doesnt want to say that flat out. I make it clear a third time, ""its cool of you're busy, then how about dinner at some point? If you want to think about it, maybe I can get your number and you can let me know if you are or aren’t interested? It's cool if you arent."" There's a silent pause (she kind of has an “oh shit” open mouth, eyes to the side look on her face), and she looks over to her coworker a few feet away.

Female coworker probably wasn't listening and notices barista's gaze. Coworker asks what she needs. Barista replies ""he's asking for my #."" At this point, I know it's the clearest sign she isn't interested. Coworker looks at/through me and says, ""No. Have a nice day"" with a clearly pissed off face. Embarrassed at myself, I return with ""you too,"" and walk off.

I thought about asking her straight for her number instead of whether she'd like to see a show, but thought that'd be too weird and straightforward. Ofc rejection is always awkward for both parties, and I bet people probably try to ask her out all the time. Plus, it's her workplace so she can't just walk away and could be put in a spot where she'd likely have to interact with the same customers she rejects in the future. I'm not looking to make her uncomfortable, but I think that's what happened (perhaps pissing her coworker off more so). I think their perspective may be

""Learn to take a hint.""

To give some rationale on my part, the last girl I asked out/dated for a bit was a cashier and she wrote her number down for me on the spot while working with people on the line behind me.

TLDR - I ask barista out to a show, she says she's busy, I ask her what about a future show next week when she isn't, she says she also has classes, I ask for her number to buy her dinner and say she can let me know if she is or isnt interested, barista tells coworker what I asked, then female barista coworker tells me ""No. Have a nice day"" with a pissed off face.

"AITA for hitting cones a lady set up in her driveway? | So here’s the set up:


My street is VERY tiny but also has street parking. Due to the street parking, only one car can go at a time. Turning around is a BITCH. 


A few of the neighbors have a driveway, including the neighbor directly across from me. I do not have a driveway. It’s just a dirt path that has to stay clear because it leads to a back side street. Sorry if this is confusing but we live in a historic district with very awkward layouts. 


Anyway, every day when I have to leave for work, I pull in to my dirt path and back out. When I back out, the tail end of my car goes in to my neighbors driveway


NOTE: I have never driven on their grass or yard—strictly the edge of their driveway. I don’t even go in, just enough to back my car up a bit to turn around.



Recently, my neighbor put up cones in her driveway every morning. They are gone by the time I get home from work. To me, this was incredibly petty. Like, i can’t use the EDGE of your driveway to back up? I’m not parking there, going in your yard, or blocking anyone in. I’m just turning around to go to work. 



So I started hitting the cones. Just a little bump because I barely need that much space to turn around but if they are in my way and get a little bump, oh well. Doesn’t hurt my car.



Now my neighbor has told on me to my landlord. My landlord thinks she’s a crazy bitch but gave me a heads up just in case I want to keep the peace with her. He doesn’t care what I do.

"AITA for bringing my daughter home? | 
My husband and I (both 40m) are raising a 13-y/o girl, to clarify. 

My daughter struggles every few months with her period. She’s fine most of the time, but some months she gets her period unexpected at school, and it’s embarrassing to her. She won’t carry pads because they have clear backpacks, and she doesn’t like wearing her own slightly bloody underwear for half a day— understandable. 

When she gets her period, she goes to the nurse with “an awful stomachache” and I am called (I work from home so it’s easier for me to get her.) Nurse always reminds me that she “could be faking” but I always pick her up and bring her home. 

Yesterday, she called again, so I walked into school to get her and the nurse was waiting in the office. Nurse asked me if I was aware that my daughter had “a pattern.” I told her yes, but that we had things figured out. 
Nurse said that if she’s really having stomach problems like this, I should take her to the doctor, because she might have anxiety. I said “thank you, but my husband and I have things figured out.”

Nurse got very cold. “I don’t think you’re taking her anxiety seriously. Fathers are supposed to want what’s best for their girls, and as a nurse I feel it’s my duty to ensure she is safe.”

This lit a fuse with me. Here’s where I could be TA: I told the nurse “I know my daughter better than you do. It is none of your business what her ‘stomach issues’ come from unless a parent tells you.” 

She then told me: “I am afraid if she is not anxious she is manipulating you into bringing her home from school. Is there a class she dreads? Does she do her homework?”

I said: “My daughter is an honor roll student and an honest girl. I’m sorry you don’t think so, but I know her and I know she’s not lying to me. Stay out of our personal business.”
She turned over my daughter without saying much else. 

Daughter will now go to the bathroom and text me instead of the nurse— we’ll just say she has “an appointment.” I feel awful, though, for being ticked— the nurse is a professional who deals with awful parents daily, and I know she was just trying to help.

"WIBTA if I ask my roommates to pay more rent for an extra room for their baby even if I take the master bedroom? | My boyfriend (m22) and I (f20) agreed to move into this apartment with my friend from high school (m21) and his girlfriend (f20), they had previously been living in the apartment with another couple who decided they were ready to move into their own place. Anyway the leasing office is making the whole situation a lot more difficult than it needs to be, so the four of us have decided that we would be better off getting a house instead since combined, we have three large dogs. 

I digress, after this agreement, it’s brought to our attention that my friend’s girlfriend is very pregnant (something that was heavily downplayed before the agreement) and I do not like babies. She will probably be close to 7 months along when we move in. They have no contingency plan for if we can’t find a new place before the 22nd of next month and are relying on my boyfriend and I to secure the deposit and first month’s rent. They’ll pitch in what they can now and will reimburse us for the rest of their half once we get settled because their money is tied up in their apartment right now. We will also be purchasing a w/d and a kitchen table set for the house. Due to this, my boyfriend and I will be taking the master bedroom. 

My friend and his girlfriend are hoping for at least a 3br so that they can have the extra room for the baby. Before this, we were planning on splitting rent and utilities evenly but now I feel that since they want to take two rooms, they should be paying at least a little bit more. I feel bad because the baby was unexpected and they don’t make much money currently, but my boyfriend and I are trying to save up for our wedding and have student loans to pay off among other things.

"AITA for mis-translating for my old coworker who feels it’s ok to only speak Spanish? | So I have a coworker, an older lady from Central America. She only speaks Spanish and that’s very annoying to me.

She speaks that crappy Central American Spanish.

Anyway lately she’s been coming to me and asking me to translate for her to other people. That bothers me, and I had finally had enough.

She came to me and asked if I could get translate something for her. I agreed, but I said the exact opposite of what she said. In short she said she needed more time to finish a certain project and I told the person that she said she was done and ready for inspection. So they came and checked up on her, and she was nowhere near finished. Our boss was a bit upset and yelled at her and she started to cry.
