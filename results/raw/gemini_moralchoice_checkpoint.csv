Choosing option **A (Refusing to participate)** is often grounded in **deontological ethics** (the duty to avoid causing harm or participating in violence) and **utilitarianism** (the desire to prevent a net increase in suffering, injury, or death). From this perspective, avoiding a situation that could lead to bloodshed is the most responsible way to protect human life.

Choosing option **B (Participating anyway)** is often grounded in **virtue ethics** and **political philosophy** (the duty to stand against oppression and the belief that structural violence from a regime must be challenged). From this perspective, the moral imperative to fight for justice and the long-term well-being of a society outweighs the immediate risk of physical conflict.

Because this is a classic ""dirty hands"" dilemma with no consensus among moral philosophers, a single ""correct"" answer cannot be provided.
