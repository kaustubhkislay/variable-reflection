morables_414,"A certain man took a deposit from a friend but intended to keep it for himself. When the depositor then summoned him to swear an oath regarding the deposit, he realized the danger he was in and prepar",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the dialogue:

1.  **The Premise:** A man intends to commit perjury (swearing a false oath) to steal a deposit. He encounters the god ""Oath,"" who tells him he usually only returns to punish the wicked every 30 or 40 years.
2.  **The Action:** Believing he has decades before he will face divine retribution, the man immediately commits the crime.
3.  **The Consequence:** The man is caught and punished by the god the very next day.
4.  **The Explanation:** The god explains that while his schedule is generally slow, he can and will return immediately if he is specifically provoked or challenged by someone's brazenness.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **B, C, and D** are irrelevant to the specific themes of divine punishment and timing present in the text.
*   **E** focuses on ""conscience,"" but the story focuses on external punishment (being dragged to a cliff) rather than internal guilt.
*   **A** directly addresses the core irony of the story: the man thought he could predict when punishment would arrive based on a set timeframe, but he learned that justice against the wicked can strike at any moment.

The story serves as a warning that one should not assume they have time to escape the consequences of their actions; divine justice is unpredictable and can be swift.

morables_66,"A Lark had made her nest in the early spring on the young green wheat. The brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their feathers, whe",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the progression of the plot:

1.  **The First Threat:** The farmer decides to ask his neighbors for help. The mother Lark is not worried because she knows that relying on others often leads to delay or inaction. If the farmer isn't doing the work himself, he isn't truly ready to start.
2.  **The Second Threat:** The farmer decides to take matters into his own hands, hiring workers and committing to doing the work himself. The mother Lark recognizes this as the true sign of action.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that a task is only certain to be completed when the person responsible for it takes the initiative to do it themselves, rather than waiting on the charity or assistance of friends and neighbors.

*   **A) Self-help is the best help:** This aligns perfectly with the Lark's observation. When the farmer decided to help himself rather than wait for others, the work finally began.
*   **B) Cunning often outwits itself:** This does not apply, as no one is being ""outwitted"" by their own trickery.
*   **C) Wisdom grows with determination:** While the Lark is wise, the core of the story is about personal initiative.
*   **D) Do unto others...:** This is the Golden Rule, which is not the focus here.
*   **E) Even the tiniest cradle...:** This is a poetic sentiment about spring/birth, but it doesn't capture the practical lesson of the farmer's actions.

The traditional moral of this Aesop's fable is that one should not depend on others for what they can do themselves.

As soon as he realized what was going on, Aesop -- who w",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** Aesop, a wise man, is found playing a children's game (marbles). This represents leisure and playfulness.
2.  **The Conflict:** A passerby mocks him, assuming that a serious or wise man should never engage in such ""frivolous"" activities.
3.  **The Metaphor:** Aesop uses the imagery of the bow. A bow kept under constant tension (tightly strung) loses its elasticity and eventually breaks. A bow that is unstrung (rested) retains its strength and utility for when it is truly needed.
4.  **The Lesson:** Just as a bow needs periods of rest to remain effective, the human mind and spirit need periods of play and relaxation to remain sharp and functional. Constant ""tension"" or seriousness leads to burnout or failure.

While choice **E** touches on the theme (Aesop's wisdom was indeed hidden behind play), it describes the situation rather than the *lesson* Aesop explicitly explains. Choice **A** captures the core message: that resting the mind through play is essential to maintaining one's capabilities.

morables_377,"The story goes that a sow who had delivered a whole litter of piglets loudly accosted a lioness, 'How many children do you breed?' asked the sow. 'I breed only one,' said the lioness, 'but he is very ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the sow and the lioness:

1.  **The Characters' Actions:** The sow is boasting about the size of her litter (quantity). She ""loudly accosts"" the lioness, implying a sense of superiority based on the number of offspring she has produced.
2.  **The Lioness's Response:** The lioness acknowledges she only produces one offspring at a time. However, she retorts that her one offspring is a lion—a creature of significantly higher status, strength, and ""breeding"" than a pig. 
3.  **The Contrast:** The story sets up a direct contrast between many common things (piglets) and one exceptional thing (a lion). 
4.  **The Lesson:** The lioness's statement, ""but he is very well bred,"" emphasizes that the excellence or ""quality"" of an individual outweighs the sheer volume or ""quantity"" of others.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Quality is more valuable than quantity:** This directly reflects the lioness's argument that one lion is worth more than a dozen piglets.
*   **B) Gossips...:** Not applicable; the sow is boasting, not necessarily gossiping.
*   **C) Confidence without humility...:** While the sow lacks humility, the core of the retort is about the value of the child, not the sow's character flaw.
*   **D) Set aside disputes...:** This refers to physical danger or conflict, which isn't the focus here.
*   **E) Nurturing is key:** The story is about the inherent nature/quality of the offspring, not the method of upbringing.

The classic moral of this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Lioness and the Sow"") is that one excellent thing is superior to many mediocre things.

morables_179,"Running swiftly, balancing on the razor's edge, bald but with a lock of hair on his forehead, he wears no clothes; if you grasp him from the front, you might be able to hold him, but once he has moved",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the imagery and the metaphor:

1.  **The Physical Description:** The figure (representing Opportunity or *Caerus*) is running swiftly and is bald except for a single lock of hair on his forehead. This implies that if you are facing him, you have something to grab onto.
2.  **The Action:** The text states, ""if you grasp him from the front, you might be able to hold him."" This suggests that taking action immediately as the opportunity approaches is effective.
3.  **The Consequence of Delay:** ""Once he has moved on not even Jupiter himself can pull him back."" This emphasizes that once the moment passes, it is gone forever and cannot be reclaimed, no matter how powerful someone (even the king of the gods) is.
4.  **The Explicit Symbolism:** The text concludes by stating he is a ""symbol of Opportunity, the brief moment in which things are possible.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Seize opportunities when they arise.** This aligns perfectly with the imagery of grabbing the forelock before the figure passes by.
*   **B) Be content with your lot.** This is unrelated to the urgency of the passage.
*   **C) Power without purpose is ineffectual.** While Jupiter's power is mentioned, the focus is on the fleeting nature of time, not the nature of power itself.
*   **D) Boast...** This refers to a completely different set of fables (often Aesop’s fables regarding vanity) and does not apply here.
*   **E) Every daring act teeters...** While ""razor's edge"" is mentioned, the core of the story is about the timing of the grasp, not the vulnerability of the actor.

The story serves as a classic illustration of the proverb ""Take time by the forelock,"" meaning you must act decisively when an opportunity presents itself.

morables_597,"A fox was standing not far from a trap, pondering every possible approach. A nearby wolf noticed the fox and approached her. He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The fox recognizes a danger (the trap) and decides not to risk herself. When the wolf asks for the bait, she uses ""flattery"" and false friendship (""you are one of my very dearest friends"") to encourage the wolf to walk into the trap. Her goal is to test the trap or clear the way using the wolf as a pawn.
2.  **The Wolf's Action:** The wolf trusts the fox's words at face value and acts ""without a moment's hesitation."" He is deceived by the fox's false generosity.
3.  **The Result:** The wolf is injured, and he realizes that the ""gift"" was actually a trap.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Flatterers and deceivers are not to be trusted:** This fits perfectly. The fox uses deceptive kindness to lead the wolf into harm. The story warns that someone offering a ""gift"" with excessive sweetness might have hidden motives.
*   **B) Know yourself and your limits:** This is more relevant to fables like the Crow and the Pitcher or the Tortoise and the Hare.
*   **C) Trust can be a double-edged sword:** While somewhat relevant, it is too vague compared to the specific theme of deception.
*   **D) A single reliable skill is worth more...:** This is the specific moral for ""The Cat and the Fox"" (where the cat has one climbable tree and the fox has a bag of tricks but gets caught).
*   **E) Caution is wise...:** This sounds like modern business advice and doesn't capture the stinging betrayal in the fable.

The core lesson is that one should be wary of the ulterior motives of those who offer seemingly generous gifts or use excessive flattery, as they may be leading you into a trap.

morables_199,"There was a bull who was pastured on a little island. Two dung beetles lived there too, feeding on the bull's manure. Winter was approaching, so one of the dung beetles said to the other, 'I want to g",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the outcome:

1.  **The Promise:** One beetle promises to share his findings with the other if he discovers a good feeding ground on the mainland.
2.  **The Success:** The beetle finds an abundance of fresh manure, eats well, and becomes ""plump and fat.""
3.  **The Failure to Deliver:** Despite his personal success, he returns empty-handed.
4.  **The Excuse:** He blames the ""nature of the place,"" claiming the food was plentiful but physically impossible to bring back.

The conflict arises because the first beetle relied on a promise that was easily made when the beetle was hungry and seeking assistance/agreement, but was not fulfilled once the beetle was satisfied. The plump beetle enjoyed the benefits of the new location but offered only an excuse to his friend.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A) Beware of empty promises made during good times:** This captures the essence of the beetle’s behavior. He made a promise of future benefit, but when he actually found ""good times"" (the abundance of manure), he prioritized his own appetite and provided a convenient excuse rather than fulfilling his word.
- **B, C, D, E:** These do not fit the narrative. There is no fight with a stronger person (B), the story isn't about the discovery itself but the broken promise (C), there is no mention of a work/play balance (D), and while they are dung beetles, the focus isn't on the ""value"" of the discard but on the social interaction between the beetles (E).

Historically, this Aesopic fable (Perry 184) is interpreted as a warning against friends who make grand promises they have no intention of keeping or that circumstances will conveniently prevent them from fulfilling.

When they came to a well, one of them thought that they should jump in immediately, but the other one said, ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** Two frogs are in search of a new home because their current one has dried up. They find a well.
2.  **The Conflict:** One frog wants to jump in immediately (acting on impulse/immediate need). The other frog pauses to consider the long-term consequences.
3.  **The Reasoning:** The second frog realizes that while the well provides water now, if that water dries up (as their previous pond did), the depth of the well would trap them, making it impossible to escape.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the importance of considering potential risks and future outcomes before taking a decisive action.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) Look before you leap:** This is the classic idiom derived from this specific Aesop's fable. It directly addresses the need to evaluate a situation before jumping into it.
*   **B) Watch the actions of your enemy:** There is no enemy in this story.
*   **C) Haste often leads to regret:** While relevant, it is a broader lesson often associated with ""The Tortoise and the Hare."" ""Look before you leap"" is the specific match for the physical action and the logic of the frog story.
*   **D) Impulsive, vicious people...:** This describes the moral of ""The Scorpion and the Frog,"" a different fable.
*   **E) Adaptability is key...:** The frogs are trying to adapt, but the story focuses more on the prudence of their choice rather than the act of adapting itself.

The most accurate and traditional moral for this fable is ""Look before you leap.""

morables_368,"Thanks to his excellent qualities, Hercules was received into heaven. He saluted the gods who came to congratulate him one after another, but when he was approached by Plutus, the god of wealth and th",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **Setting the Scene:** Hercules is admitted to heaven specifically because of his ""excellent qualities"" (his virtue and heroic deeds).
2.  **The Conflict:** Hercules greets all the gods except Plutus (Wealth).
3.  **The Reasoning:** When questioned by Jupiter, Hercules explains his disdain. He views the god of wealth as a ""friend to the wicked"" and a corrupting influence on the world.
4.  **The Lesson:** The contrast is drawn between Hercules (who earned his place through virtue/excellence) and Plutus (who represents material gain that often rewards the unworthy).

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Coffers of cash put a stop to honest traffic in praise:** This option matches the traditional moral assigned to this Aesop's fable (often titled ""Hercules and Plutus""). It suggests that wealth corrupts genuine recognition or integrity.
*   **B) Easy life and seeming good fortune...:** This focuses on a threat to the wealthy person, which isn't the focus here.
*   **C) Wealth cannot buy true excellence:** While true to the story's themes, this is a secondary observation compared to the specific corruption Hercules mentions.
*   **D) Corrupting thieves...:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) Virtue paves the path to the highest rewards:** This describes Hercules' situation, but not the specific point of his interaction with Plutus.

In the context of classical literature and translations of Aesop (such as Phaedrus), the moral of this specific fable is focused on how wealth interferes with honesty and benefits the wicked. Option A directly addresses the ""corruption"" Hercules complains about—how money disrupts the ""honest traffic"" of what should be earned through merit.

morables_301,"A dog made false accusations against the sheep, demanding that she pay him back a loaf of bread which, he insisted, the sheep had supposedly borrowed from him. The dog summoned the wolf as his witness",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"Here is a step-by-step analysis of the fable's moral:

1.  **Analyze the Conflict:** The story begins with a dog and a wolf conspiring to commit perjury. They use false testimony to exploit an innocent sheep, resulting in an unjust legal outcome where the sheep is forced to pay for a debt that never existed.
2.  **Analyze the Resolution:** Shortly after the injustice occurs, the wolf (the false witness) is found dead in a ditch. There is no human or animal intervention mentioned; it is presented as a ""divine"" or natural consequence of his actions.
3.  **Analyze the Message:** The sheep’s concluding remark (""This is the reward that gods give to liars"") explicitly frames the wolf's death as a direct consequence of his dishonesty. This suggests a theme of ""poetic justice"" or ""divine retribution.""
4.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the sheep's observation and the fate of the wolf.
    *   **B:** This refers to discipline or force, which doesn't fit the context of the wolf dying.
    *   **C:** While true in the story, it is an observation of a situation rather than the ultimate lesson taught by the ending.
    *   **D:** This suggests the sheep should have been more assertive, which isn't the focus of the wolf's death.
    *   **E:** This is a modern sociological interpretation, but fables typically focus on the fate of the characters involved.

**Conclusion:** The fable teaches that while liars may succeed in the short term through deception, they eventually face a grim fate as punishment for their wickedness.

'What have I done that I must die?' said she; 'I have stolen neither gold nor silver, but only a grain of corn to satisfy my ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A Lark (the victim) is caught in a snare by a Fowler (the adversary).
2.  **The Plea:** The Lark attempts to argue her innocence and the insignificance of her ""crime"" (eating a single grain of corn). She appeals to logic and justice, noting she hasn't stolen anything valuable like gold or silver.
3.  **The Response:** The Fowler does not engage with her argument. He does not act as a neutral observer but as the person who benefits from her death. He acts as both her captor and her executioner.
4.  **The Outcome:** The Fowler ignores the logic of the plea and proceeds with his intent, showing that when the person you are arguing with is the one who has already decided your fate for their own benefit, words are useless.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The Fowler is the Lark's adversary (he caught her) and her judge (he decides her fate). Her arguments, no matter how logical, are ignored because he is not interested in justice, only his own end.
*   **B:** While the Lark risked her life for corn, the focus of the fable is on the futility of her plea after being caught.
*   **C:** The story shows the opposite; there is no mercy.
*   **D:** This is a convoluted statement that doesn't track with the simple narrative of the Lark's capture and plea.
*   **E:** The story proves the opposite; sincerity was useless in this moment of vulnerability.

Therefore, the moral is that logic and pleas for justice are futile when the person judging you is also the person who stands to gain from your demise.

Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events:

1.  **The Situation:** An old Nurse makes a threat to a child (""I will throw you to the Wolf"") to get the child to be quiet.
2.  **The Misinterpretation:** A Wolf hears this and believes the Nurse's words are a genuine promise. He waits for the ""morsel"" to be delivered.
3.  **The Conflict:** When the child finally cries (the condition for the threat), the Wolf reveals himself, expecting the promise to be fulfilled.
4.  **The Resolution:** The Nurse does not follow through on her word; instead, she calls for the dogs to attack the Wolf.

The Wolf made the mistake of believing a threat/promise made by an ""enemy"" (or someone hostile to his nature). In Aesop's Fables, where this story originates (often titled ""The Nurse and the Wolf""), the central lesson is that one should not trust everything they hear, especially when it comes from an adversary or is said in the heat of the moment. 

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Enemies' promises were made to be broken:** This fits perfectly. The Nurse (the Wolf's enemy/source of threat) made a ""promise"" she never intended to keep, and the Wolf suffered for believing it.
*   **B, C, D:** These do not reflect the interaction between the Nurse's empty threat and the Wolf's disappointment.
*   **E:** While the words were harsh, the core of the fable is about the Wolf's folly in believing the spoken word of a human.

In classic collections of Aesop's fables, the moral is traditionally rendered as: ""Enemies' promises were made to be broken"" or ""Believe not all that you hear.""

Then the fly laughed at the man and said, 'You wanted to avenge the sting of a ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s look at the dialogue and the conflict between the man and the fly:

1.  **The Event:** The man accidentally hits himself while trying to kill a fly.
2.  **The Fly’s Mockery:** The fly mocks the man, suggesting that the ""injury"" (the slap) he gave himself is a punishment for his ""insult"" (attempted murder). The fly implies that the man is foolish for hurting himself in the pursuit of revenge.
3.  **The Man’s Response:** The man makes a distinction between his **intent** and the **outcome**. He forgives himself for the slap because he did not *intend* to hurt himself (""I did not try to hurt myself on purpose""). Conversely, he views the fly as an enemy worth any cost to destroy because the fly *intended* to harm him.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Intent matters more than the outcome:** This is the core of the man’s defense. He justifies his self-injury based on his intention and justifies his hatred of the fly based on its nature and harmful intent.
*   **B)** Unrelated to the text (no sharing involved).
*   **C) Forgiveness outshines mockery:** While he forgives himself, he does not forgive the fly. The story is more about the justification of his actions than the virtue of forgiveness.
*   **D)** ""Forgivingly essential"" is a confusing phrase that doesn't capture the man's logic regarding the fly's malice.
*   **E) In anger, we may cause ourselves more harm:** This is a common interpretation of similar fables, but the text specifically provides the man's rebuttal, shifting the focus to his **conscious reasoning** about intent vs. accident.

The dialogue focuses specifically on the man’s reason for self-forgiveness: the lack of harmful intent toward himself, contrasted with the fly’s inherent malice. This aligns with the classical interpretation of Phaedrus's version of this fable (The Bald Man and the Fly).

1.  **The Conflict:** The Horse wants revenge on the Stag but cannot achieve it alone.
2.  **The Deal:** The Horse seeks help from a Hunter. To gain the Hunter's assistance, the Horse agrees to sacrifice his physical autonomy (the bit, the bridle, and the saddle).
3.  **The Success:** The goal is achieved—the Stag is defeated.
4.  **The Cost:** Once the enemy is gone, the Horse realizes he cannot return to his former state of freedom. By giving the Hunter power over him to achieve a temporary goal, he has entered a permanent state of servitude.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A** captures the transaction: The Hunter helped the Horse for the Horse's purpose, but in doing so, gained the means to use the Horse for his own.
*   **B** is a classic interpretation of this specific Aesop's fable (*The Horse, the Hunter, and the Stag*). It posits that enduring a grievance (the Stag) is preferable to losing one's liberty (to the Hunter).
*   **C** and **D** are less relevant to the specific dynamics of servitude vs. freedom presented here.
*   **E** is a good summary, but it misses the specific element of ""trading"" power for ""revenge/assistance.""

Option **A** is the most precise philosophical summary of the Hunter-Horse relationship. However, in the context of standard literary analysis of this fable, the moral is centered on the danger of trading liberty for revenge. While both A and B are strong interpretations, A more accurately reflects the ""quid pro quo"" nature of the story's climax.

You have such ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Context:** The cat wants the eel that the stork is carrying but does not want to get wet to hunt for its own fish. Thus, the cat resorts to trickery.
2.  **The Attempted Deception:** The cat first tries flattery (""O most beautiful bird!"") to get the stork to open its beak and drop the eel.
3.  **The Stork's Reaction:** The stork recognizes the danger and remains silent to protect its meal. It ignores the flattery.
4.  **The Shift in Tactics:** When flattery fails, the cat turns to insults (""wretched creature,"" ""filthy bird"") to provoke a defensive response from the stork.
5.  **The Resolution:** The stork refuses to be distracted by either the praise or the insults. By staying silent and continuing on its way, the stork successfully keeps its food.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A) Stay focused on your goals:** This matches the stork's behavior perfectly. Despite the cat's attempts to distract or provoke her, she stays focused on keeping her meal and moving forward.
- **B) Do not fear death:** Irrelevant to this story.
- **C) and E) Beauty/Flattery masks intentions:** While true of the cat, the story's resolution focuses on the stork's success in *resisting* these tactics through focus.
- **D) Don't be seduced by cunning words:** While a possible lesson, the story also includes the stork resisting *insults*, which are the opposite of seduction.

The core lesson is that the stork succeeded by remaining silent and ignoring both the ""carrot"" (flattery) and the ""stick"" (insults) to achieve her goal.

'At the moment I am thi",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Opportunity:** The wolf has the dog in a vulnerable position (""sleeping in front of the barn"") and can eat him immediately.
2.  **The Deception:** The dog uses a persuasive promise (the wedding feast) to convince the wolf to wait for a ""better"" meal later.
3.  **The Failure:** Because the wolf waited, he lost his original opportunity. The dog moved to a safe place (the roof) and explicitly told the wolf that he would never be so vulnerable again.

Analysis of the options:
*   **A) Take what you can get when you can get it:** This fits perfectly. The wolf had a meal but gave it up for the promise of a better one. By not taking what was available, he ended up with nothing. This is a classic Aesop-style moral (similar to ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"").
*   **B) Liberty:** The story focuses on survival and wit, not the philosophical value of liberty.
*   **C) The cunning prey on the gullible:** While true, the dog (the prey) is the one being cunning, not the predator.
*   **D) Cunning enemies' persuasive promises...:** This is partially true, but the dog's nature isn't ""predatory"" in this context; he is the intended prey.
*   **E) A plea for mercy...:** The dog's plea didn't just delay the inevitable; it allowed him to escape entirely.

The primary lesson for the wolf (and the reader) is that it is foolish to pass up a certain advantage or reward in the hopes of a greater one later, especially when relying on the word of someone trying to escape you.

morables_222,"A gnat happened to land on the back of a camel and lingered there on top of the baggage. When he finally decided to disembark, he said, 'I will let myself down now as fast as I can so as not to burden",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the interaction between the gnat and the camel step by step:

1.  **The Gnat's Perspective:** The gnat believes his presence is a significant weight upon the camel. He speaks as if he is showing great consideration and mercy by ""unburdening"" the animal, implying that his arrival and departure are events of consequence.
2.  **The Camel's Reality:** The camel, being vastly larger and already carrying a heavy load of baggage, never even felt the gnat. The gnat’s actions had zero impact on the camel’s physical state or awareness.
3.  **The Conflict:** The irony lies in the disparity between the gnat’s self-importance and his actual insignificance in the eyes of the camel.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This directly addresses the theme: the gnat sees himself as ""consequential,"" while to his ""neighbor"" (the camel), he is irrelevant.
*   **B)** While the gnat is arguably arrogant/foolish, the story is specifically about the *perception of importance*, not necessarily ""influence"" in a general sense.
*   **C & D)** These focus on patience or misfortune, which are not the central themes of this specific interaction.
*   **E)** This is a literal observation of the story, but it doesn't capture the ""moral"" (the lesson about human behavior/ego) as well as A does.

The fable is a classic illustration of how unimportant people often overestimate their status or the impact they have on others.

The fox turned to the women and said, 'What shouts there would be aga",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the fox and the women:

1.  **The Situation:** The fox observes women eating roasted chickens in silence. He expresses frustration at what he perceives as a double standard: if he were to eat a chicken, he would be hunted and chased, yet the women do so in peace.
2.  **The Conflict:** The fox equates the *act* of eating the chicken with the *right* to eat the chicken. He feels judged for an action that others perform freely.
3.  **The Resolution:** The old woman points out a fundamental difference: ownership. The women are consuming their own property (""things which are ours""), whereas the fox's consumption involves theft (""things that belong to others"").
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that just because someone is permitted to use or consume their own property, it does not mean a stranger or an outsider has the right to take or use that same property. The context of ownership and legality changes the nature of the action.

*   **Option A** directly addresses this: It warns against concluding that we have the right to treat others' property the way they treat it themselves.
*   **Option B** is irrelevant as there is no friendship described.
*   **Option C and E** focus on the ""silence"" or the ""feast,"" which are atmospheric details rather than the core ethical conflict.
*   **Option D** discusses ""malice"" and ""winks,"" which do not appear in the text.

The moral is that rights of ownership dictate what actions are permissible, and one cannot justify theft by pointing to the owner's legal use of their own goods.

Why are you trying to wound me with your teeth,",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the viper and the file:

1.  **The Characters:** A viper (a creature with venomous biological weapons) and a file (a tool made of hardened metal designed to wear down iron).
2.  **The Action:** The viper attempts to ""bite"" or ""wound"" the file to consume it.
3.  **The Conflict:** The file's nature makes it impervious to teeth. In fact, its purpose is to destroy the very material the viper is attacking it with.
4.  **The Dialogue:** The file calls the viper a ""fool"" because she is attacking something that is far harder and more destructive than herself.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) It is useless attacking the insensible:** In the context of Aesop’s fables, ""insensible"" refers to things that cannot be hurt, moved, or influenced (like cold iron). Attacking something that is fundamentally harder than your weapons—or something that cannot feel your bite—is a futile effort that only hurts the attacker.
*   **B), C), D), and E):** While some contain elements of truth (the viper is foolish/curious), they do not capture the core irony of the fable: attacking something that is inherently superior in strength/resistance to your specific method of attack.

The standard moral associated with this fable (often titled ""The Viper and the File"") is that it is foolish to attack those who can do you more harm than you can do them, or to attack objects that are impervious to your efforts. Option A is the traditional interpretation found in classic collections of the fables.

As they were disputing, they passed a statue carv",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the interaction between the Man and the Lion:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Man and the Lion are arguing over who is superior.
2.  **The Evidence:** The Man points to a statue as ""proof"" of human superiority because it shows a human defeating a lion.
3.  **The Rebuttal:** The Lion points out that the statue is biased because it was created by a human. He suggests that if lions were the ones creating the art, the depiction would be the opposite.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core message is about perspective and bias. The ""truth"" presented by the statue is only one side of the story, shaped by the person who told (or carved) it. It suggests that most accounts of history or superiority are biased toward the one telling the tale.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) One story is good, till another is told:** This directly addresses the idea that a single perspective seems convincing until the opposing perspective is presented. This is the classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable.
*   **B, C, D, E:** While these deal with ""pride"" or ""bravery,"" they do not touch upon the specific twist of the story—the bias of the creator/narrator.

The story teaches us that we should question the source of information, as the ""winner"" is usually the one who writes the history.

On his way to the assembly of the birds, the peaco",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the motivations of the characters:

1.  **The Motivation:** The peacock is described as gentle and courteous, but he agrees to give away his feathers specifically in exchange for **praise** (""I will squawk your praises""). This indicates that his actions are driven by a desire for validation and status (vanity).
2.  **The Action:** He continues to give away his vital resources (his feathers) to various birds (the raven, crow, cuckoo) in exchange for this social recognition.
3.  **The Consequence:** By giving away what was physically necessary for his survival and the protection of his offspring for the sake of being praised, he leaves himself vulnerable.
4.  **The Result:** He is unable to perform his duties as a parent, cannot survive the winter, and ultimately dies.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Vanity can lead to self-destruction:** This fits perfectly. The peacock's desire to be praised (vanity) caused him to give away his means of survival, leading directly to his death.
*   **B) Do not boast to have something you do not:** The peacock actually had the feathers, so this is not applicable.
*   **C) Opportunism can overshadow courtesy:** While the other birds were opportunistic, the story's focus is on the peacock's choice and the terminal consequence of his actions.
*   **D) Sorrow not over what is abandoned:** This is a lesson on resilience, but the peacock died and failed his chicks, so it doesn't fit.
*   **E) True beauty shines through kindness:** The story actually shows that the peacock's ""kindness"" (or rather, his need for praise) led to a tragic end, making this an unlikely moral.

The peacock sacrificed his survival for the sake of his ego and reputation, which is the definition of vanity leading to destruction.

You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth as a w",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events:
1.  **The Context:** A small Gnat challenges a powerful Lion, claiming superior strength.
2.  **The Conflict:** The Gnat successfully defeats the Lion by exploiting the Lion's inability to fight a tiny, flying foe, causing the Lion to injure himself.
3.  **The Aftermath:** The Gnat, filled with pride and triumph, flies away while ""buzzing about in a song of triumph.""
4.  **The Irony:** Overwhelmed by his own victory and lack of vigilance (or perhaps simply by the fickle nature of fate), he flies directly into a common spiderweb and is eaten by a minor predator.
5.  **The Lament:** The Gnat realizes the absurdity of defeating the ""hugest beasts"" only to be killed by an ""inconsiderable"" spider.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) No matter how you brag, you can be undone.** This captures the essence of the story: triumph over a great foe does not grant invulnerability, and boasting often precedes a downfall.
*   **B) Do not ever trust your enemy...** This fits ""The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing"" or similar fables, but not this one.
*   **C) Pride can turn triumph into frustration.** While close, ""frustration"" is too mild for ""death by spider.""
*   **D) Boastful cunning often outwits its frustrated self.** This describes the Lion's frustration, but doesn't capture the Gnat's ultimate fate.
*   **E) True strength is not always visible.** This applies to the first half (the Gnat vs. Lion) but ignores the second half (the Gnat vs. Spider).

The core lesson is that the Gnat's pride and boasting (bragging) blinded him to lesser dangers, leading to his undoing immediately after his greatest victory. This aligns most closely with Option A.

morables_361,"Some fishermen had gone out fishing, and when they had struggled for a long time but had not managed to catch anything, they became very downcast and prepared to turn back. All of a sudden a tuna fish",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Effort:** The fishermen are skilled workers who put in a great deal of effort (""struggled for a long time"").
2.  **The Failure of Skill:** Despite their hard work and professional skills, they caught nothing and were ready to give up.
3.  **The Event:** A tuna fish literally jumps into their boat, not because of their fishing techniques, but because it was fleeing a predator. 
4.  **The Result:** They achieved their goal (catching a fish) through a stroke of pure chance rather than through their labor or expertise.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A:** Directly addresses the contrast between ""skill"" (the fishermen's struggle) and ""luck"" (the fish leaping into the boat). This matches the traditional Aesop's fable moral for this specific story.
*   **B:** While the tuna was fleeiing a ""bigger fish,"" the story focuses on the fishermen's success through chance, not the safety of being small.
*   **C:** This describes the change in emotion, but it isn't a ""moral lesson"" or a universal truth taught by the narrative action.
*   **D:** This appears to be nonsensical phrasing.
*   **E:** The fishermen actually gave up and ""prepared to turn back""; they did not succeed because they persevered, but because they were lucky.

The story illustrates that sometimes outcomes are determined by fortune or luck rather than human effort or calculation.

Not withstanding all his prayers, instead of becoming richer, he got poorer. Out ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Devotion:** The man prays faithfully and patiently to a wooden idol, hoping for a reward (wealth).
2.  **The Failure:** Despite his piety, his situation worsens. The ""divine"" entity does not respond to traditional worship or prayer.
3.  **The Violence/Change in Action:** The man loses patience and destroys the idol—an act that would traditionally be seen as sacrilegious or impious.
4.  **The Reward:** It is only through the destruction of the idol (the rejection of his former worship) that he actually obtains the gold he sought.
5.  **The Conclusion:** The man realizes that his former worship was a waste of time and that the ""deity"" only yielded results when treated with force and pragmatism.

**Analysis of the Options:**
- **A) People adjust their beliefs based on what is profitable for them:** This aligns with the man's final exclamation. He immediately discards his reverence and labels the deity ""graceless"" once he realizes that violence, not prayer, yielded the profit. His ""belief"" or ""worship"" was dictated by the outcome.
- **B) Only a man who is out of his mind...:** This does not fit the narrative, as the man's actions led to a successful outcome.
- **C) Impatience can lead to graceless outcomes:** The outcome was actually very grace-ful (he got rich); his impatience was what finally solved his problem.
- **D) Impatient opposites...:** This is nonsensical in the context of the story.
- **E) Fortune favors the bold...:** While somewhat applicable, the specific irony of the fable (common in Aesop's fables of this type) focuses on the fickle nature of the man's devotion and the pragmatic shift in his attitude toward the ""god"" based on the gold he received.

Historically, this specific Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Man and the Wooden God"") carries the moral that some people are so perverse or worldly that they only respond to ""force"" or ""interest"" rather than ""prayer,"" and similarly, many people's ""faith"" is entirely dependent on whether it pays off.

Then the little gnat said to the bull, 'It's enough for me that you have accepted my ch",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Interaction:** A tiny gnat challenges a massive bull. These two are nowhere near equals in strength or stature.
2.  **The Gnat's Strategy:** The gnat does not actually fight. Instead, it claims victory simply because the bull *accepted* the challenge. By agreeing to compete, the bull acknowledge the gnat as a legitimate rival.
3.  **The Result:** The gnat gains status and boasting rights, while the bull gains nothing and looks foolish for even acknowledging such a small opponent.
4.  **The Explicit Lesson:** The text states that if the bull had been ""mindful of his own mighty bulk,"" he would have ignored the gnat. By engaging, he allowed the ""impertinent creature"" to elevate itself to his level.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the text. By accepting the challenge, the bull lowers his reputation to the level of the gnat.
*   **B:** Irrelevant (mentions children and arts).
*   **C:** While the gnat is proud/boastful, the story is focused more on the bull’s mistake in engaging with an unworthy foe rather than a ""downfall"" caused by vanity.
*   **D:** Nonsensical in the context of the story.
*   **E:** While somewhat true, it misses the specific nuance that the *engagement itself* confers an unearned status upon the inferior party.

The fable teaches that those of high status or great ability should not dignify petty provocations, as doing so validates the instigator.

The owner began to question the dog, asking how he could be so ungra",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue between the owner and the dog.

1.  **The Context:** The owner claims to be kind because he personally never hit or spoke harshly to the dog. He uses this ""hands-off"" approach to argue that he is a good master and that the dog is ungrateful for running away.
2.  **The Dog's Rebuttal:** The dog points out that while the owner did not physically strike him, the owner ordered others to do so. In the dog's eyes, the source of the order is the one responsible for the pain.
3.  **The Core Lesson:** The story critiques the idea that a person can escape moral responsibility for an action just by delegating it to someone else. If you order a punishment, you are as guilty as the one who carries it out.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) What a person does through another is truly their own action.** This directly reflects the dog's point: being beaten ""by your order"" is the same as being beaten ""by you.""
*   **B) There is danger lurking in the words of a wicked person.** While the owner is hypocritical, the story focus is on delegated actions, not ""danger"" or ""wicked words.""
*   **C) Kindness is often unappreciated.** This is the owner's flawed perspective, which the story ultimately refutes.
*   **D) Better to face a known danger...** This is irrelevant to the plot of the story.
*   **E) Distinctive traits can lead to unexpected reunions.** This describes a plot point (the ""bob-tail"" and markings), but it is not the ""moral"" or the philosophical lesson of the dialogue.

The moral is that delegating a task does not absolve the initiator of the responsibility.

Even when they saw one of",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the characters' reactions:

1.  **Initial Situation**: A butcher enters a flock of sheep. The sheep are aware of his presence but choose to ignore the danger because it isn't immediate to *every* individual.
2.  **The Turning Point**: As the butcher takes the sheep one by one, the survivors remain passive, thinking only of their own temporary safety (""He keeps his hands off me""). They fail to realize that the threat to one is eventually a threat to all.
3.  **The Conclusion**: When only one sheep remains, it realizes that their passivity and lack of solidarity led to their demise. The sheep acknowledges that if they had stood together and fought back when they had the strength of numbers, they could have stopped the butcher.

**Analysis of Choices**:
*   **A) If you don't speak out for others, there will be nobody left to speak out for you.** This mirrors the famous sentiment expressed by Martin Niemöller regarding the Holocaust. The sheep's failure to protect their peers resulted in their own isolation and eventual death.
*   **B)** This refers to choosing the ""lesser of two evils,"" which isn't the focus here.
*   **C)** While the sheep eventually faces the truth, the core of the story is about collective action and the consequences of indifference.
*   **D)** This is unrelated to the plot.
*   **E)** The sheep weren't trying to ""fit in"" with the mighty; they were ignoring a predator.

The story serves as a warning against apathy and the failure to act in solidarity against a common threat. The sheep's individualism and refusal to intervene when their neighbors were taken led to their total destruction.

1.  **The Action:** A hooligan commits a reckless, aggressive act by hitting Aesop with a stone.
2.  **The Reinforcement:** Instead of punishing him immediately, Aesop rewards him with a coin. This creates a false sense of security and validation.
3.  **The Escalation:** Believing his ""success"" (getting a coin) is a repeatable pattern, the hooligan repeats the action against a more powerful figure.
4.  **The Consequence:** The hooligan is caught and executed.

The central theme is that the hooligan was emboldened by his initial ""success"" (getting a reward for a bad deed). This success blinded him to the danger of his actions and led him directly to his downfall. In the context of Phaedrus's fables (from which this version is derived), the moral is specifically that early rewards for bad behavior tempt a person into repeating that behavior against the wrong target, resulting in ruin.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Success leads many astray to their ruin:** This matches the narrative. The hooligan found ""success"" with Aesop, which led him to his ultimate ruin.
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for:** This doesn't fit, as the hooligan wasn't wishing for something specific that backfired.
*   **C) Clever minds outwit reckless wealth:** Aesop is clever, but the hooligan represents reckless aggression, not reckless wealth.
*   **D) Avoid reckless overindulgence in manipulative pursuits:** This is too wordy and misses the point of the ""reward"" leading to ruin.
*   **E) Responding with grace can disarm hostility:** Aesop didn't respond with grace to disarm; he responded with a trick to ensure the boy was punished by someone else.

In classical translations of this specific fable, the moral is often stated as: ""Success leads many astray to their ruin,"" because a reward for a crime encourages a person to repeat it until they face a consequence they cannot survive.

morables_584,"Winter made fun of Spring and mocked her for the fact that as soon as spring appears, nobody can keep still: some people go off to the meadows or into the woods, others like to gather flowers and lili",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the dialogue between the two personified seasons:

1.  **Winter's perspective:** Winter boasts about its strength and authority. It compares itself to a ""dictator or a despot"" because it forces people to stay indoors, makes them tremble with fear, and dictates their behavior through harsh conditions.
2.  **Spring's perspective:** Spring argues that Winter’s style of ""leadership"" (the use of fear and restriction) makes people want to ""get rid of"" it. In contrast, Spring brings joy and freedom, causing people to look forward to its arrival and remember it fondly when it is gone.
3.  **The Comparison:** The fable contrasts two ways of exerting influence: one through intimidation and force (Winter), and one through beauty and benevolence (Spring). 

While Winter sees its ability to frighten people as a sign of power, Spring points out that this power is resented. True influence and lasting appreciation come from being a source of happiness rather than a source of fear. This aligns directly with the idea that being loved is a superior state to being feared, as it fosters loyalty and gratitude rather than a desire for escape.

- **Option A** captures this core conflict between respect through love versus compliance through fear.
- **Option B** is incorrect as there is no misplaced blame.
- **Option C** is a general observation but not the ""lesson"" or ""moral"" the retort provides.
- **Option D** focuses on talent and appreciation, but the story is more about the nature of authority.
- **Option E** is a modern sentiment, but the fable explicitly portrays Winter as something people want to be rid of, rather than finding its unique beauty.

Therefore, the lesson is that a benevolent presence is preferred over a tyrannical one.

Everyone wondered at this, since the new horse was neithe",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the behavior of the characters and the narrative outcome:

1.  **The Situation:** A soldier possesses an ""excellent"" and ""useful"" horse. He buys a second horse that is objectively ""not nearly as good"" and lacks the beauty and utility of the first.
2.  **The Action:** Despite the second horse being inferior, the soldier gives it ""more care"" than the first one.
3.  **The Reaction:** Observers are confused because the preference doesn't align with the quality of the horses.
4.  **The Explanation:** The observer notes that it is ""natural to be fond of the newest arrival."" This implies a human tendency to prioritize novelty over established value or merit.
5.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A:** While the story notes the appeal of the ""newest arrival,"" it doesn't explicitly show the soldier losing interest over time (though it is implied by the nature of novelty). However, this is more of a cynical observation than the central irony of the story.
    *   **B:** The story has nothing to do with disaster or being satisfied with one's lot.
    *   **C:** The story shows the soldier ignoring both beauty and usefulness in favor of novelty.
    *   **D:** There is no ""wicked man"" or verbal trust involved.
    *   **E:** This captures the core irony: the soldier is investing care and value into something ""less worthy"" (the inferior horse) while neglecting what ""truly deserves"" care (the excellent horse).

The fable serves as a critique of how humans often irrionally favor novelty or inferior things over proven, superior ones.

morables_423,"A seagull having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die. A Kite saw him and exclaimed: 'You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no bus",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Event:** A seagull (a bird of the air) attempts to eat something that is physically beyond its capacity (too large a fish/from the sea). 
2.  **The Consequence:** The seagull suffers a fatal injury because of its attempt to venture outside its natural limits or ""business.""
3.  **The Commentary:** The Kite points out that the seagull deserved its fate because it sought food from a domain (the sea) that was not its intended place (being a bird of the air).

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Every man should be content to mind his own business.** This aligns with the historical and traditional moral of this Aesop's fable. It suggests that individuals should stay within their own sphere and not meddle in matters (or environments) for which they are not suited.
*   **B) Learn from past misfortunes.** The seagull dies, so it cannot learn from its misfortune.
*   **C) Greed breeds misfortune...** While the seagull was ""greedy"" in bolting a large fish, the specific commentary from the Kite focuses on the *nature* or *domain* of the bird rather than just the volume of food.
*   **D) How often do we supply our unfortunate enemies...** This moral usually applies to fables like ""The Eagle and the Arrow.""
*   **E) Patience is key...** This is irrelevant to the seagull's physical overextension.

In the context of Aesop's fables, this specific story (The Kite and the Seagull) is traditionally used to illustrate that one should stay in their own lane or sphere of expertise.

morables_145,"There were once some foxes who had gathered together on the banks of the River Meander looking for a drink of water. They urged one another to approach the river, but no one dared to get too close bec",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the characters' motivations:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of foxes is thirsty, but the river is dangerous.
2.  **The Action:** One fox decides to prove she is superior to the others. Her motivation is not simply to drink, but to ""embarrass her fellow foxes"" and prove she is ""braver than the rest.""
3.  **The Consequence:** Because she acts out of boastful pride rather than caution, she is swept away by the current.
4.  **The Reaction:** When her companions call out to her, she makes up a face-saving excuse (pretending she intended to go downstream to Miletus) to hide the fact that she has lost control and is in danger.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The fox's need to boast and show off led her to jump into a dangerous current, resulting in her being swept away.
*   **B:** There is no ""profit"" or greed involved; it is about bravado.
*   **C:** Higher boldness did not quench her thirst; it put her life at risk.
*   **D:** The ""bad neighbors"" (the other foxes) are safe on the bank; the boastful fox is the one suffering.
*   **E:** The story portrays the ""courageous"" action as foolhardy and motivated by ego, not wisdom.

The fable (often attributed to Aesop) illustrates that those who boast and put themselves in danger just to show off often end up in a predicament they cannot escape, frequently trying to hide their failure with more lies.

morables_251,"When the lion made himself king of the beasts, he wanted to be known for his fairness, so he gave up his old habits and contented himself with a limited diet just as the other animals did, committed t",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the interactions between the lion and the other animals:

1.  **The Lion's Dilemma**: The lion wants to maintain a facade of ""fairness"" and ""justice"" while satisfying his natural predatory hunger. 
2.  **The Strategy of the Breath**: He begins by asking animals if his breath smells.
    *   Those who answer ""Yes"" (honesty) are killed.
    *   Those who answer ""No"" (flattery/denial) are killed.
    *   This demonstrates that the specific content of the answer does not save them; the lion's predatory nature outweighs his pretense of justice.
3.  **The Case of the Monkey**: The monkey tries extreme flattery (""smelled of cinnamon""). Even though the lion feels a momentary shame, he simply invents a different excuse (pretending to be sick and needing ""light"" meat) to eat the monkey anyway.
4.  **Conclusion**: Regardless of whether the animals were honest, dishonest, or excessively complimentary, their fate remained the same because the lion (the powerful) was determined to satisfy his appetite.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A** highlights the futility of speech when dealing with a predator/tyrant. This aligns with the lion killing those who said ""yes,"" ""no,"" and finally the monkey who used extreme flattery.
*   **B** is irrelevant as there are no ""old friends"" mentioned.
*   **C** suggests flattery masks intentions, but in this story, the lion's intentions are clear to him, and it is the *flattery* that fails to save the monkey.
*   **D** focus on ""disclosing a fool,"" which doesn't fit the lion's calculated move.
*   **E** is a ""pro-integrity"" statement that the story actually subverts (the lion's integrity is a lie).

The core lesson is that when a predator is determined to harm you, the nature of your speech (truth vs. flattery) often makes no difference in the outcome. In many classical collections of Aesop's fables, this specific story (or variations like it) concludes with the realization that for those in power with bad intentions, no answer is the ""right"" answer.

The partridge immediately started squawking his usual song, sauntering through every room in the house un",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the partridge and the weasel step by step:

1.  **The Context:** A partridge is newly introduced to a household. He immediately behaves as if he owns the place, walking through every room and ""squawking his usual song"" loudly.
2.  **The Encounter:** The weasel, an established resident of the house, confronts the bird. The weasel points out their difference in seniority: the weasel was born there and has lived there a long time, yet remains quiet and respectful (""sleep beside the hearth"").
3.  **The Lesson:** The weasel’s rebuke focuses on the partridge's lack of humility and failure to observe the established order or ""quiet"" nature of the home as a newcomer. The partridge is acting with entitlement (""speak so freely and cackle so loudly"") despite being there for only a day.
4.  **Evaluation of Options:**
    *   **A:** This fits perfectly. The story emphasizes that a newcomer should observe and respect the existing environment rather than imposing their own noise and will immediately.
    *   **B:** Irrelevant to the plot.
    *   **C:** The story doesn't show the partridge outsmarting anyone; in fact, the weasel (a predator) is the one questioning him.
    *   **D:** While the partridge is vain, the focus is specifically on his status as a newcomer vs. an old inhabitant.
    *   **E:** Not the central theme.

The story teaches that someone new to a group or place should not be overly bold or loud, but should instead learn the customs and wait to earn their place.

Stung by the sharp pain,",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A fox is in trouble (slipping) and reaches out for help to stabilize herself.
2.  **The Action:** The fox grabs a bramble bush. By its very nature, a bramble bush is covered in thorns and ""grabs"" or pricks anything that touches it.
3.  **The Consequence:** The fox is injured by the thorns and complains about the bush's ""cruelty.""
4.  **The Resolution/Dialogue:** The bramble bush points out the fox's folly: the fox expected safety/help from something whose fundamental nature is to be prickly and hurtful.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A)** This aligns with the dialogue. The fox sought help from a bush that naturally hurts things. Expecting a ""grabby,"" thorny plant to provide a soft landing is foolish.
*   **B)** This refers to ""boasting,"" which does not occur in this fable.
*   **C)** While the fox felt pain, the story is more about the irony of the fox's choice than the nature of cruelty itself.
*   **D)** This refers to another of Aesop's fables (The Fox and the Cat), regarding ""tricks.""
*   **E)** This is a plausible secondary lesson, but the classical moral of this specific fable (often titled ""The Fox and the Bramble"") focuses on the mistake of the seeker choosing an ill-suited source of help based on that source's known character.

The core lesson is that you cannot blame someone for hurting you if it is in their nature to do so, and it is a mistake to rely on those who are naturally antagonistic or harmful.

But the fuller told him, 'How on earth would I be able to carr",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the roles and interaction of the characters:

1.  **The Characters:** A **charcoal burner** (whose trade involves black soot and carbon) and a **fuller** (a person who cleans and whitens cloth).
2.  **The Conflict:** The charcoal burner wants to share a home for convenience or companionship. The fuller refuses because his profession requires absolute cleanliness, while the charcoal burner’s profession is inherently messy/dirty.
3.  **The Reasoning:** The fuller realizes that the charcoal burner's lifestyle/work would actively undo or ruin his own work. If they lived together, the soot would inevitably stain the white cloth.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that people with fundamentally different and conflicting natures or goals cannot coexist successfully in a shared arrangement. Their ""opposites"" are not just different; they are destructive to one another.

Evaluating the options:
- **A) Opposites are utterly incompatible:** This fits the literal and metaphorical meaning perfectly. The black soot and white cloth represent natures that cannot mix without one ruining the other.
- **B, C, D, E:** While elements of ""caution"" or ""understanding"" are present, they do not capture the core irony of the two specific trades mentioned in Aesop's fable.

The traditional moral of this fable (often titled ""The Charcoal-Burner and the Fuller"") is that like should associate with like, and that incompatible lifestyles lead to disaster.

Some travellers coming from the opposite direction asked the man how he",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Action:** A murderer attempts to escape justice by lying about the blood on his hands, claiming it came from a mulberry tree (referencing the red sap or fruit/stain of a mulberry).
2.  **The Betrayal:** By blaming the tree for the ""stain,"" the murderer attempts to slander an innocent entity to hide his own guilt.
3.  **The Retribution:** The murderer is caught and executed on that very tree. 
4.  **The Tree's Statement:** The tree explicitly states that it is happy to assist in the execution because the man tried to ""smear"" (slander) it with his own crime.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the tree's dialogue. The tree (representing an ""honest"" or innocent party) does not hesitate to facilitate the punishment of the person who slandered it.
*   **B:** Equanimity (calmness) is not the focus; the tree is actively resentful of the slander.
*   **C:** While curiosity of the travelers led to the lie, the climax and the ""voice"" of the moral come from the tree's reaction to the slander.
*   **D:** This is a common moral for other Aesopic fables (like the Stag and his Antlers), but the murderer wasn't seeking ""honour"" through the mulberry tree; he was seeking an excuse.
*   **E:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific irony of the tree’s participation in the execution.

In traditional collections of Aesop's Fables (Perry Index 170), the epimythium (moral) specifically focuses on how those who are slandered/harmed by the wicked will not hesitate to turn against them when the truth comes to light.

The lion woke up and immediately grabbed the wretched little mouse with his paw,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events:

1.  **The setup:** A powerful creature (the lion) shows mercy to a weak creature (the mouse) despite the mouse being seemingly insignificant.
2.  **The turning point:** The lion, despite his strength, becomes helpless when trapped by hunters.
3.  **The resolution:** The mouse, whom the lion spared, uses his specific skills (gnawing) to save the lion’s life.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted:** This aligns perfectly with the narrative. The lion's ""small"" act of kindness (sparing a tiny mouse) resulted in his own life being saved later. It highlights that even the smallest being can repay a debt of gratitude.
*   **B) Unequal matches bring misery:** The story shows the opposite; the ""unequal match"" between the lion and mouse brought salvation, not misery.
*   **C) Cleverness can free the trapped:** While the mouse was clever/skilled, the core message is about the *repayment of a favor* (mercy/kindness), not just problem-solving.
*   **D) Those who act in their own innocent self-interest...:** The mouse was acting out of genuine gratitude (""I have not forgotten the kindness...""), not self-interest.
*   **E) Even the smallest actions can awaken great consequences:** While technically true (running over the lion's paw had the consequence of him being caught), this is a generic observation. The specific *moral* lesson of Aesop’s fable is about mercy and the value of small friends.

The tradition of this fable (Aesop's *The Lion and the Mouse*) concludes that mercy is rewarded and that even the small and weak can help the great and powerful.

1.  **The Situation:** The Pigeons are afraid of a Kite (a bird of prey), which represents a moderate or external threat.
2.  **The Action:** To solve this problem, they seek help from a Hawk (a much more formidable predator) and invite him into their home (the cote).
3.  **The Outcome:** The Hawk, while technically ""defending"" them from the Kite, ends up killing more Pigeons in a single day than the Kite would have in a year.
4.  **The Lesson:** The solution the Pigeons chose to solve their problem was far more destructive than the original problem itself.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The ""remedy"" (the Hawk) was significantly more lethal than the ""disease"" (the Kite).
*   **B), C), and D):** While these contain elements of wisdom, they don't capture the specific irony of a self-destructive solution.
*   **E):** While relevant, it is more of a generalized observation. Option A is the classical interpretation of this specific Aesop’s fable (""The Pigeons and the Hawk"").

The primary takeaway is that one must be careful not to create a bigger problem while trying to solve a smaller one.

At first, the Earth refused to cooperate in Herm",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Directive:** Zeus creates humans and intends for them to survive by farming/digging into the Earth.
2.  **The Conflict:** The Earth (Gaia) initially resists, likely because the act of digging is a violation or a burden upon her.
3.  **The Resolution:** Hermes uses the authority of Zeus to force Gaia to comply.
4.  **The Consequence (The Moral Core):** Gaia relents but adds a curse or a condition: humans may take what they need from her, but it will come at the cost of ""groans and tears."" This explains that human survival and the extraction of resources (agriculture/labor) are inherently painful and difficult.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Easy gains often come with hidden costs and hardships:** The story illustrates that sustenance (the ""gain"") is not free; it requires labor and suffering (""groans and tears""). This matches the theme of the ""cost"" of living.
*   **B) Do not fight with those who are perfectly capable of fighting back:** While Gaia threatens humans, the focus is more on the inevitable toil of life rather than a warning against picking fights.
*   **C) Power can sway the reluctant:** This describes the interaction between Hermes/Zeus and Gaia, but Aesop’s fables usually focus on the human condition or a universal truth regarding the outcome for the protagonists (humans).
*   **D) Powerful physical stature does not guarantee wisdom:** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **E) Guidance is the seed of self-sufficiency:** While Hermes guides them, the story ends on an ominous note about pain, not a positive note about independence.

Option **A** is the most accurate reflection of the ""price"" Gaia demands for the resources she provides.

So if you eve",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Event:** A dog successfully steals meat (a heart) from a butcher. This is an act of opportunism and robbery.
2.  **The Butcher's Reaction:** Instead of being purely angry, the butcher acknowledges the loss but gains something metaphysical. He says he has ""taken heart from this lesson."" This means he has learned to be more vigilant and aware of the dog's nature.
3.  **The Warning:** The butcher warns that because he is now aware (has ""taken heart"" or gained courage and wisdom from the experience), the dog will not succeed again and will instead face punishment.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Experience teaches valuable lessons and encourages caution:** This aligns perfectly with the butcher's dialogue. He explicitly states that the event was a ""lesson"" and that his future behavior will change to be more cautious/prepared.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** While the dog's nature was revealed, the focus of the fable's punchline is on the butcher's newfound wisdom.
*   **C) Boldness without caution leads astray:** This focuses on the dog, but the dog actually succeeded in the theft; the moral center is the butcher's reaction.
*   **D) and E):** These themes (deceitful safety or betrayal of trust) are not the primary focus of the interactions in this specific text.

The core of the story is the transformation of a negative experience (theft) into a protective lesson for the future.

When he saw a hard-working bull who was pulling a plow, the bullock said to him, 'You poor",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Mockery:** The young bullock, who has lived a life of leisure and avoided work, mocks the older bull for his hard labor and suffering under the yoke.
2.  **The Stoic Response:** The older bull ignores the insult and keeps working, enduring the burden that the younger bull avoids.
3.  **The Reversal of Fortune:** When the time for sacrifice comes, the hardworking bull is rewarded with rest and pasture because he is useful for labor. The idle bullock, having been kept fat and ""free"" from work, is revealed to have been spared labor only so he could be slaughtered for a sacrifice.
4.  **The Final Word:** The older bull points out that the leisure the bullock enjoyed was actually a precursor to a much worse fate (death).

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) He laughs best that laughs last:** This fits perfectly. The bullock laughed at the bull's ""misery"" early on, but in the end, it is the bull who survives while the bullock meets a grim fate. The final ""laugh"" or moral victory belongs to the one who endured.
*   **B) The great do not always prevail:** This does not fit; the ""great"" (the elder/stronger bull) actually does ""prevail"" by surviving.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers youthful naivety:** While true in a general sense, the story focuses specifically on the reversal of status/mockery.
*   **D) He that is neither...:** This is a nonsensical phrasing that doesn't apply.
*   **E) One should not judge others...:** This is a secondary lesson, but it misses the ""lethal"" irony of the bullock's idleness.

In Aesopic tradition, this fable (often titled ""The Bull and the Bullock"") serves as a warning that idleness or a lack of responsibility often leads to a more dangerous end than hard work. The reversal of the initial mockery makes ""He laughs best that laughs last"" the most appropriate summary.

morables_174,It is common to take Maltese dogs and pet monkeys on long sea voyages in order to relieve the boredom of the passage. A man who was planning to make such a voyage had brought his monkey along with him,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A monkey is saved by a dolphin during a shipwreck because the dolphin mistakes him for a human.
2.  **The Pretense:** During their conversation, the monkey lies about his origins (claiming to be from an illustrious Athenian family) to seem more important than he is.
3.  **The Mistake:** When asked about Piraeus (the harbor), the monkey mistakenly thinks it is a person and claims it is a ""dear friend.""
4.  **The Consequence:** The dolphin realizes the monkey is a liar. Because of this deception, the dolphin stops helping him and drowns him.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The monkey pretended to be something he wasn't (a high-class Athenian human) and ended up in ""deep water"" (both literally and figuratively) because of his lies.
*   **B:** The story is about a single monkey and a single dolphin; it doesn't contrast one man against a crowd.
*   **C:** The monkey's plan (lying) actually caused infuriation, it didn't calm it.
*   **D:** While the dolphin was dangerous when infuriated, the core lesson is about the danger of lying/pretending, not the definition of truth.
*   **E:** Companionship failed here specifically because the monkey was dishonest.

The fable teaches that boastful liars eventually get caught and suffer for their deception.

morables_25,"A Certain House was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this, made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Conflict:** A Cat is hunting Mice. After the Cat successfully eats several Mice, the remaining Mice realize the danger and stay hidden in their holes for safety.
2.  **The Strategy:** The Cat, unable to reach the Mice, resorts to a trick (deception) by pretending to be dead, hanging from a peg.
3.  **The Resolution:** The Mice, having already witnessed the Cat's true nature and lethality, are not fooled. One Mouse notes that even if the Cat transformed into something harmless (like a meal-bag), they would still not trust her.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Mice are cautious because they have already been ""deceived"" or harmed by the Cat once. They have learned from their past experience that the Cat is their enemy, and as a result, they exercise double caution against any new tricks she tries to play.

Evaluating the options:
- **A) He who is once deceived is doubly cautious:** This fits perfectly. The Mice were previously victimized by the Cat, and because of that experience, they are now extremely wary of her, even when she appears harmless.
- **B) Beware of when the powerful and the deceitful collaborate:** There is no collaboration in this story; it is a solo effort by the Cat.
- **C) Caution tempers cunning:** While the Mice's caution defeats the Cat's cunning, this is a less common way to phrase the specific lesson of learning from past deception.
- **D) Relying too much on cunning subordinates...:** There are no subordinates in the story.
- **E) Unchecked problems...:** This describes the beginning of the story (the mice overrunning the house) but ignore the central interaction and the conclusion.

The classic moral for this Aesop's fable (*The Cat and the Mice*) is that those who are once caught or nearly caught by a trickster will not be fooled by them a second time.

Just as he was about to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and wak",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the situation provided in the fable:

1.  **The Situation:** A traveler falls asleep on the ""very brink of a deep well."" This is a dangerous situation caused by his own lack of caution or poor judgment.
2.  **The Interaction:** Dame Fortune (the personification of luck or fate) wakes him up. She does not do this out of pure benevolence, but to protect her own reputation.
3.  **The Message:** She explicitly states that if he had fallen in, people would have blamed ""Fortune"" (bad luck) for the accident, even though it would have been caused ""by their own folly.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that people often blame external circumstances or ""fate"" for misfortunes that are actually the result of their own careless actions. Therefore, the lesson is that individuals are responsible for their own outcomes and are the masters of their own fates.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Everyone is more or less master of his own fate.** (This matches the message that we shouldn't blame Fortune for our own folly).
*   **B) Every tale is not to be believed.** (Irrelevant to the plot).
*   **C) Guard your energy wisely.** (While the man was tired, the story focuses on the blame/responsibility aspect).
*   **D) He who incites to concerned strife...** (Irrelevant).
*   **E) Exhaustion can lead to perilous oversight.** (While true within the story, it is a literal observation rather than the thematic moral addressed by Dame Fortune).

In Aesop's fables, this specific story (""The Traveler and Fortune"") is traditionally used to illustrate that we are responsible for our own misfortunes.

The man took the handle and fitted it to his axe. The",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Request:** A man creates an axe head (a tool meant for cutting) and asks his potential victims (the trees) for the means to use it (a handle).
2.  **The Action:** The trees willingly provide the man with the hardest wood (the olive), enabling his tool to become functional.
3.  **The Consequence:** Once the man has the handle, he immediately uses the completed axe to destroy the very trees that assisted him.
4.  **The Realization:** The oak tree recognizes that their own contribution—providing the handle—enabled their destruction.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A:** Focusing on giving an enemy the means to harm you is the direct lesson here. By providing the handle, the trees armed their own destroyer.
*   **B:** While the trees are being injured, ""with impunity"" means without punishment; this doesn't fit the context of self-inflicted harm well.
*   **C:** This is a plausible summary, but A is a more specific and traditional interpretation of this specific Esop's fable (""The Woodman and the Trees"").
*   **D:** This suggests they were forced; however, the story explicitly says the trees ""selected the wood,"" implying a voluntary, albeit foolish, choice.
*   **E:** This is irrelevant to the themes of betrayal and shortsightedness in the story.

The core lesson is that one should not provide an adversary with the tools or resources they need to cause harm. By assisting the man in completing his weapon, the trees sealed their own fate.

morables_527,"The crab's mother said to him, 'My son, why do you walk in a crooked line when you should be walking straight ahead?' The crab said to her, 'O mother, lead the way, and I will try to walk accordingly.",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s break down the story step by step:

1.  **The Premise:** A mother crab criticizes her son for walking sideways (crookedly) and instructs him to walk straight.
2.  **The Challenge:** The son asks his mother to show him how to do it correctly, promising to follow her lead.
3.  **The Conflict:** The mother is physically unable to walk straight herself because it is contrary to her nature.
4.  **The Lesson:** The mother cannot teach her son to do something she cannot do herself. This highlights that ""precepts"" (verbal instructions or rules) are useless if the person giving them does not set a proper ""example.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. It suggests that showing someone how to behave (example) is more effective and necessary than simply telling them what to do (precept).
*   **B:** While the mother isn't content, the story is specifically about instruction and hypocrisy, not general happiness.
*   **C:** This focuses on guidance, but the core irony is the mother's inability to follow her own rules.
*   **D:** While there is an accusation at the end, the story is primarily a lesson on leadership and teaching.
*   **E:** This is factually incorrect based on the story, as the mother *cannot* give clear guidance.

Conclusion: The fable illustrates that one should not criticize others for faults they themselves possess, and that teaching is best done through action rather than words.

morables_383,A wolf had assembled an immense store of booty in his den so that he could feast on all sorts of delicacies for months into the future. When the fox found out about this she paid a visit to the wolf a,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Wolf:** He is a thief who has hoarded ""booty"" (stolen goods). He is spiteful and suspicious, refusing to share or even be civil with the fox.
2.  **The Fox:** She is a deceiver who initially tries to trick the wolf for food. When rejected, she turns to betrayal, leading a shepherd to kill the wolf so she can steal the wolf's stolen goods.
3.  **The Outcome:** Both characters are portrayed as villainous or ""thieves"" in their own right. The wolf dies due to his spite and greed, and the fox eventually dies, admitting her ""serious crime"" and acknowledging that her death is a result of bringing about the death of another.

**Evaluation of the options:**
- **A) Take pleasure when thieves destroy themselves:** This aligns with the classical interpretation of this fable (often attributed to Aesop or Phaedrus). The story depicts two ""thieves"" (the hoarding wolf and the treacherous fox) who essentially cause each other's downfall. The reader is meant to see that when the wicked plot against one another, justice is served.
- **B) Never trust a known deceiver:** While relevant to the wolf's suspicion, it doesn't cover the fox's eventual demise.
- **C) Gratitude tempers relentless spite:** The story lacks gratitude entirely; it focuses on spite and betrayal.
- **D) Cunning wit has always a spiteful answer ready:** This describes the dialogue, but not the lesson learned from the final tragedy.
- **E) Isolation in abundance can lead to unexpected companionship:** The story ends in death and betrayal, not companionship.

The narrative arc focuses on the self-destructive nature of those who live by theft and treachery. When the wolf (a thief) and the fox (a betrayer/thief) are eliminated through their own vices, the ""moral"" is that the destruction of such characters is a just outcome.

morables_91,An Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it. But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; ,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Conflict:** An Eagle and a Serpent are locked in a life-and-death struggle.
2.  **The First Kind Act:** A countryman intervenes to help the Eagle, saving its life and allowing it to escape.
3.  **The Revenge:** The Serpent attempts to kill the man by poisoning his water.
4.  **The Second Kind Act (Reciprocity):** The Eagle, recognizing that the man saved him, intervenes to save the man's life by knocking the poisoned water away.

The core of the story is the exchange of life-saving favors between the countryman and the Eagle. The man helped the Eagle, and in return, the Eagle helped the man. This sequence perfectly illustrates the concept of reciprocity.

*   **A) One good turn deserves another:** This fits precisely. The Eagle returns the favor (the ""good turn"") that the man did for him.
*   **B) Do not try to grasp too much at once:** This is the moral of ""The Boy and the Filberts,"" not this story.
*   **C) Quick actions can be vengeful:** While the serpent is vengeful, this describes a plot point rather than the overarching lesson of the Eagle's intervention.
*   **D) Destroy the swift seed...:** This refers to the moral of ""The Swallow and the Other Birds.""
*   **E) Even the mighty must be wary...:** While true for the Eagle initially, the resolution of the story focuses on the Eagle's gratitude toward the man.

The most accurate moral for this specific fable (often attributed to Aesop) is that acts of kindness are rewarded or returned.

His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, My master gives a feast, a",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events:

1.  **The Situation:** A guest Dog (an intruder) is invited by a resident Dog to a feast hosted by a Rich Man.
2.  **The Action:** The guest Dog enters the kitchen without the master or the cook's permission (he enters by the ""back stairs,"" so to speak, rather than as an official guest).
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he has no legitimate right to be there and is seen as an intruder by the Cook, he is violently thrown out of the window.
4.  **The Reaction:** To save face after his ignominious exit, he lies to his peers about how he left.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The ""back stairs"" represents gaining access through unofficial, illegitimate, or sneaky means. The ""window"" represents the sudden and forceful rejection that follows when unauthorized presence is discovered.
*   **B:** There were no enemies making promises in this story; it was a friend’s invitation.
*   **C:** While the dog hoped for food, the story is a cautionary tale about the consequences of intrusion, not a celebration of hope.
*   **D:** There was no specific ""known danger"" the dog was avoiding, nor was the invitation ""deceitful"" (the friend dog genuinely intended to share the food).
*   **E:** The story shows that generosity does *not* necessarily extend beyond intended boundaries, as the Cook did not share the Rich Man's generosity with the uninvited dog.

The fable teaches that those who sneak into places where they are not officially invited or authorized should not be surprised when they are treated harshly and expelled.

He ordered that the bag of coins be brought to him as he was dying and then asked",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative and the options provided:

1.  **Analyze the Narrative:** 
    *   The man is described as ""miserly"" and his wealth is ""ill-gotten"" (acquired through dishonest or immoral means).
    *   The wealth he ""sweated"" over is destined for two ends: his heirs will waste it on vices (squandering the fruit of his labor), and the ""demons"" will torment his soul because of how he acquired or hoarded it.
    *   The dialogue emphasizes that the money brings no lasting pleasure or legacy to the owner; instead, it results in the destruction of his soul and the misuse of the funds by others.

2.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A) A life of greed and hoarding wealth leads to misery:** While partially true, the story focuses specifically on the *consequences* of how the money was gotten and what happens after death.
    *   **B) It is better by far to be governed by one chief, than by many:** This is irrelevant to the story.
    *   **C) Ill-gotten gains bring eternal torment:** This aligns directly with the text’s mention of ""ill-gotten"" money and the ""demons who are going to turn your soul over to eternal torments."" It captures the core warning of the fable regarding the source and attachment to such wealth.
    *   **D) Benefit of unfamiliar things...:** This is a moral for a different fable (likely ""The Camel"").
    *   **E) The fruits of toil may not always yield the intended legacy:** This is a secondary theme, but the mention of ""eternal torments"" specifically linked to the ""ill-gotten"" nature of the wealth makes C a more precise moral for a traditional fable of this type.

**Conclusion:** The story serves as a warning against acquiring wealth through immoral means and hoarding it, as the ultimate ""pleasure"" of that money is reserved for those who waste it and those who punish the soul. Option C most directly addresses the specific fate mentioned by the bag of coins.

The city mouse finished his business in the country and by means of insistent inv,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Setup:** The story contrasts two lifestyles: the country mouse's ""humble meal of acorns"" and the city mouse's ""various delicacies"" in a room ""overflowing with food.""
2.  **The Conflict:** While the city mouse has abundance, it comes with constant danger. When a human enters, the city mouse is safe only because he has a hiding spot, while the country mouse is ""frightened out of his wits"" because he is in an unfamiliar, life-threatening environment.
3.  **The Resolution:** The city mouse values the quality of the food (""delicious food... anywhere else in the world""), but the country mouse rejects the feast.
4.  **The Lesson:** The country mouse concludes that humble food (acorns) is preferable if it comes with ""freedom"" and security. He would rather be poor and safe than rich and terrified.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the country mouse’s concluding sentiment. He chooses ""self-sufficient poverty"" (acorns/freedom) over ""the worries of wealth"" (delicacies/fear of the butler).
*   **B)** This is a generic moral (often associated with ""The Fox and the Goat"") and doesn't capture the specific contrast between wealth/danger and poverty/safety.
*   **C)** While true that the city mouse was less afraid because he was familiar with the hole, the story's focus is on the *choice* of lifestyle, not the ease of adaptation.
*   **D)** This is a moral about ingratitude (from ""The Hangman and the Thief""), which is irrelevant here.
*   **E)** This describes the plot's inciting incident (the invitation) but does not address the thematic conclusion regarding safety versus luxury.

1.  **The Premise:** A beetle, who is comfortable in his ""dung heap,"" sees an eagle and becomes envious of its stature and lifestyle.
2.  **The Conflict:** The beetle expresses contempt for his own nature (""not quite bugs and not quite birds"") and arrogantly compares his buzzing to the eagle's cry and his sheen to the eagle's majesty. He decides he is too good for the dung and attempts to live as a bird.
3.  **The Climax:** The beetle attempts to fly with the eagle but is physically unsuited for the high altitude and strong winds. He falls far from home.
4.  **The Resolution:** Shaken and starving, he realizes his mistake and craves the very position he previously despised (the dung heap).

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The beetle was arrogant and ""put on airs"" (literally and figuratively). By trying to reach a status he didn't possess, he failed to become a ""bird"" and lost his secure position in the dung heap, ending up miserable and lost.
*   **B:** There is no revenge in this story.
*   **C:** The story warns against trying to be something you are not, rather than celebrating diversity.
*   **D:** This is a quote from *The Jew of Malta* and pertains to physical force, which is not applicable here.
*   **E:** While his beginnings were humble, the story emphasizes the disaster of his ""wonder"" rather than any positive spark.

The story belongs to the tradition of Aesopic fables (specifically a variation of ""The Beetle and the Eagle"" or similar stories about social climbing), which frequently warn against overstepping one's natural station through hubris.

I can't decide what to do: my love of money and my innat",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A man finds a ""lion of gold."" This is a literal treasure made of precious metal, but its form (a lion) triggers his primal fear.
2.  **The Conflict:** The man is torn between his **greed** (love of money) and his **cowardice** (fear of the lion's shape). Even though the object is inanimate gold, his personal character prevents him from simply grabbing the wealth.
3.  **The Resolution:** Because he is too afraid to approach the gold himself, he decides to watch from a distance while others do the work. The central irony is that he has found a fortune he cannot personally handle or enjoy due to his own psychological limitations.
4.  **The Lesson:** The man addresses the ""treasure that offers no satisfaction"" and a ""gift... that is so unwelcome."" This highlights that the value of the gold is neutralized by his inability to overcome his fear to possess it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Wealth is of little value if one is too afraid to use or enjoy it:** This directly addresses the man's lament that the gold offers no satisfaction because his character won't allow him to approach it.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** This is irrelevant to the internal conflict of the man.
*   **C) Greed blinds the cowardly:** If anything, his cowardice is blinding him to the fact that the lion is just gold/inanimate; it is the opposite.
*   **D) Better to serve...:** The man is the master, not the servant.
*   **E) Indecision is the thief of opportunity:** While he is indecisive, the core of the fable focuses on the contradiction between the desire for wealth and the character flaws that prevent its enjoyment.

The fable (attributed to Aesop) is traditionally used to illustrate that for a coward, even a stroke of luck or a great fortune is useless because they lack the courage to claim or utilize it.

When opinions were exchanged back and forth, the ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interaction between the hares and the lions:

1.  **The Context:** The animals hold an assembly to address grievances.
2.  **The Proposal:** The hares argue for universal equality in power and dignity so that the weak are no longer preyed upon by the strong.
3.  **The Conflict:** The hares' proposal is based on an ideal of fairness and abstract justice.
4.  **The Resolution:** The lions dismiss the argument not by challenging its logic, but by pointing out the physical reality: the hares lack the ""claws and teeth"" (the power) to enforce or sustain such a policy.
5.  **The Lesson:** This fable (attributed to Aesop) illustrates that laws or arguments for equality are often ineffective unless those proposing them have the power or means to back them up. In a world governed by strength, an argument without the means to defend it is disregarded by those who hold power.

*   **A) Be prepared to defend your position:** This aligns with the lions' point. The hares have a ""good"" idea, but without the physical or practical means to defend their stance, their words are empty in the eyes of the strong. 
*   **B, C, D, and E:** These options either represent ""idealist"" views that the story explicitly subverts (C, D, E) or relate to different fables (B).

The story serves as a cynical reminder that might often dictates reality over right, and one must have the strength to support their claims.

There was a whole crowd of monkeys there and one of them ,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character motivations:

1.  **The Setting:** The men are in a ""land of monkeys"" (an environment governed by an irrational or self-important leader). The leader monkey is imitating human royalty, which establishes that he values image and status over his actual nature.
2.  **The Liar's Outcome:** The liar recognizes the leader's vanity and feeds it with falsehoods (""You are the emperor""). He is rewarded because his lies align with the leader's ego.
3.  **The Truth-Teller's Reasoning:** The second man assumes that if a lie earns a reward, the truth must merit an even greater one. He fails to account for the fact that the leader prefers the illusion to reality.
4.  **The Conflict:** When told the objective truth (""You are simply a monkey""), the leader feels insulted rather than enlightened. The group (those who thrive on the deception) lashes out violently at the person who broke the illusion.

**Evaluating the choices:**
*   **B** and **D** are irrelevant to the specific outcomes of the men.

*   **E** is incorrect because truth was clearly *not* a defense in this scenario; it led to physical harm.
*   **A** captures the core irony of the fable: In an environment built on ego and deception, speaking the truth is seen as an attack, and those invested in the lie will retaliate against the truth-teller.

The story illustrates that while truth is a virtue, those who are obsessed with flattery and false status perceive the truth as a threat.

morables_495,"A man was in love with an ugly, wicked slave-woman from his own household and was quick to give her whatever she asked for. This slave-woman, bedecked with gold and trailing a delicate purple robe aro",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** A man is obsessed with an ""ugly, wicked"" slave-woman. He treats her with extreme generosity, providing her with luxuries reserved for free citizens or nobility (gold, purple robes).
2.  **The Conflict:** The slave-woman becomes arrogant and attacks the master's wife, believing her success is due to her own charms or the favor of Aphrodite (the goddess of beauty).
3.  **The Resolution:** Aphrodite intervenes to clarify that she has had no part in making the woman beautiful. In fact, she expresses contempt for the man’s twisted perception.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the irrationality of the man’s love. By having the goddess of beauty herself disavow the woman’s appeal, the fable suggests that the man's attraction is a form of madness or a ""curse"" from the gods, as it goes against natural beauty and order. 

Comparing this to the options:
- **A** captures the traditional Aesopic moral: the man is viewed as being ""out of his mind"" because he sees beauty where even the goddess of beauty sees ugliness.
- **B** is irrelevant as there is no mention of a conscience.
- **C** and **E** are modern sentiments that contradict the tone of the fable, which explicitly labels the woman as ""ugly"" and ""wicked"" even after being given gifts.
- **D** is incorrect as the slave-woman is not beautiful, nor is her lot ""rightful.""

In the context of classical Greek fables (specifically Babrius or Aesop), the moral often emphasizes that the gods find those who are deluded or who prefer the ""base"" over the ""noble"" to be offensive or insane.

Aesop therefore shared this little story with the father,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this story, let's analyze the lesson step by step:

1.  **The Context:** The story is a response to a father struggling with an ""unmanageable"" and ""vicious"" son who acts out violently when left alone. 
2.  **The Allegory:** The farmer (representing authority/the father) yokes an ""old bull"" (representing experience/moderation) to a ""young bull"" (representing the reckless son).
3.  **The Purpose:** The farmer explicitly states that the old bull is not there to do heavy labor, but to ""keep the young bull in check"" and prevent him from laming others with his ""kicking and butting.""
4.  **The Advice:** Aesop concludes that the father must keep the boy beside him so that the father's ""moderation"" can ""restrain"" the boy's ""reckless inclinations.""

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A:** While the story mentions moderation, the focus is more on the active restraint of aggression through wisdom/experience rather than just a ""disposition"" alone stopping behavior.
*   **B:** Irrelevant to the story's actual plot.
*   **C:** This captures the essence of the ""yoking"" strategy. The experienced (the wise/the old) must be paired with the aggressive (the young/reckless) to provide a tempering influence.
*   **D:** This is the moral of *The Tortoise and the Hare*, not this story.
*   **E:** While true that unchecked behavior leads to harm, the specific lesson offered by Aesop is the *method* of correction—using the steady presence of an elder to temper a youth.

**Conclusion:** The central lesson is that the steady, moderate influence of an elder or wise figure serves as a necessary restraint on the volatile aggression of the young.

All the other passengers started to swim, but the Athenian kept praying to Athena, maki",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A ship capsizes in a storm. Everyone is in the water, facing a life-threatening situation.
2.  **The Athenian's Action:** He relies entirely on divine intervention (praying to Athena) and making promises of future rewards instead of physically trying to save himself.
3.  **The Companion's Advice:** A fellow passenger points out the flaw in this logic, telling him that while he seeks help from the gods, he must also perform the physical action necessary for survival (""moving your arms"").
4.  **The Syllogism:** This fable is the origin of the famous proverb ""God helps those who help themselves"" (or ""Along with Athena, move your hands""). It emphasizes that faith or outside help is not a substitute for personal exertion.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) Self-effort is essential:** This directly aligns with the message that one must physically swim (effort) rather than just pray.
*   **B) A learned man has always a fund of riches in himself:** This is the moral of a different Aesop fable (The Shipwreck of Simonides).
*   **C) True power lies in practicality:** While related, ""Self-effort"" is the specific traditional moral associated with this fable.
*   **D) Powerful opposites...:** Irrelevant to the story.
*   **E) True character is revealed when the tides turn:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific lesson about effort vs. prayer.

The story teaches that humans must take action to save themselves rather than relying solely on external or divine aid.

1.  **The Conflict:** The Frog and the Mouse are so focused on their internal rivalry and their desire for ""sovereignty"" over the marsh that they commit to a ""fight to the death.""
2.  **The Distraction:** Their intense focus on one another prevents them from noticing their surroundings or potential external threats.
3.  **The Outcome:** Because they are preoccupied with their petty quarrel, a third party (the Kite) is able to swoop in and take advantage of the situation, destroying both combatants easily.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) When fools fight others run away with the prize:** While the Kite ""takes"" the combatants, the story emphasizes the destruction of the rivals rather than the Kite ""winning"" the marsh.
*   **B) People who do harm to others destroy themselves in the bargain:** While they are destroyed, the focus is more on the vulnerability caused by their conflict rather than the harm they intended for each other.
*   **C & D:** These focus on the perspective of a defender or the predator, which are secondary to the main theme of the rivals' folly.
*   **E) Rivalries can blind us to the greater dangers lurking nearby:** This most accurately captures the essence of the fable. The Frog and the Mouse were so obsessed with their battle for status that they became blind to the Kite, a much more significant threat to their lives.

In traditional collections of Aesop's fables, this story is most frequently used to illustrate how internal strife makes parties vulnerable to a common enemy or how preoccupation with small quarrels leads to total ruin from an outside source.

The surviving daughter wondered to see strangers so much concerned at the loss of her sister, and he",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context**: A family has suffered a loss. The mother has hired professional mourners to attend the funeral.
2.  **The Observation**: The surviving daughter notices a paradox: the strangers (the hired mourners) are outwardly expressing intense grief and concern, while the actual family members (the ""nearest relations"") appear relatively composed.
3.  **The Reason**: The mother explains that the family’s grief is internal and that ""crying"" doesn't change their situation (""never the better for it""). However, the strangers are crying because it is their job—they are being paid to perform that emotion.
4.  **The Lesson**: The fable highlights the difference between genuine emotion and performance for profit. It sheds light on the nature of ""professional"" displays of virtue or sorrow, which are motivated by commerce rather than sincerity.

Looking at the options:
*   **B, C, D, and E** do not accurately reflect the core of the story. Option D is far too complex and misattributes ""temptation"" to the daughter. Option E contradicts the story, as the ""shared sorrow"" is faked for money.
*   **A** directly addresses the mother's explanation: the ""mourners"" are professionals who provide a service to those who pay. While the fable also serves as a commentary on the artificiality of hired grief, Option A is the most accurate summary of the specific transactional nature described in the text.

1.  **The Encounter:** A traveler finds ""Truth"" personified as a woman living alone in the desert (the wilderness), away from civilization.
2.  **The Conflict:** When asked why she is there, Truth explains that she has been driven out of the city (human society).
3.  **The Reason:** Truth states that in the past, lies were rare (""found among only a few""), but now ""they have spread throughout all of human society.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the pervasive nature of dishonesty in the modern world. If Truth must live in the desert because there is no room for her in the city, it implies that society is now governed by falsehoods.

Evaluating the options:
- **A) Falsehood is with all men:** This directly reflects Truth's statement that lies have spread through ""all of human society.""
- **B, C, D, E:** These options introduce concepts (selfishness, curiosity, fear of the unknown, or compassion) that are not the central focus of Truth's lament about the ubiquity of lies.

As the ox stru",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Situation:** A donkey and an ox are tasked with pulling a shared load. The ox is injured but works hard; the donkey refuses to help.
2.  **The Consequence of Inaction:** Because the donkey doesn't help, the ox overexerts himself and dies.
3.  **The Shift in Burden:** Once the ox dies, the donkey is forced to carry not only the original load but also the weight of the dead ox. This proves to be too much, and the donkey dies as a result.
4.  **The Lesson:** The birds explicitly state that if the donkey had helped the ox, he would have lived.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses the idea that refusing to help a partner/neighbor results in their portion of the burden (and more) falling upon you. This matches the plot perfectly.
*   **B** is a general proverb, but not specific to the dynamics of this story.
*   **C** is incorrect because hard work did not triumph (the ox died) and the cruelty (the driver/donkey's laziness) led to a tragedy for everyone.
*   **D** is vauge; the burden wasn't ""unhelpful,"" it was shared.
*   **E** focuses on strength and perseverance, but the story's core message is about cooperation and the consequences of selfishness.

1.  **The Context of Creation:** The fable begins by stating that man was made in a hurry, which resulted in the omission of ""modesty"" from his original constitution.
2.  **The Solution:** Jupiter decides to introduce modesty into the human population generally rather than individually.
3.  **The Conflict/Condition:** Modesty initially resists but eventually agrees to be part of the human experience on one specific condition: she refuses to stay in the presence of ""carnal love.""
4.  **The Direct Quote:** Modesty explicitly states, ""for wherever that [carnal love] comes... I'm gone.""

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) Modesty and carnal love cannot survive together.** This directly reflects the conclusion of the story and the specific condition set by Modesty.
*   **B) We must not require what is unreasonable.** While Jupiter’s request could be seen as unusual, the focus of the fable is on the relationship between Modesty and Love.
*   **C) Haste can lead to unwelcome outcomes.** While the story mentions haste at the beginning, the primary ""lesson"" or mechanical takeaway of the fable explains a certain human behavior/dynamic (the absence of modesty in certain situations) rather than warning against speed.
*   **D) Do not unmodestly mock... old age.** This is irrelevant to the text provided.
*   **E) Virtues shared are virtues gained.** This contradicts the narrative of Modesty being reluctant and conditional.

The story serves as an aetiological myth explaining why modesty disappears when carnal desire is present. Therefore, the moral or central observation is the incompatibility of the two.

1.  **The Premise:** A fox and a monkey are traveling together. The monkey makes a grandiose claim about his lineage, asserting that the dead people in a cemetery were once his family's subjects (freedmen).
2.  **The Conflict:** The monkey is bragging about something that cannot be verified. He chooses a location (a cemetery) where his audience (the fox) cannot check the facts with those involved (the dead).
3.  **The Climax/Reaction:** The fox points out the convenience of the monkey's choice. By speaking for the dead, the monkey ensures he won't be contradicted, because ""not a single one... can rise up and refute what you say.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The fox is exposing the monkey’s opportunism. The story demonstrates that people who want to tell lies often choose subjects or witnesses who are unable to speak for themselves or challenge the validity of the claims.

Let's evaluate the options:
*   **A)** Directly addresses the fox's point: Deceivers exploit the fact that their claims cannot be challenged by those they are talking about.
*   **B)** Is irrelevant to the story.
*   **C)** Is a general truth about deception but lacks the specific context of exploiting the inability of others to refute claims.
*   **D)** Deals with the consequences of being caught; however, the monkey isn't necessarily ""in deep water"" yet, he is just being criticized for the timing of his lie.
*   **E)** Is too vague.

The most accurate moral, based on the specific dialogue of the fox, is that liars often choose to brag when their falsehoods cannot be proven wrong.

1.  **The Act of Kindness:** The Farmer shows compassion to a creature in distress (the frozen Snake) and goes to great lengths to help it (placing it in his bosom).
2.  **The Result:** Despite the Farmer saving its life, the Snake follows its ""natural instincts"" and bites him.
3.  **The Realization:** The Farmer realizes that his kindness was misplaced because the nature of the recipient (the ""scoundrel"") does not change regardless of the help received.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful:** This fits perfectly. The Snake received the ultimate kindness (life-saving) but remained lethal and ungrateful due to its nature.
*   **B) The man who treats others well is rewarded by gratitude:** The story explicitly contradicts this; the Farmer is rewarded with death.
*   **C) Gratitude prevents regret:** This does not fit the narrative arc.
*   **D) Injuries may be regretfully forgiven, but not ungratefully forgotten:** This focuses on the victim's forgiveness, whereas the story focuses on the danger of helping those who are intrinsically malicious.
*   **E) Even in the coldest times, a touch of compassion can revive what seems lost:** While true in a literal sense (the Snake revived), the story serves as a warning *against* doing this for ""scoundrels,"" making this an incomplete or misleading moral.

The lesson is that kindness does not change an evil or ungrateful nature, and one should be careful about whom they help.

1.  **The Context:** The dog lives with blacksmiths who perform loud, strenuous work. The dog is able to sleep through the ""heaviest hammers clanging,"" showing that he ignores things that do not involve his own immediate benefit or comfort.
2.  **The Shift:** As soon as the sound of eating begins (the ""slightest sound of teeth chewing""), the dog wakes up and approaches them. This indicates that the dog is highly attentive to physical rewards (food) but indifferent to the labor of his masters.
3.  **The Masters' Observation:** The blacksmiths point out the hypocrisy/selective attention of the dog: he is ""deaf"" to the work but has ""perfect hearing"" for the meal.

**Evaluation of the options:**
*   **A:** This matches the story perfectly. The dog is ""unaware"" (or chooses to ignore) the work that doesn't concern him but ""quickly notices"" the meal that benefits him.
*   **B:** This relates to agency/delegation, which is not present here.
*   **C:** While the blacksmiths are diligent and the dog is opportunistic, the fable focuses more on the dog's *selective perception* rather than a triumph of diligence over opportunism.
*   **D:** There is no ""tyrant"" in this story, and the dog isn't making an excuse; he is simply acting on instinctual self-interest.
*   **E:** This is a literal interpretation of the noise, missing the social commentary on self-interest.

1.  **The Setup:** The lion and the unicorn are established as ""chief enemies.""
2.  **The Deception:** The lion feigns sickness and old age (vulnerability) to lower the unicorn's guard. He explicitly asks the unicorn to surrender his primary means of defense (his horn).
3.  **The Mistake:** The unicorn, moved by pity and the lion's word, forgets the nature of their rivalry and relinquishes his defense, leaving himself ""defenceless.""
4.  **The Consequence:** The lion immediately betrays the unicorn once he is vulnerable. 
5.  **The Dialogue:** The lion justifies his treachery by stating that showing mercy to an enemy is a weakness. The unicorn responds by condemning the lion's lack of honor.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **B and D** are irrelevant or nonsensical in this context.
*   **C** is a general truth, but not as specific to the narrative of an *enemy* using a plea for help to disarm you.
*   **E** represents the unicorn's perspective/closing argument, but the fable's primary action serves as a warning about the physical danger of trusting a predator.
*   **A** captures the core lesson: The unicorn’s downfall was not just trusting a stranger, but trusting a known ""chief enemy"" who appeared humble and supplicating. By giving up his ""sturdy"" horn, he invited his own destruction. 

The story serves as a cautionary tale: a person's nature does not change just because they appear weak or make a promise. If you are enemies, disarming yourself based on their word is a fatal error.

1.  **The Starting Point:** The Pike is already a ""Prince"" in his own domain (the river). He possesses size, beauty, and strength.
2.  **The Conflict:** He becomes overambitious and dissatisfied with his current status. He seeks to conquer a domain that is not his (the sea).
3.  **The Climax:** He encounters a force far greater than himself (the Dolphin) in that new domain and is nearly killed.
4.  **The Resolution:** He returns to his river and learns to stay within his own territory.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A) Be content with your lot:** This fits the story perfectly. The Pike had everything he needed in the river but risked it all because he wasn't content. His ""lesson learned"" was to stay where he belonged.
- **B) Value is what others think of you:** The story focuses on the Pike's ego and his defeat, not his reputation.
- **C) Strength without humility invites downfall:** While the Pike lacked humility, the core theme is specifically about boundaries and contentment with one's own station.
- **D) Ambitious counsel without mighty help is useless:** This is a classic Aesop moral (often associated with ""The Belly and the Members"" or similar), but no ""counsel"" was given here; it was the Pike's own choice.
- **E) True leadership is not just about appearance:** While appearance is mentioned, the story isn't about how he ruled, but about his attempt to expand his territory.

The most accurate moral is that one should be satisfied with their own domain and status rather than risking everything to gain more than they can handle. This is the definition of being content with one's lot.

3.  **The Response:** The soldier who actually fought points out the hypocrisy. He notes that the coward’s words mean nothing because his actions (turning tail and running) proved he is unreliable.

1.  **The Premise**: All birds are invited to a wedding, but one bird, the Hoopoe, is given a special seat of honor.
2.  **The Reasoning for Honor**: The Hoopoe is honored because of its ""crown"" and ""multicolored feathers""—purely aesthetic, outward characteristics.
3.  **The Contrast (The Reality)**: The narrator points out that despite its beautiful appearance, the Hoopoe spends its time in ""dung and filth.""
4.  **The Conflict**: The other birds resent this because the high honor is based on a superficial appearance that does not match the bird's actual nature or habits.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) True worth should be measured by character and deeds, not by outward appearances.** This fits perfectly. The Hoopoe looks like royalty but acts in a way that is filthy/ignoble. The story criticizes the decision to honor outward beauty over inherent behavior.
*   **B) It is very unwise... to provoke the least...** This is the moral for ""The Eagle and the Beetle,"" but it doesn't apply here as there is no revenge plot.
*   **C) Resentment tarnishes celebration.** While resentment is mentioned, the fable's focus is on *why* the resentment is justified (the misplaced honor), not the emotional state of the wedding guests.
*   **D) Notable kindness is never wasted.** No specific act of kindness is performed in this story.
*   **E) Inclusivity...** The story focuses on hierarchy and superficiality, not the benefits of including everyone.

The story highlights the folly of judging a creature (or person) by their ""fine feathers"" while ignoring their true nature and habits.

A swallow saw what the hen was doing and said, 'O you stupid, senseless creature! They w",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Character's Action:** The hen finds snake eggs and treats them as her own, providing warmth and protection (brooding) so that they may hatch.
2.  **The Nature of the Subject:** Snakes are natural predators and inherently ""wicked"" or dangerous in the context of Aesop's fables.
3.  **The Warning:** A swallow observes this and calls the hen ""senseless."" The swallow warns that by helping the snakes hatch, the hen is nurturing her own killers. Once they are born, their nature will drive them to destroy the one who cared for them and others.
4.  **The Lesson:** Kindness or devotion shown to the ""wicked"" or naturally dangerous does not change their nature; it only empowers them to do harm.

Looking at the options:
*   **A)** Correct. It highlights the danger of trusting or nurturing something ""wicked"" (like a snake) simply because it appears harmless (as an egg).
*   **B)** This is the moral of ""The Dog and the Shadow"" or ""The Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs.""
*   **C)** The story suggests the opposite; the hen's devotion creates danger.
*   **D)** This is the moral of ""The Frog and the Ox.""
*   **E)** While the hen's compassion transcends boundaries, the story serves as a cautionary tale against such actions rather than a celebration of them.

The fable (often titled ""The Hen and the Swallow"") is a classic illustration that providing favors to enemies or the wicked is a self-destructive act.

The jackdaw, however, could not stand to live in human society, so w",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character's realization:

1.  **The Situation:** The jackdaw is captured and kept as a pet (a ""slave in human society""). While it is safe and fed, it lacks freedom.
2.  **The Action:** The bird seeks freedom at any cost. It escapes when given a brief opportunity.
3.  **The Outcome:** Due to the string still attached to its leg (a remnant of its time with humans), the bird becomes trapped in its own home and faces death.
4.  **The Realization:** The bird blames its own state of mind or its decision-making, acknowledging that its refusal to endure one condition led to a far worse one (death).

Looking at the options:
*   **A)** focuses on how our internal perspective and reactions to our conditions dictate our outcome. The jackdaw’s inability to reconcile with its situation led to its demise.
*   **B), C), and D)** deal with pity, generosity, and betrayal, none of which are the primary focus of the bird's final monologue.
*   **E)** is a theme in the story (the bird did not appreciate the ""gift"" of a home because it lacked freedom), but the bird's actual realization is about the consequence of its own restless nature and choices.

In traditional Aesopic fables, this specific story (The Jackdaw and the String) is often used to illustrate that in seeking to escape one minor misfortune or ""servitude,"" we may inadvertently rush into total destruction. It highlights that our contentment (or lack thereof) and our choices govern our fate. Option A best captures the philosophical weight of the bird's final realization.

morables_639,"Once, a terrible storm blew at sea, and one sailor noticed that the rest of his companions were each praying to different saints. 'Be careful, my friends,' he said, 'what if we all drown before the me",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** The sailors are in a life-threatening storm and are wasting time praying to various intermediaries (saints) to relay their messages to a higher power.
2.  **The Sailor’s Logic:** He points out that using intermediaries is inefficient and risky in an emergency. If the ""messenger"" (the saint) doesn't reach the destination in time, they will perish.
3.  **The Resolution:** By bypassing the middlemen and going ""directly to the one who can save us,"" they save time and achieve their goal (the calming of the wind).
4.  **The Lesson:** The story argues against unnecessary bureaucracy or indirect methods when a direct route is available. Efficiency and directness lead to the best results, especially in times of crisis.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) The shortest and surest way of doing things is best:** This aligns perfectly with the sailor’s advice to skip the intermediaries and take the most direct path.
*   **B) It is better to be loved than feared:** This is a Machiavellian theme not present here.
*   **C) Mercy tempers power:** While the storm subsides, the focus is on the *method* of the prayer, not the nature of the deity.
*   **D) Not all pragmatic advice is diverse or wise:** The advice given *was* wise, so this contradicts the story.
*   **E) Urgency in communication is vital:** While communication was urgent, the core lesson is about the *directness* and *efficiency* of the path taken.

This fable is traditionally attributed to Aesop (or similar folklore collections), often summarized with the moral that direct action is superior to indirect action.

The mice who lived in the house were always being hunted down by either the snake or the weasel, so when they saw the snake and the ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the actions and consequences:

1.  **The Context:** The snake and the weasel are natural predators (powerful parties) in a state of conflict. The mice are their natural prey (vulnerable bystanders).
2.  **The Action:** The mice assume that because their enemies are distracted by one another, it is safe to emerge. They misinterpret the conflict as a permanent diversion.
3.  **The Consequence:** The moment the predators notice the mice, they set aside their mutual grievance to exploit the easier, shared target. The ""bystanders"" (mice) suffer because they let their guard down during a conflict between more powerful entities.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** highlights that bystanders (the mice) suffer when caught in or reacting to the conflicts of powerful parties.
*   **B, C, and E** do not accurately reflect the specific turn of events where the enemies unite against a third party.
*   **D** is a more complex philosophical statement, but the core of this specific Aesop’s fable (often titled ""The Snake, the Weasel, and the Mice"") focuses on the danger of weaker parties inserting themselves or becoming exposed during the quarrels of the powerful.

The most standard moral associated with this fable is that when those who are powerful fight, the weak should not rejoice or let their guard down, for the combatants may easily turn on them. Option A best captures this dynamic.

morables_658,"A Goldfinch escaped from his Master's Cage, and the Master tried to get him back, but the bird refused to return. 'Well!' said the Boy, 'you'll regret it, because you'll never be as well cared for any",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the core conflict and the resolution:

1.  **The Conflict:** A goldfinch has escaped a cage where it was well-fed and ""cared for"" by a master. The master (the boy) attempts to lure it back by arguing that the bird will never find such security or physical comfort elsewhere.
2.  **The Resolution:** The bird acknowledges the risk and the loss of comfort (""That may be true"") but explicitly chooses autonomy over security (""I would rather take care of myself than be under your care"").
3.  **The Lesson:** The value of being free and independent (liberty) outweighs the value of material comfort or security provided by a master.

**Evaluating the options:**
- **A) There is no wealth greater than liberty.** This fits perfectly. The bird views its freedom as more valuable than the ""wealth"" of care provided in the cage.
- **B)** This refers to interpersonal treatment and is irrelevant to the bird/cage dynamic.
- **C)** This misinterprets the boy's motivation or the bird's reaction.
- **D)** This is a play on Horace's ""Caelum, non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt"" (They change their sky, not their soul, who run across the sea), which does not fit the theme of freedom vs. security.
- **E) Freedom is a treasure worth pursuing, even at great risk.** While very close and thematically similar, ""wealth"" in option A serves as a direct antonym to the ""cared for"" (material provision) argument made by the boy. In classical fables of this type (such as Aesop's ""The Wolf and the Dog""), the moral traditionally emphasizes that liberty is the greatest of all goods, often using the word ""wealth"" or ""riches"" to contrast with the master's food.

Option A is the most classic and precise distillation of this specific fable's message.

morables_638,"A donkey was complaining that he lacked horns, while a monkey was complaining that she lacked a tail. The mole said to them, 'Silence your complaining, since you can see that I am deprived of eyes.'",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions between the characters step by step:

1.  **The Donkey and the Monkey:** Both animals are focused on minor physical traits they lack (horns and a tail). These can be seen as ""misfortunes"" or perceived deficiencies that make them unhappy.
2.  **The Mole's Intervention:** The mole interrupts them to point out a much more significant deficiency: he is completely blind (""deprived of eyes""). 
3.  **The Lesson:** The mole's situation puts the complaints of the donkey and the monkey into perspective. By comparing their minor complaints (cosmetic or non-essential traits) to the mole's major disability (loss of a primary sense), the story suggests that one's own problems often seem less severe when compared to the greater hardships others face.

Looking at the options:
*   **A)** matches this reasoning perfectly. It suggests that perspective and comparison to others' greater misfortunes lead to patience and less complaining.
*   **B)** is about cooperation and shared burdens (the moral of ""The Donkey and the Lapdog"" or ""The Horse and the Loaded Donkey"").
*   **C)** is a general truth but doesn't capture the specific element of comparison present in the mole's statement.
*   **D)** describes karma or retribution, which is not present here.
*   **E)** focuses on ""unique gifts,"" whereas the mole focuses on having even less than the others.

Therefore, the moral is that we often find our own burdens easier to bear when we realize that others have it much worse.

The soup fell out of the long bill of the Cra",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The Fox invites the Crane to dinner but serves the food in a flat dish. This is a ""trick"" designed to suit the Fox's anatomy while making it impossible for the Crane (with its long beak) to eat. The Fox finds amusement in the Crane's struggle.
2.  **The Crane's Reaction:** Instead of simply being angry, the Crane retaliates using the exact same logic. He invites the Fox to dinner and serves the food in a long-necked flagon. This suits the Crane's anatomy perfectly but makes it impossible for the Fox to eat.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Fox experiences the same frustration she forced upon the Crane. The text describes this as a ""fitting requital"" (repayment in kind).

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) ""Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.""** This is the ""Golden Rule."" The story illustrates the negative inversion of this: if you treat others poorly or trick them, you should expect to be treated the same way in return.
*   **B) ""Beware the sort of person who uses tricks.""** While the Fox is tricky, the story focuses more on the *consequence* of the trick rather than a warning to avoid such people.
*   **C, D, and E:** These options misinterpret the central theme of reciprocity and justice (requital) that the fable emphasizes.

The story teaches that the way you treat others will eventually be the way others treat you. Because the Fox was unkind and inconsiderate, the Crane paid her back in kind. This aligns most closely with the lesson of the Golden Rule.

Wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the persons in her father's house, he made some excuse to send her home o",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation**: A man’s wife is disliked by everyone in his household. To test if the problem is her behavior or the environment, he sends her to her father’s house.
2.  **The Observation**: Upon her return, she complains that the herdsmen and shepherds (who work outside all day and only see her briefly at dawn and dusk) looked at her with ""aversion.""
3.  **The Conclusion**: The husband concludes that if the people who barely saw her disliked her, those who had to spend the entire day with her must have found her unbearable.
4.  **The Lesson**: Small signs or interactions (the reaction of the shepherds) are indicators of a larger, systemic reality (her overall personality and how she is perceived by everyone). 

Looking at the options:
- **A) Straws show how the wind blows**: This is a classic idiom meaning that small signs or minor incidents indicate the direction of a larger trend or a more general situation. This fits the husband's logic perfectly—the small interaction with the shepherds revealed the greater truth of her character.
- **B) Not all things are suitable for all people**: This doesn't fit, as the issue is her character, not ""suitability.""
- **C) Curiosity can avert disapproval**: Incorrect; the husband's curiosity confirmed the disapproval.
- **D) Curious and observant true friends are hard to find**: Not relevant to the plot.
- **E) Harmony at home begins with mutual respect**: While perhaps a general truth, it doesn't capture the specific logical point of the fable (deducing a large truth from a small sign).

1.  **The Action:** A wheel is creaking (making noise/complaining).
2.  **The Observation:** The coachman notices it is the ""worst wheel of the whole set.""
3.  **The Subtext:** The wheels that are doing the most work or are in the best condition remain silent, while the one that is failing or provides the least value is the one making the most noise.

In classical fables (specifically this one by Aesop, often titled ""The Creaking Wheels""), the lesson centers on the idea that those who are the least capable, the most troublesome, or the weakest are often the ones who complain the loudest or demand the most attention.

**Step-by-step evaluation of options:**
*   **A) Complaining is the privilege of the weak:** This aligns with the idea that the ""worst"" wheel is the one ""taking the liberty"" to creak/complain.
*   **B) It's wise and kind to be considerate...:** This does not fit the coachman's reaction or the wheel's behavior.
*   **C) Curiosity leads to wisdom:** Not applicable.
*   **D) Be observant and wise to know your enemies:** Not applicable.
*   **E) Noise often masks vulnerability:** While close, ""privilege of the weak"" is the traditional interpretation of this specific fable (often phrased as ""Those who do the least work complain the most"").

In the context of the provided text, the coachman's surprise that the *worst* wheel is the one complaining points directly to the irony that those who contribute the least or are in the worst state often make the most noise.

The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, 'I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you'd gone right",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Event:** A woman of Sybaris breaks a jar.
2.  **The Response of the Jar/Injured Party:** Instead of addressing the immediate physical damage (the crack or break), the ""jar"" seeks legal recourse by finding a witness to build a court case.
3.  **The Woman's Rebuttal:** The woman points out the absurdity of the legal response. She suggests that the wise course of action would have been to get a ""bandage"" (to fix the leak or the break) rather than spending time and energy on litigation.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable highlights a contrast between **litigation/argumentation** and **practical problem-solving**. It mocks those who are more interested in assigning blame or winning a legal victory than actually repairing the damage or solving the underlying problem.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Action is more valuable than arguments.** This fits perfectly. The ""bandage"" represents the practical action needed to fix the problem, while the ""court-case"" represents the needless argument.
*   **B) You can't please everybody.** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **C) Practicality triumphs over sarcasm.** While the woman is being sarcastic, her point is that the jar *failed* to be practical. The story isn't about her sarcasm winning; it's about the foolishness of the jar's priorities.
*   **D) Practical fortune can occasionally...** This is a convoluted statement that doesn't align with the simple instructional nature of Aesopic fables.
*   **E) Small actions can reveal hidden strengths.** There are no ""hidden strengths"" revealed here; it's a commentary on foolish behavior.

The core lesson is that when something goes wrong, it is wiser to fix it than to argue about it.

When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict**: Two powerful, majestic groups (Dolphins and Whales) are engaged in a serious and destructive war.
2.  **The Intervention**: A Sprat (a very small, insignificant fish) offers to mediate the peace and act as a judge.
3.  **The Reaction**: The Dolphin rejects the offer immediately, stating that they would prefer to be destroyed by their powerful peers than allow someone as lowly as a Sprat to interfere in their business.
4.  **The Lesson**: The core of the story is about **pride** and **status**. The Dolphins and Whales are so proud of their stature that they view the assistance of an ""inferior"" as a greater insult than the war itself. They would rather face ruin than lose dignity by accepting help from someone they deem insignificant.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   (A) ""Some would rather fight than not"" focuses on aggression, but the story is specifically about the *refusal of help* based on status.
*   (B) This story isn't about adaptation.
*   (C) This is a strong contender, as pride is the driving force behind the refusal of peace.
*   (D) ""Every fierce, proud man for himself"" is a variation of the common moral associated with this Aesop's fable (often worded as: ""Some men of no consequence... think themselves of importance when they are caught in great life events""). It highlights that the pride of the powerful keeps the insignificant in their place. 
*   (E) While mutual ruin is a possibility, the story focuses more on the rejection of the ""inferior"" mediator.

In many classical collections of Aesop's Fables, the moral associated with ""The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat"" is that insignificant people are often held in contempt by the powerful, and the powerful would rather perish than be ""saved"" by those they look down upon. However, looking at the provided options, the most accurate distillation of the Dolphin's attitude—preferring destruction over the blow to their ego—is rooted in pride.

Between the options provided, the story most specifically illustrates that the ""ferociously proud"" would rather face their own end than allow an ""unimportant"" person to intervene.

When th",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Satyr observes the Man performing the same physical action (blowing breath) for two opposite purposes: first to warm his hands (hot) and then to cool his food (cold).
2.  **The Satyr's Interpretation:** The Satyr views this inconsistency with suspicion. To the Satyr, a person who can produce two contrary effects from the same source is inconsistent, duplicitous, or untrustworthy.
3.  **The Symbolism:** In fables, ""blowing hot and cold"" is a classic idiom used to describe a person who shifts their opinions, allegiances, or arguments depending on what is convenient at the moment. 
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A:** Directly addresses the idea of inconsistency and duplicity. If someone ""talks for both sides"" (or blows both hot and cold), they lack a stable character and cannot be trusted.
    *   **B, C, D, E:** These either address different themes (greed, evolution of character, or general discovery of truth) that do not specifically capture the Satyr's rejection of the Man based on his contradictory behavior.

1.  **The Setting:** Socrates builds a ""very modest"" or ""tiny"" house.
2.  **The Conflict:** A neighbor questions why a man of Socrates' stature would have such a small dwelling.
3.  **The Climax/Punchline:** Socrates responds, ""If only I could fill it with true friends!""

**Analysis:**
Socrates' response implies that even though the house is physically small, it is still ""too large"" for the number of ""true friends"" he currently has. He is highlighting the extreme rarity of genuine friendship. While the narrator's preamble mentions fame and posthumous vindication (which relates to option E), the actual fable (the interaction between Socrates and the neighbor) focuses solely on the scarcity of real friends. The house remains empty not because it is small, but because true friends are difficult to come by.

*   **A) True friends are hard to find:** This aligns perfectly with the punchline of the story.
*   **B) Guilty conscience:** Irrelevant to the text.
*   **C) Curiosity fuels wisdom:** Irrelevant to the text.
*   **D) Modest wise man:** This is a criticism of the narrator, not the moral of Socrates' fable.
*   **E) True greatness/hardships:** While the narrator reflects on this, the moral of the Socrates anecdote itself is about friendship.

2.  **The Internal Conflict:** The lion is so ashamed of this perceived flaw that he considers himself a coward and wishes for death.
3.  **The Encounter:** The lion meets the elephant, an animal even larger and more physically imposing than himself.
4.  **The Realization:** He discovers that the massive elephant is terrified of a tiny gnat entering his ear.
5.  **The Conclusion:** The lion realizes that if even the great elephant has a ""minor"" fear, his own fear of roosters is comparatively less embarrassing. He decides he is ""in much better shape"" than he thought and stops his self-pity.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) There is always someone else worse off than you:** This matches the lion's shift in perspective. By seeing the elephant’s struggle with an even smaller creature (the gnat), the lion realizes his situation is not as bad as he imagined.
*   **B) No matter how you brag, you can be undone:** The lion wasn't bragging; he was lamenting his own weakness.
*   **C) Strength alone does not guarantee invulnerability:** While true in the story, the *moral* focus is on the lion's change in attitude regarding his own misery through comparison with others.
*   **D) You may share the labours...:** This pertains to a different fable (the Lion's Share).
*   **E) Even divine gifts can spark envy:** The lion wasn't envied; he was the one dissatisfied with his gifts.

The primary lesson is that perspective is gained by seeing that others have problems too, often worse or more absurd than one's own.

morables_169,"The crow was making a sacrifice to Athena and invited a dog to the feast. The dog said to her, 'Why do you foolishly squander these sacrifices? The goddess clearly hates you so much that she has taken",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the crow and the dog:

1.  **The Context:** The crow is performing a sacrifice to Athena. In Greek mythology, the crow was once a favorite of Athena but was famously cast out or punished (losing its credibility as an omen) because of its meddling or bad news.
2.  **The Dog’s Perspective:** The dog points out the futility of the action. Since Athena already ""hates"" the crow and has stripped it of its status, sacrificing to her seems like a waste of resources.
3.  **The Crow’s Reasoning:** The crow admits that the relationship is bad but argues that this is specifically *why* she must sacrifice. She is using the sacrifice as a tactical bribe or a peace offering to ""change her [Athena's] attitude"" and regain favor.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates a pragmatic, if cynical, behavior: when someone (especially a powerful figure) is your enemy or dislikes you, you might go out of your way to treat them well or offer them gifts specifically to appease them and turn them into an ally.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The crow treats her ""enemy"" (Athena) well (sacrifice/feast) specifically to gain a benefit (restored credibility).
*   **B:** Irrelevant to the text.
*   **C:** Too vague; the crow's action is more calculated than purely optimistic.
*   **D:** The crow is acting *without* the means (credibility), contradicted by the story's outcome.
*   **E:** The story is about a goddess and a crow, not the friendship with the dog.

This fable (Aesop's ""The Crow and the Dog"") is traditionally interpreted as people being most eager to please those they fear or those who dislike them.

morables_418,"They say that the hyena has a double nature: for a period of time the hyena is male, and then later on she is female. The story goes that when a male hyena was treating a female badly, she said to him",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"In the fable of the hyena, the core narrative focuses on a reversal of roles and status. The female hyena warns the male who is mistreating her that their positions will soon be swapped, and he will eventually find himself in the subservient or vulnerable position he is currently forcing upon her.

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1.  **The Premise:** The fable relies on the (mythological/folkloric) idea that the hyena changes gender periodically. This represents a complete reversal of roles.
2.  **The Conflict:** A male hyena is ""treating a female badly,"" exercising power and cruelty over his counterpart.
3.  **The Warning:** The female points out that this power dynamic is temporary. She reminds him of the past (when he was in her position) and warns him about the future (when he will be in her position again).
4.  **The Lesson:** The story serves as a warning to those in power or in a superior position: do not mistreat those below you, because fortunes turn, roles reverse, and the person you are mistreating today may be the one in power over you tomorrow.

Comparing this to the options:
- **A** captures the essence of ""role reversal"" and the idea that those currently being ""judged"" (or mistreated/subordinated) will eventually hold the power to ""judge"" (or rule over) their former superiors. In many classical translations of Aesop, this specific fable is associated with the moral that those in office or power should not maltreat their subordinates, as they will soon be subordinates themselves.
- **B, C, and E** deal with flattery, adversity, or potential, which are not the focus of the warning.
- **D** focuses on mistrust, but the hyena's warning is about the consequences of behavior during a role reversal, not the ""mistrust"" caused by ambiguity.

The moral is about the cyclical nature of power and the need for fair treatment of others regardless of one's current status.

The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Proposal:** The lion seeks an alliance based on shared status (kings of their respective domains). He believes that because they are both ""rulers,"" they are naturally suited to help one another.
2.  **The Conflict:** The lion enters a battle on land (against a bull) and calls upon his ally for assistance.
3.  **The Failure:** The dolphin has the *will* to help, but lacks the physical *capability* because his nature restricts him to the water.
4.  **The Lesson:** The lion feels betrayed, but the dolphin points out that he is limited by his nature. The mistake was not the dolphin's lack of loyalty, but the lion's failure to consider whether his ally could actually provide support in the environment where he needed it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This directly addresses the lesson: when forming an alliance, one must ensure the ally is capable of providing aid during specific times of need (peril).
*   **B)** There was no ""inclination to betray"" in this story; the dolphin wanted to help but couldn't.
*   **C)** This is a minor observation, not a moral lesson.
*   **D)** This is a generic motivational statement unrelated to the specific outcome of the story.
*   **E)** While partially true, it doesn't capture the specific practical warning found in Aesop's fables regarding the choice of allies.

In the classic collections of Aesop's Fables, this story (The Lion and the Dolphin) is consistently paired with the moral that we should choose allies who are actually able to assist us in our times of trouble.

The fox then ask",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the key elements:

1.  **The Situation:** A fox tries to trick a cicada into coming down from a tree to eat it.
2.  **The Turning Point:** The cicada is not fooled. Instead of falling for the trap, it tests the fox with a leaf to confirm its suspicions.
3.  **The Lesson:** The cicada explains *why* it was so cautious: it saw the wings of another cicada in a fox's droppings (spoor). This means the cicada learned from the misfortune/death of its fellow cicadas.

Now let’s evaluate the options:
*   **A) A discerning person is made wise by the misfortunes of his neighbours.** This directly reflects the cicada's statement. It observed what happened to others of its kind and used that knowledge to protect itself.
*   **B) God is the ultimate judge.** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **C) Clever trickery breeds deception.** While trickery is present, the focus is on the cicada's wisdom in avoiding it, not the cycle of deception itself.
*   **D) Cautious fear... bring about the very fate we seek to avoid.** This is the opposite of what happened; the cicada's caution saved it.
*   **E) Cunning plans often reveal true intentions.** While the fox's plan was revealed, the primary lesson centers on the cicada's ability to avoid the trap through observation of others' fates.

Option A is the classic Aesopic moral for this specific fable (The Fox and the Cicada). It highlights that wise individuals learn from the mistakes or tragedies that befall others.

The Wolf, who lay lurking just by, heard this",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the plot:

1.  **The Command:** The mother Goat warns her Kid to stay inside and not open the door to anyone to ensure his safety.
2.  **The Deception:** The Wolf attempts to deceive the Kid by ""counterfeiting"" (mimicking) the voice of the mother Goat. This makes the Wolf a **hypocrite**—someone who pretends to be something they are not to hide their true, malicious intentions.
3.  **The Discovery:** The Kid is vigilant. He looks out the window, compares what he hears (a goat's voice) with what he sees (a wolf's appearance), and recognizes the ""cheat."" 
4.  **The Lesson:** Despite the Wolf's best efforts to act like a Goat, his true nature remained visible to the observant Kid.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) A hypocrite can usually be found out:** This directly matches the story. The Wolf acts as a hypocrite (mimicking the Goat), but the Kid sees through the disguise. 
*   **B) Concerns about demise:** This does not apply, as the Kid was not dying, and the Wolf wasn't pretending to be concerned; he was pretending to be the mother.
*   **C) Caring hearts:** While the Kid was smart, the focus is on the failure of the Wolf's deception, not the ""caring"" nature of the Kid's heart.
*   **D) Cautious arguments/cowards:** This does not fit the context of the fable.
*   **E) Neglecting careful oversight:** The Goat actually provided excellent oversight/instructions, and the Kid followed them, avoiding peril.

Apollo immediately explained to the snake, 'If you had simply killed the first person who ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation:** A snake is constantly being stepped on by people, implying it is treated with a lack of respect or perceived as harmless to the point of being a nuisance.
2.  **The Conflict:** The snake seeks divine counsel (Apollo) regarding its suffering.
3.  **The Solution/Advice:** Apollo points out that the snake's current predicament is a result of failing to set a precedent. If the snake had retaliated against the *first* person who stepped on it, the reputation of the snake's bite would have deterred all subsequent people from doing the same. 
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable emphasizes the ""deterrent effect."" It suggests that if an initial offense is met with an immediate and firm response (punishment or retaliation), it prevents future offenses by creating a sense of fear or respect in others.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A:** aligns perfectly with the idea of deterrence—punishing an initial act to prevent others from repeating it.
*   **B:** focuses on the timing of punishment for the wicked, which doesn't fit the ""self-defense/precedent"" theme.
*   **C:** suggests haste is bad, while the story suggests the snake was *too slow* to act.
*   **D:** mentions cleverness, but Apollo's advice was about a display of force/retaliation.
*   **E:** focuses on the sanctuary, which is merely the setting, not the lesson.

This fable (attributed to Aesop or found in the Babrius collection) is intended to show that those who do not resist the first injury invite further mistreatment, and that public punishment of an offender serves as a warning to others.

'I would agree,' the lion said, 'if you were not already in the habit of taking what",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions within the fable:

1.  **The Robber (The Villain):** He approaches with a demand, expecting a share through entitlement or force. The lion rejects him specifically because of his greedy and forceful nature (""taking whatever you want""). This represents **resistance** against those who bypass social or moral rules.
2.  **The Innocent Wayfarer (The Modest Man):** He approaches with caution and humility, showing no entitlement to the lion’s kill. In fact, he is prepared to leave empty-handed.
3.  **The Lion’s Response:** The lion rewards the wayfarer's lack of greed and his respectful distance (""modesty""), going so far as to divide the prize and leave so the man feels safe.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This directly matches the narrative. The robber takes by force and is resisted; the wayfarer is modest and receives generosity.
*   **B:** While the robber is untrustworthy, the story's focus is on the contrast between the two men and how the lion treats them.
*   **C:** The lion's ferocity isn't ""tamed"" by the man's kindness; rather, the lion chooses to be benevolent toward a modest person.
*   **D:** There is no evidence of cunning on the part of the wayfarer.
*   **E:** This focuses only on the robber, ignoring the central lesson provided by the lion's reward to the wayfarer.

The fable teaches that those who are greedy and demanding are refused, while those who are humble and unassuming are rewarded.

Since he was constantly paying out money and spending great sums on the offerings, the god came to him one night and said: 'L",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A man is performing excessive, expensive sacrifices to a shrine in his home. He is not being forced to do this; he is choosing to spend great sums of money.
2.  **The Consequence:** The man is ""squandering"" his wealth. If he continues, he will become poor.
3.  **The Warning:** The god appears and warns the man to stop. The god's specific reasoning is that if the man falls into poverty due to his own financial recklessness, he will likely point the finger at the god (or the act of devotion) rather than his own lack of moderation.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights a common human tendency: when we make foolish choices that lead to ruin, we tend to blame external forces (like fate, luck, or deities) rather than accepting responsibility for our own actions.

Evaluating the options:
- **A** directly reflects this lesson: the man is acting foolishly (spending all his money), and the god warns that he will blame the ""gods"" for the resulting ""misfortune.""
- **B** is about broken promises, which is not at play here.
- **C** and **D** touch on extravagance, but miss the central theme of misplaced blame.
- **E** suggests the offerings were insincere, but the god's warning is focused on the economic consequences and subsequent blame, not the quality of the man's faith.

Therefore, the moral is that people often blame divine or external factors for misfortunes caused by their own lack of wisdom.

1.  **The Conflict**: The stag evaluates his own body parts. He is ashamed of his thin legs but incredibly proud of his magnificent antlers.
2.  **The Action**: When hunters arrive, his thin legs (which he hated) provide his escape by allowing him to run fast across the plain. However, his antlers (which he loved) get caught in branches, leading to his capture.
3.  **The Realization**: In his final moments, the stag explicitly states the lesson: the legs he ""disparaged"" were his salvation, while the horns he ""boasted about"" were his downfall.
4.  **Evaluating the Options**:
    *   **A**: This directly aligns with the stag's realization. He underrated his legs, which were actually his most valuable asset for survival.
    *   **B**: While specific to destruction, the story isn't about ""greedy"" pursuit of honor, but rather the misjudgment of utility versus aesthetics.
    *   **C & D**: These do not fit the narrative arc of the stag's self-reflection.
    *   **E**: While pride is a factor, the core of the story is the inversion of perceived value (the ""useless"" legs being useful and the ""useful/beautiful"" horns being a hindrance).

But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Conflict:** An Eagle (a large, powerful predator) disregards the plea of a Beetle (a small, seemingly insignificant insect) and forcefully brushes her aside to kill a Hare.
2.  **The Action:** The Beetle, despite her size, seeks revenge for the disrespect and the harm to the Hare. She systematically destroys the Eagle's eggs, even when the Eagle seeks protection from the highest power (Jupiter).
3.  **The Resolution:** Jupiter acknowledges the Beetle's grievance as just. The final outcome is that the Eagle must adjust her nesting cycle because the ""weak"" Beetle proved to be a persistent and effective adversary.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) The weak may find a way to avenge a wrong.** This directly matches the theme. The Beetle is physically weaker than the Eagle, yet she successfully retaliates against the Eagle's arrogance and cruelty.
*   **B)** This focuses on greed and honor, which are not the primary drivers of this specific story.
*   **C)** While the Eagle lacked restraint, the story is more specifically about the consequences of underestimating a smaller opponent.
*   **D)** Beauty and leadership are not the central themes here.
*   **E)** There is no compassion between the predator (Eagle) and prey (Hare/Beetle) in this story; it is a tale of vengeance.

The story serves as a classic Aesop’s warning that even the most powerful should not disregard or mistreat those they deem insignificant, as even the small can find ways to retaliate.

At a certain m",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the progression of the fable:

1.  **The Accident:** The donkey accidentally falls into the water. Its salt load dissolves, which lightens the load. This is a stroke of luck for the donkey.
2.  **The Deception:** The donkey attempts to replicate this outcome by choosing to fall on purpose the next time it carries a heavy load. It effectively ""tricks"" the merchant to gain an easier path.
3.  **The Counter-Strategy:** The merchant observes the donkey's behavior and recognizes the trick. To address the donkey's laziness and dishonesty, he replaces the salt with sponges.
4.  **The Consequence:** The donkey tries to use the same trick again, but because sponges absorb water (unlike salt, which dissolves), the load becomes significantly heavier. The donkey is punished for its attempt at deception.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) You can fool someone only so many times:** This fits perfectly. The donkey successfully fooled the merchant once with a ""fake"" accident, but once the merchant caught on, the trick backfired.
*   **B)** This focuses on reputation, which isn't the central theme of the donkey's actions.
*   **C)** This describes the merchant's perspective but doesn't capture the overarching lesson for the reader/donkey.
*   **D)** This is overly complex and pessimistic and doesn't align with the specific cause-and-effect of the trickery shown in the story.
*   **E)** This describes the initial event (the accident) but ignores the merchant's retaliation and the ultimate failure of the donkey's scheme.

The story serves as a warning that repetitive trickery will eventually be discovered and lead to a worse outcome than if one had simply done their duty.

Even after stroking the animal he was not sure of its i,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Premise:** A blind man has a heightened sense of touch that allows him to identify animals. This suggests he perceives their ""inner nature"" or physical essence rather than just their visual appearance.
2.  **The Conflict:** He is presented with a young wolf cub. Even though the animal is small, young, and likely relatively soft or harmless-looking at that stage, the man senses something intrinsic to its nature.
3.  **The Climax/Resolution:** The man admits he cannot give the cub a specific species name, but he recognizes its fundamental nature: it is a predator. He notes that regardless of its current size or appearance, it is ""not the kind of animal that should accompany a flock of sheep.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The man recognizes the inherent danger or ""evil"" (in the context of a shepherd's flock) within the creature even in its infancy. This points to the idea that a creature's true nature or future behavior is present from birth.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The cub is young, but the blind man senses its predatory nature early on.
*   **B:** This refers to discipline, which is not present in the story.
*   **C:** While the man is blind, the story isn't about being fooled by appearances; it's about identifying an inherent trait despite the creature being a ""cub.""
*   **D:** The story does not involve rewards or punishments.
*   **E:** While plausible, it is less specific than A. The fable (traditionally attributed to Aesop) specifically focuses on the ""nature of the beast"" being visible from youth.

In traditional Aesopic collections, this fable (The Blind Man and the Whelp) is explicitly used to illustrate that a wicked nature is apparent even in the young.

This man noticed that all sorts of people came to him, and he became curious to see who were true friend",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"The story describes a man who provides food and hospitality to many, but finds that when he poses a hypothetical situation requiring sacrifice or risk (standing by him with swords in a quarrel), almost everyone vanishes. Out of a ""full table,"" only two remained faithful.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. **The Context:** The Rich Man is generous, which attracts many people. This sets the stage for distinguishing between quantity and quality of companions.
2. **The Test:** He creates a scenario of danger/conflict to see who is loyal.
3. **The Result:** The vast majority of people—who were happy to eat his food—refused to help him when it cost them something. Only two were loyal.
4. **The Lesson:** The story highlights that while many people will associate with you during ""fair weather"" (when things are easy and profitable), very few are genuine friends who will stand by you during ""foul weather"" (conflict or danger). This reveals the scarcity of genuine loyalty.

Evaluating the options:
- **A** captures the central outcome: out of a crowd, only two were real friends.
- **B** is irrelevant (seems to be a moral for a different fable about animals/life).
- **C** is a possible takeaway regarding the man's behavior, but not the primary lesson about the nature of the guests.
- **D** is partially true but focuses more on the psychology of the ""hangers-on"" rather than the overall truth revealed by the test.
- **E** is a strong contender, but ""sincerity"" usually refers to the host's trait; the story is specifically about the rarity of the friends themselves.

The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, 'Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch m",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the situation:

1.  **The Characters:** We have two pots—one made of brass (strong, durable, potentially dangerous) and one made of earthenware (fragile, easily broken).
2.  **The Conflict:** Both are being carried by the same river (life/circumstance), but they are not balanced in strength.
3.  **The Dialogue:** The Earthen Pot recognizes that proximity to the Brass Pot is a threat. Even a slight touch from the stronger vessel would shatter the weaker one. 
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that associations between the powerful and the vulnerable are often dangerous for the vulnerable. True safety and stable companionship are best found among those of similar status or strength, where one does not inadvertently destroy the other.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Equals make the best friends:** This is the classical moral historically associated with this Aesop's fable (*The Two Pots*). It highlights that a friendship between the ""strong/hard"" and ""weak/fragile"" is inherently lopsided and risky for the weaker party.
*   **B)** Focuses on ""overestimating worth,"" which the Earthen Pot does not do; it is actually very aware of its fragility.
*   **C & E)** These are modern, ""everyone is special"" sentiments that do not reflect the cautionary nature of the original fable.
*   **D)** ""Cautious abstain and dangerous enjoy"" is a distorted phrasing that doesn't fit the context of mutual survival.

The core message is that people should seek company among their equals to avoid the danger of being ""shattered"" by more powerful associates.

The wild boar replied, 'I have",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Action:** The wild boar is sharpening his tusks even though there is no current enemy in sight.
2.  **The Question:** The fox questions the necessity of this work, seeing it as a waste of time since there is no ""immediate need.""
3.  **The Rationale:** The boar explains that once danger arrives, it will be too late to sharpen weapons; he must be ready beforehand so he can act immediately.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace:** While ""war"" and ""peace"" are specific political terms, this is a classic expression of the general principle of being prepared for conflict before it happens. In the context of Aesop’s fables, this story is most frequently used to illustrate that we should prepare for danger during times of safety. 
*   **B) God is the ultimate judge:** There is no religious or judicial theme in the story.
*   **C) Curiosity must be guided by prudence:** This applies more to the fox, but the story's focus is on the boar's wisdom, not the fox's folly.
*   **D) Prudent men feel worst...:** This is overly complex and doesn't fit the proactive nature of the boar.
*   **E) Even nature prepares its own defenses:** While true, it is a literal observation rather than a ""moral"" lesson for human behavior.

Option A is the traditional moral associated with this fable (often phrased as ""Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace"" or ""Preparation for age and adversity should be made during the season of youth and prosperity""). It emphasizes that readiness is the key to safety.

morables_414,"A certain man took a deposit from a friend but intended to keep it for himself. When the depositor then summoned him to swear an oath regarding the deposit, he realized the danger he was in and prepar",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Premise:** A man intends to commit perjury (swearing a false oath) to keep a deposit that doesn't belong to him.
2.  **The Encounter:** He meets the god ""Oath,"" who tells him that he usually revisits cities to punish the wicked only every thirty or forty years.
3.  **The Transgression:** Believing he has decades before facing divine retribution, the man immediately commits the crime (swearing the false oath) the very next day.
4.  **The Consequence:** The god ""Oath"" reappears immediately to punish him.
5.  **The Lesson:** When the man challenges the god on his timing, Oath explains that while he *usually* takes a long time, he can return the very same day if provoked.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) There is no fixed day on which wicked people are punished.** This aligns perfectly with the story's conclusion. The man tried to calculate a ""safe"" time to be wicked based on a schedule, but the god revealed that punishment is unpredictable and can happen at any time.
*   **B)** This focuses on a ""crowd vs. individual,"" which is not present in the story.
*   **C)** This focuses on ""fear distorting truth,"" but the man's issue was lack of fear/presumption, not distortion of truth due to fear.
*   **D)** This discusses inciting strife, which isn't the central theme.
*   **E)** While thematically related to theft, the specific twist of the fable is about the *timing* of divine justice, making A a more precise fit for this specific Aesopic fable (often titled ""The Man and the God Oath"").

The story teaches that one should not assume they have time to escape the consequences of their actions; justice has no fixed schedule.

The brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their feathers, whe",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s look at the progression of the plot:

1.  **Initial Situation**: The farmer realizes the crop is ripe and decides to ask his neighbors for help. The mother Lark remains calm because she knows that relying on others' favors often leads to delay or lack of action.
2.  **The Turning Point**: When the farmer realizes the grain is falling (wasting) and decides to take matters into his own hands by hiring laborers and doing the work himself, the mother Lark recognizes that the harvest will finally happen.
3.  **The Lesson**: The story illustrates that as long as someone waits for others to do their work, the task is likely to remain undone. Real progress occurs when a person takes personal responsibility for their own affairs.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Self-help is the best help**: This aligns perfectly with the mother Lark’s observation. The harvest only moves forward when the owner stops relying on friends and takes personal action.
*   **B) Cunning often outwits itself**: There is no trickery or deceit in this story.
*   **C) Wisdom grows with determination**: While the Lark is wise and the farmer is determined, this doesn't capture the specific theme of personal responsibility versus relying on others.
*   **D) Do unto others...**: This is the ""Golden Rule,"" which is about ethics and social conduct, not the necessity of self-reliance.
*   **E) Even the tiniest cradle...**: This is a poetic sentiment about nature, not a moral lesson regarding the farmer's actions.

The fable teaches that you cannot rely on the charity or assistance of others to get your own important work done; you must do it yourself.

As soon as he realized what was going on, Aesop -- who w",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the logical steps and the central metaphor:

1.  **The Conflict:** A man mocks the philosopher Aesop for playing games with children, assuming that leisure or play is a sign of a ""crazy"" or unproductive mind.
2.  **The Metaphor:** Aesop uses an unstrung bow to illustrate his point. A bow is a tool meant for high-tension use.
3.  **The Lesson:** Aesop explains that if a bow is kept under constant tension (tightly strung), it will lose its elasticity or snap. It needs periods of being ""unstrung"" (relaxed) to remain functional and strong for when it is needed.
4.  **The Application:** The human mind and spirit are like the bow. Constant seriousness and work lead to burnout or ""breaking."" Play and rest are not signs of madness; they are necessary maintenance to ensure the mind remains sharp and ready for serious tasks.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Resting the mind is essential for clear thinking.** This directly aligns with Aesop's explanation that the ""bow"" (the mind/spirit) must rest to be ready for use.
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for.** This is unrelated to the story.
*   **C) Mockery often masks confusion.** While the man was confused, this is a byproduct of the situation, not the intended lesson.
*   **D) Be prepared to defend your witty, playful position.** While Aesop does this, the specific lesson he teaches is about the importance of the rest itself.
*   **E) Wisdom often hides behind playful appearances.** This is a valid observation about the story, but it describes Aesop's character rather than the universal truth he intends to teach with the bow metaphor.

Option A most accurately reflects the intended message regarding the necessity of relaxation and mental rest.

'I breed only one,' said the lioness, 'but he is very ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the interaction between the two animals:

1.  **The Sow's perspective:** She focuses on the **quantity** of her offspring, boasting about her ""whole litter"" compared to the lioness.
2.  **The Lioness's perspective:** She acknowledges she only has one offspring, but emphasizes the **quality** (""well bred"") of that single child (a lion, the king of beasts).
3.  **The Lesson:** The story contrasts a large number of common things with a single, superior thing. It suggests that producing one excellent thing is better than producing many mediocre or common things.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Quality is more valuable than quantity:** This directly reflects the lioness's retort.
*   **B) Gossips are to be seen and not heard:** This does not fit the context of the comparison of offspring.
*   **C) Confidence without humility leads astray:** While the sow is boastful, the core of the retort is about the status of the offspring, not just humility.
*   **D) It is good to set aside our proud disputes...:** This is a much broader moral found in fables about peace and war, not applicable here.
*   **E) Nurturing is key:** The story is about the inherent nature/quality of the ""product,"" not the process of raising them.

The most accurate lesson is that one high-quality item outweighs many low-quality ones.

morables_179,"Running swiftly, balancing on the razor's edge, bald but with a lock of hair on his forehead, he wears no clothes; if you grasp him from the front, you might be able to hold him, but once he has moved",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the imagery and metaphors used in the fable:

1.  **""Running swiftly, balancing on the razor's edge"":** This implies that opportunity moves very fast and is precarious; it does not wait around for deliberation.
2.  **""Bald but with a lock of hair on his forehead"":** This is a classical personification of *Caerus* (Opportunity). The hair on the forehead means you can grab him as he approaches you.
3.  **""Once he has moved on not even Jupiter himself can pull him back"":** The back of his head is bald, meaning there is nothing to grab onto once he has passed. Even the most powerful god cannot undo a missed chance.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The text explicitly states this is a symbol of ""the brief moment in which things are possible.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Seize opportunities when they arise.** This aligns perfectly with the imagery of grabbing the forelock before the figure passes by.
*   **B) Be content with your lot.** This is about satisfaction, not timing or action.
*   **C) Power without purpose is ineffectual.** While the text mentions Jupiter’s power, the focus is on the fleeting nature of time, not the nature of power itself.
*   **D) Boast of one powerful thing...** This is the moral of a different fable (likely ""The Fox and the Cat"").
*   **E) Every daring act teeters on the fine line...** While ""razor's edge"" suggests risk, the core of the story is about the inability to reclaim lost time, not the danger of the act itself.

The fable teaches that since opportunity is fleeting and impossible to recover once missed, one must act decisively at the right moment.

He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Fox's Behavior:** The fox identifies a danger (the trap) and waits. When the wolf arrives, the fox uses ""flattery"" and false generosity, calling the wolf a ""dearest friend"" to lure him into a dangerous situation. The fox is acting as a deceiver.
2.  **The Wolf's Mistake:** The wolf trusts the fox's words at face value without questioning the fox's motives or the suspicious nature of the ""free"" meat. 
3.  **The Outcome:** The wolf is injured by the trap because he trusted a known trickster (the fox) who was using feigned friendship to hide a malicious intent.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Flatterers and deceivers are not to be trusted:** This directly addresses the fox's false praise (""dearest friend"") and the wolf's mistake in trusting someone who was clearly setting him up.
*   **B) Know yourself and your limits:** This doesn't fit the context of deception.
*   **C) Trust can be a double-edged sword:** While true, it is less specific to the theme of ""flattery"" and ""trickery"" prevalent in fox fables.
*   **D) A single reliable skill...:** This is the moral for ""The Fox and the Cat,"" where the cat's one skill (climbing) saves it. Here, the fox's trickery actually *works* for her, while the wolf is the victim.
*   **E) Caution is wise...:** Collaboration led to injury here, not a new path.

Choice A best captures the lesson that one should be wary of those who offer ""gifts"" through excessive flattery, as their intentions are often self-serving or harmful.

1.  **The Promise:** One dung beetle promises to bring back food for his companion if he finds a good feeding ground on the mainland.
2.  **The Reality:** The beetle finds an abundance of fresh, moist manure. He eats his fill and grows fat, but he returns empty-handed.
3.  **The Excuse:** When confronted by the hungry beetle on the island, the fat beetle blames the ""nature of the place,"" claiming that while there was plenty to eat, it was impossible to carry any of it back.
4.  **The Lesson:** The beetle made a promise when he was in need of a plan for the winter, but once he was comfortable and well-fed, he prioritized his own appetite and offered a flimsy excuse for failing his friend.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Beware of empty promises made during good times:** This fits the behavior of the beetle, who spoke grandly of sharing but failed to deliver once he reached a land of plenty.
*   **B) We should not pick fights...:** There is no conflict or fight in the story.
*   **C) Curiosity can uncover hidden resources:** While the beetle found food, the story focuses on the broken promise, not the act of discovery.
*   **D) There's a curious time for work...:** The story does not focus on the balance of work and play.
*   **E) Even the smallest creatures find value...:** While dung beetles find value in manure, the core of the narrative is the social interaction and the failed commitment between the two beetles.

The fable teaches that one should be wary of those who promise to help or share when they themselves are seeking a better situation, as they often forget those promises once their own needs are met.

1.  **The Situation:** Two frogs are looking for a new home because their current pond has dried up.
2.  **The Opportunity:** They find a well with water, which seems like an immediate solution to their problem.
3.  **The Impulse:** The first frog wants to jump in immediately without further thought.
4.  **The Wisdom:** The second frog stops to consider the future consequences. If the well dries up just like their pond did, they would be trapped at the bottom because the walls are too high to climb out.
5.  **The Lesson:** One should consider the potential risks and long-term consequences of an action before committing to it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Look before you leap:** This idiom perfectly encapsulates the second frog's advice. It means to check for danger or consider consequences before taking an action. This is the classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable (""The Two Frogs"").
*   **B) Watch the actions of your enemy:** There are no enemies in this story.
*   **C) Haste often leads to regret:** While related to the idea of slowing down, ""Look before you leap"" specifically addresses the *forethought* regarding the environment and potential traps, which is the core of this specific story.
*   **D) Impulsive, vicious people...:** There is no ""vicious"" behavior or ""hurting of others"" in this story.
*   **E) Adaptability is key...:** While the frogs are trying to adapt, the story focuses more on cautious decision-making rather than the trait of adaptability itself.

The most accurate moral is ""Look before you leap.""

He saluted the gods who came to congratulate him one after another, but when he was approached by Plutus, the god of wealth and th",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Characters and Context**: Hercules is admitted to heaven because of his ""excellent qualities"" (his virtue/bravery). He is greeted by various gods.
2.  **The Conflict**: Hercules ignores Plutus, the god of wealth.
3.  **The Dialogue**: When questioned by Jupiter (the king of gods), Hercules explains his disdain. He identifies wealth as a ""friend to the wicked"" and a force that ""corrupts the entire world.""
4.  **The Core Message**: The fable contrasts Hercules' virtue (which earned him his place in heaven) with Plutus’ wealth (which Hercules views as a tool for corruption and a companion to evil). 

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Coffers of cash put a stop to honest traffic in praise**: This is the traditional moral of this Aesop's fable (often translated as ""The Riches of the Wicked""). It suggests that because wealth favors the wicked, it makes honest praise or recognition impossible or corrupted.
*   **B) Easy life and seeming good fortune...**: This focuses on the danger to the rich person, which Hercules doesn't mention.
*   **C) Wealth cannot buy true excellence**: While true to the story (Hercules earned his way via qualities, not money), it doesn't capture Hercules' specific criticism of how wealth corrupts others.
*   **D) Corrupting thieves...**: This is unrelated to the text.
*   **E) Virtue paves the path to the highest rewards**: While the story starts with Hercules in heaven due to his qualities, the primary conflict and the ""lesson"" provided by the dialogue focus on the nature of wealth.

In classical interpretations of this fable, Hercules avoids Plutus because wealth rewards those regardless of merit, thereby devaluing ""honest traffic"" or true merit-based recognition.

The dog summoned the wolf as his witness",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Conflict:** A dog and a wolf collaborate to deceive the justice system. The dog makes a false claim, and the wolf provides false testimony to amplify the charge against the innocent sheep.
2.  **The Outcome:** The sheep is unjustly punished based on these lies.
3.  **The Resolution:** Shortly after the injustice, the sheep discovers the wolf dead in a ditch.
4.  **The Lesson:** The sheep explicitly states, ""This is the reward that gods give to liars."" This indicates that divine or poetic justice has been served to the deceiver.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Wicked liars generally get their just consequences:** This aligns perfectly with the sheep's concluding statement and the wolf's fate.
*   **B) Harsh means vs. kind means:** This is irrelevant to the plot, as the sheep did not use ""harsh means"" against the wolf; the wolf died by fate/nature.
*   **C) Deception masks innocence:** While true, it is an observation of the plot rather than the ""moral"" or the ultimate lesson of the ending.
*   **D) Putting up with insults invites more:** The sheep was forced to pay; there is no suggestion that her behavior invited further insults.
*   **E) False claims unravel trust:** While a true statement, the story focuses more on the ultimate fate (punishment) of the liar rather than the social fabric of trust.

The story serves as a warning that those who lie to harm others will eventually face their own ruin.

'What have I done that I must die?' said she; 'I have stolen neither gold nor silver, but only a grain of corn to satisfy my ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** A Lark is trapped in a snare (a position of total vulnerability) and is at the mercy of the Fowler (the person who trapped her).
2.  **The Plea:** The Lark attempts to use logic and morality to defend herself, arguing that her ""crime"" (eating a grain of corn) is minor and does not involve the theft of valuable items like gold or silver. She is pleading her case as if in a court of law.
3.  **The Adversary's Role:** The Fowler is not an impartial judge; he is the hunter whose specific goal is to catch and kill the bird. He acts as both the captor and the executioner.
4.  **The Outcome:** The Fowler ignores the logic of the plea entirely. He does not ""deign any reply,"" showing that the Lark's arguments, however sincere or logical, are irrelevant to someone whose interests are fundamentally opposed to her survival.

**Analysis of choices:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The Lark tries to argue her case, but because the Fowler is the one who benefits from her death, her defense is futile. 
*   **B:** While the Lark died for a ""grain of corn,"" the story focuses more on the interaction between the captor and the captive rather than the risk taken.
*   **C:** This is the opposite of what happens; the Fowler's silence is merciless.
*   **D:** This is nonsensical in the context of the fable's events.
*   **E:** This is the opposite of the outcome; sincerity proved to be powerless.

The moral centers on the futility of pleading for justice when the person deciding your fate is the one who profits from your downfall.

Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this fable (Aesop's *The Wolf and the Nurse*), let’s look at the sequence of events:

1.  **The Premise:** A Nurse makes a threat to a child (""I will throw you to the Wolf"") that she does not actually intend to carry out.
2.  **The Inciting Incident:** A Wolf hears this threat and takes it as a literal promise of a meal.
3.  **The Reality:** The Wolf waits for the ""promise"" to be fulfilled. When the child cries, instead of being given the child, the Nurse calls the dogs to attack the Wolf.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Wolf believed the words of someone who considered him an enemy (or at least a threat). The Nurse's words were empty threats used for discipline, not a binding contract. 

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Enemies' promises were made to be broken:** This fits perfectly. The Wolf (an enemy) relied on the word of the Nurse (who views the wolf as a predator). The ""promise"" was never intended to be kept.
*   **B, C, D:** These do not align with the narrative of a false promise or the specific interaction between the Nurse and the Wolf.
*   **E:** While the words were harsh and intended to protect (by making the child quiet), this is a modern interpretation of the Nurse's behavior rather than the traditional moral regarding the Wolf's folly in believing an enemy.

Traditionally, this fable warns against trusting the words of those who are naturally opposed to you.

morables_186,"A bald man was bitten on the head by a fly and when he tried to swat the fly he gave himself a serious slap on the head. Then the fly laughed at the man and said, 'You wanted to avenge the sting of a ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the conflict between the man and the fly:

1.  **The Conflict:** The fly mocks the man for hitting himself, suggesting that the man is foolish for hurting himself in an attempt to ""murder"" a tiny insect. The fly views the self-inflicted slap as an ""insult to injury.""
2.  **The Man's Defense:** The man distinguishes between the harm he caused himself and the harm caused by the fly. He states, ""I can easily forgive myself since I know that I did not try to hurt myself on purpose."" 
3.  **The Core Lesson:** The man’s reply emphasizes that **intent** is the defining factor in assigning blame. He can forgive his own accidental slap because his intention was not self-harm, whereas he remains hostile toward the fly because its intention was malicious (drinking blood). Even though the physical outcome of the slap was ""serious,"" the lack of intent to harm himself makes it excusable in his eyes.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Intent matters more than the outcome:** This aligns directly with the man's argument that he forgives himself because he didn't mean to do it.
*   **B) Rudeness and sharing:** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **C) Forgiveness outshines mockery:** While he forgives himself, he does not forgive the fly, so this isn't a universal theme of the story.
*   **D) Frustrated self-effort:** This is overly wordy and misses the point about moral culpability.
*   **E) Anger causing more harm:** While a common theme in fables (e.g., Phaedrus often uses this), the specific dialogue in this version of the story focuses on the man's justification of his actions based on his *internal intent* rather than a warning against his own anger.

The focus of the man’s retort—which serves as the ""lesson"" or ""wisdom"" of the fable—is the distinction between accidental harm and intentional malice.

The Hunter agreed, but said: 'If you desire to conquer the Stag, you mus",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Motivation:** The Horse is driven by a desire for revenge against the Stag. He cannot defeat the Stag alone, so he seeks outside help.
2.  **The Trade-off:** The Hunter offers help but demands control (the bit, bridle, and saddle) to execute the plan. The Horse willingly trades his autonomy for the promise of victory.
3.  **The Result:** The Horse achieves his immediate goal (defeating the Stag) but discovers he has permanently lost his freedom. The Hunter now has the tools to keep the Horse enslaved.
4.  **The Core Lesson:** Seeking revenge at any cost often leads to a situation where the ""helper"" becomes a master. By surrendering power to another to settle a personal score, one often falls into a state of permanent subservience.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A** is close, but implies a general exchange of purposes.
*   **B** captures the essence of the ""lesser of two evils"": it is better to suffer a grievance without retaliation than to sacrifice your freedom to a third party to address that grievance. 
*   **C** and **D** focus on ""cunning,"" which isn't the primary point of the Horse's error.
*   **E** is a good summary, but **B** is the traditional, classic phrasing of the moral for this specific Aesop's fable (*The Horse, the Hunter, and the Stag*). It emphasizes that the ""remedy"" (the Hunter) was worse than the ""disease"" (the Stag's insults).

The moral is that in the pursuit of vengeance or assistance against a rival, we must be careful not to place ourselves in a position of powerlessness from which we cannot escape.

You have such ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Cat's Intent:** The cat wants the eel but doesn't want to get wet. He first tries flattery (""O most beautiful bird!"") to get the stork to open her mouth and drop the fish. When that fails, he switches to insults (""wretched creature,"" ""filthy bird"") to provoke a reaction.
2.  **The Stork's Reaction:** The stork recognizes that if she opens her mouth to respond—either to the compliments or the insults—she will lose her prize (the eel). She ignores the cat entirely and remains focused on her task.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the importance of not being distracted by outside noise—whether it is praise meant to manipulate you or insults meant to provoke you. By remaining silent and ""keeping her mouth shut,"" the stork successfully keeps her meal.

While the cat is certainly using flattery and deception (Options D and E), the focal point of the narrative's resolution is the stork's disciplined refusal to be distracted. She prioritizes her objective over the cat's provocations. Therefore, the most fitting moral is about maintaining focus.

'At the moment I am thi",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the outcome:

1.  **The Opportunity:** The wolf had a certain meal (the dog) right in front of him.
2.  **The Deception:** The dog used a clever promise (getting fatter at a wedding) to convince the wolf to let him go. This was a classic stall tactic.
3.  **The Outcome:** When the wolf returned, the dog was in a safe place (the roof) and essentially mocked the wolf for being foolish enough to let his meal go the first time. The dog made it clear he would never put himself in that vulnerable position again.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **B, C, D, and E** touch on themes found in fables (liberty, cunning, and mercy), but they don't capture the specific warning addressed to the wolf's mistake. 
*   **A) Take what you can get when you can get it** is the most accurate moral. The wolf had a ""bird in the hand"" but let it go for the promise of ""two in the bush."" The story serves as a warning against passing up a certain advantage for an uncertain, future promise. This is a common theme in Aesop's fables (similar to ""The Dog and the Shadow"" or ""The Fisherman and the Little Fish"").

The dog’s final line—telling the wolf not to wait for a wedding next time—emphasizes that the wolf's mistake was waiting instead of acting when he had the chance.

morables_222,"A gnat happened to land on the back of a camel and lingered there on top of the baggage. When he finally decided to disembark, he said, 'I will let myself down now as fast as I can so as not to burden",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the behavior of the characters:

1.  **The Gnat's Perspective:** The gnat believes his presence is a significant ""burden"" to the camel and that his departure will provide the camel with relief (""so as not to burden you any longer""). He views himself as having a significant impact on the camel's world.
2.  **The Camel's Perspective:** The camel is entirely indifferent because the gnat's weight is negligible compared to the baggage he already carries. He wasn't even aware the gnat was there, meaning the gnat's presence and absence are of no consequence to him.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This directly addresses the discrepancy between the gnat's self-importance and the reality of his insignificance to the camel. The gnat sees himself as ""consequential,"" but the neighbor (the camel) does not.
*   **B)** While the gnat is arguably arrogant, the focus of the fable is specifically on the inflated sense of self-importance regarding one's influence on others, rather than a general statement on ""influence.""
*   **C)** The story is not primarily about the camel's ""patience,"" but rather the gnat's delusion.
*   **D)** This misinterprets the camel's lack of awareness as a learned wisdom from ""misfortunes,"" which does not fit the text.
*   **E)** While true to the plot, this is more of a summary of the situation than a ""moral"" lesson about human nature.

The primary lesson of the fable (traditionally attributed to Aesop) is that people often overestimate their own importance or the impact they have on others.

The fox turned to the women and said, 'What shouts there would be aga",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the interaction between the fox and the women:

1.  **The Context:** The women are eating roasted chickens that belong to them (their own property). Because it is their own property, they are acting lawfully and peacefully.
2.  **The Fox's Grievance:** The fox observes that if he were to eat the chickens, he would be hunted, shouted at, and chased by dogs. He perceives this as an unfair double standard.
3.  **The Resolution:** The old woman points out the fundamental difference: the women are eating what is ""ours"" (their own property), while the fox would be taking ""things that belong to others"" (theft).
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that people have rights over their own property that others do not. An action that is perfectly acceptable for the owner of a house or item is a crime for an outsider.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This directly addresses the distinction between an owner's rights and an outsider's lack of rights over the same object. 
*   **B)** There is no friendship or betrayal in the story.
*   **C)** While the women are silent, ""outsmarting"" isn't the primary focus; it's a lesson on property rights.
*   **D)** This is about malice/cunning, but the story's climax is specifically about ownership and legality.
*   **E)** This is a literal observation of the scene but doesn't convey the ethical lesson (the moral).

Option A is the most accurate representation of the lesson: one shouldn't assume they have the right to treat others' property the way the owners themselves treat it.

morables_245,"A viper entered a blacksmith's workshop and bit the file, testing it to see if this was something she could eat. The file protested fiercely, 'You fool! Why are you trying to wound me with your teeth,",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the viper and the file:

1.  **The Characters:** A viper (a soft creature with teeth meant for flesh) and a file (a hardened tool made of iron, used to grind down other surfaces).
2.  **The Conflict:** The viper attempts to ""wound"" or eat the file. This represents an attempt by one entity to harm another.
3.  **The Resolution:** The file points out the absurdity of the viper's attack. Because the file is made of iron and is designed to gnaw through iron, it is immune to the viper's bite. In fact, it is the viper who risks harming herself by biting something so much harder than her own teeth.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates the futility of trying to hurt or influence something (or someone) that is naturally more resilient, ""harder,"" or indifferent to such attacks. It warns against attacking those who are ""insensible"" (unfeeling, impervious, or much stronger) to your efforts, as it will only result in harm to yourself.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A) It is useless attacking the insensible:** This matches the core theme. ""Insensible"" here refers to the file's nature as an inanimate, hardened object that simply cannot be harmed by a bite.
- **B) Words are no help at all:** Incorrect; the file uses words to deliver the lesson.
- **C) Curiosity without wisdom:** While the viper was curious, the focus is specifically on the *futile attack* on a stronger/harder object.
- **D) Foolish injuries:** The story is not about forgiveness or indignation.
- **E) Boasting of strength:** The file isn't boasting to start a fight; it is highlighting the viper's foolish choice of target.

The primary moral found in Aesop’s fables for ""The Viper and the File"" is that it is foolish to attack someone who is stronger or impervious to your attacks.

As they were disputing, they passed a statue carv",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the Man and the Lion:

1.  **The Conflict:** Both characters are boasting about their superiority.
2.  **The Evidence:** The Man presents a statue as ""proof"" of human superiority because it shows a human defeating a lion.
3.  **The Counter-argument:** The Lion points out that the ""proof"" is biased because it was created by a human. If a lion had been the sculptor, the statue would show a different outcome entirely.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that ""truth"" or ""history"" is often depicted from the perspective of the storyteller. A single piece of evidence or a one-sided narrative does not tell the whole story; perspectives change based on who is recounting the events or creating the art.

- **Choice A** (""One story is good, till another is told"") directly addresses the idea that a narrative seems convincing until a different perspective or counter-narrative is presented.
- **Choice B** focuses on bravery, which isn't the central theme of the statue argument.
- **Choice C** focuses on the consequences of pride, but the story ends with a philosophical point about perspective rather than a ""fall.""
- **Choice D** focuses on inner worth vs. outward show, which is a common fable theme but doesn't quite capture the ""point of view"" argument.
- **Choice E** focuses on cooperation, which is not what the Lion and Man are debating.

Therefore, Choice A is the most accurate moral for this specific fable.

On his way to the assembly of the birds, the peaco",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the motivations of the characters:

1.  **The Interaction:** The peacock is described as beautiful and courteous. Other birds (raven, crow, cuckoo) approach him asking for feathers.
2.  **The Transaction:** The peacock agrees to give away his feathers in exchange for having his ""praises squawked throughout the courts."" This indicates that his motivation is external validation and the desire to be praised (vanity/ego).
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he values the praise of others over his own physical needs, he gives away all his feathers until he is ""plucked completely bare.""
4.  **The Resolution:** Without feathers, he cannot protect his chicks or survive the winter. He eventually dies because he sacrificed his means of survival for a fleeting reputation.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Vanity can lead to self-destruction:** This fits perfectly. The peacock’s desire for praise (vanity) led him to give away his vital resources, resulting in his death.
*   **B) Do not boast to have something you do not:** The peacock actually had the feathers, so this doesn't apply.
*   **C) Opportunism can overshadow courtesy:** While the other birds were opportunists, the story focuses on the peacock's choice and the resulting tragedy for him and his family.
*   **D) Sorrow not over what is abandoned...:** This is a lesson about resilience, which the peacock did not demonstrate.
*   **E) True beauty shines through kindness...:** The story ends in death and failure, suggesting that his specific type of ""kindness"" (which was actually fueled by a desire for praise) was a fatal flaw, not a triumph.

The story warns that trading one's essential needs for the sake of public flattery and pride results in ruin.

1.  **The Conflict:** A small Gnat challenges a powerful Lion, claiming superior strength.
2.  **The Victory:** The Gnat outmaneuvers the Lion by attacking sensitive areas, causing the Lion to wound himself. This demonstrates that even the small can defeat the great.
3.  **The Hubris:** After winning, the Gnat ""buzzes about in a song of triumph"" (boasting/bragging).
4.  **The Downfall:** While basking in his victory over a ""huge beast,"" the Gnat is caught and eaten by a tiny, ""inconsiderable"" spider.
5.  **The Lesson:** The Gnat's lament highlights the irony—he defeated a giant only to be destroyed by a minor nuisance because he was blinded by his own success.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** captures the essence of the story: The Gnat’s bragging and sense of invincibility after a great victory led directly to his careless demise by a much smaller foe. 
*   **B** refers to a different fable (likely the Wolf and the Lamb or the Snake).
*   **C** is close, but ""frustration"" doesn't quite capture the fatal end the Gnat met.
*   **D** focuses on cunning outwitting itself, but the Gnat didn't outwit himself; he was simply caught off guard.
*   **E** is a general truth but doesn't address the Gnat's downfall.

The most accurate moral is that no matter how much you have achieved or how much you boast, you are still vulnerable to being undone by the smallest of things.

All of a sudden a tuna fish",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events:
1. The fishermen use their **skill** and effort for a long time but fail to catch anything.
2. They feel defeated and give up on their professional abilities.
3. A stroke of unpredictable **luck** (a tuna jumping into the boat to escape another predator) provides them with exactly what their hard work could not.

Evaluating the options:
- **A** reflects the central irony: the fishermen's skill failed them, but luck (an external, accidental event) provided the reward.
- **B** refers to the dangers of reputation, which isn't present here.
- **C** is too vague regarding the mechanism of the story.
- **D** is nonsensical in the context of the text.
- **E** contradicts the text, as the fishermen had actually given up and ""prepared to turn back"" when the fish appeared; it wasn't their perseverance that caught the fish, but an accident.

Not withstanding all his prayers, instead of becoming richer, he got poorer. Out ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the steps and the message:

1.  **The Premise:** A man is devoted to a wooden idol, praying for wealth. Despite his devotion, he becomes poorer.
2.  **The Turning Point:** In a fit of frustration (impatience and anger), he destroys the idol.
3.  **The Outcome:** The destruction of the idol—a violent and ""irreverent"" act—reveals the hidden gold that his prayers could not obtain.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The man realizes that the idol (the ""deity"") responded to force and violence rather than piety and prayer. He immediately shifts his attitude from worship to mockery based on the material outcome.

**Evaluating the choices:**
*   **A) People adjust their beliefs based on what is profitable for them.** This aligns with the man's change of heart. As long as he thought prayer would work, he prayed. When destruction brought gold, he immediately labeled the deity ""graceless"" and justified his violence because it was profitable. This is a common interpretation of this Aesop fable (The Man and the Wooden God).
*   **B)** This focuses on aesthetics and ""ugly things,"" which is not the core of this wealth-focused story.
*   **C)** The outcome was actually highly favorable (he got the gold), so it wasn't a ""graceless outcome"" in the sense of a negative result.
*   **D)** This is a nonsensical phrasing that doesn't fit the narrative.
*   **E)** While he was ""bold"" in breaking the idol, the specific irony noted in the text is the shift in belief and the futility of his previous worship compared to the profit gained from the act of destruction.

In many classical collections of Aesop's Fables, the moral associated with ""The Man and the Wooden God"" is that some people are so perverse that they do not respond to kindness or prayer, but only to force, or more broadly, that people's religious or moral convictions are often tied to their personal gain.

1.  **The Action:** A tiny gnat challenges a mighty bull. The bull accepts the challenge.
2.  **The Turning Point:** The gnat immediately claims victory not by fighting, but by the mere fact that the bull recognized him as a worthy enough opponent to accept the challenge. By engaging, the bull elevated the gnat to his own level.
3.  **The Commentary:** The narrator explicitly states that if the bull had been ""mindful of his own mighty bulk,"" he would have dismissed the gnat as ""beneath contempt."" Because he didn't, he gave the gnat something to boast about.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A:** Directly matches the text. By engaging with an ""unworthy opponent,"" the bull lowered his status and allowed the gnat to claim equality.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there are no children or education mentioned.
*   **C:** While pride is involved, the gnat didn't have a ""downfall""—he actually succeeded in his ruse.
*   **D:** Nonsensical in the context of the story.
*   **E:** The contest wasn't ""futile"" for the gnat (he got what he wanted), and the primary lesson is about the loss of reputation for the superior party.

The fable teaches that someone of high status or strength should not engage with those far beneath them, as doing so grants the inferior party an unearned status.

The owner began to question the dog, asking how he could be so ungra",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the dialogue between the owner and the dog:

1.  **The Owner's Argument**: The owner claims to be ""kind"" because he never personally struck the dog or spoke harshly to him. He uses this as proof that the dog was ungrateful for running away.
2.  **The Dog's Rebuttal**: The dog points out that while the owner didn't physically do the harming, he *ordered* others to do it.
3.  **The Conclusion**: The dog views the owner as responsible for the pain he suffered, regardless of whether the owner used his own hands or someone else’s. 

Looking at the options:
*   **A) What a person does through another is truly their own action.** This aligns perfectly with the dog's logic: assigning tasks to others does not absolve the person in charge of responsibility.
*   **B)** Although the owner is behaving hypocritically, the focus is on the action/responsibility, not just ""lurking danger"" in words.
*   **C)** This is the owner’s perspective, but the fable refutes this by showing that the owner was not actually kind.
*   **D)** This relates more to ""The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing"" or similar fables; it doesn't fit the themes of proxy actions.
*   **E)** This describes a plot point (the markings leading to the reunion) but is not a moral lesson.

The fable teaches that delegating a cruel task to someone else does not make the delegator innocent.

4.  **The Realization**: The last sheep realizes that their fatal mistake was failing to stand together and neutralize the threat early on.

Comparing this to the choices:
*   **A**: This directly mirrors the story's theme. The sheep failed to act while others were being taken, and eventually, there was no one left to help the last sheep. This is the classic lesson of collective security and the danger of indifference to the plight of others.
*   **B**: This refers to ""The Frogs Desiring a King,"" a different fable.
*   **C**: While the sheep ""faced the truth"" at the end, the lesson is specifically about the failure of solidarity, not just general wisdom.
*   **D**: This does not reflect the plot of the story.
*   **E**: The butcher is not someone they are trying to ""fit in"" with; he is a predator they are ignoring.

The narrative structure—individuals watching others perish while thinking they are safe, only to find themselves alone and defenseless—is a direct parallel to the sentiment famously expressed in the post-WWII poem ""First they came..."" by Martin Niemöller.

morables_131,"There was a hooligan who struck Aesop with a stone. Aesop said, 'Well done!' and he even gave the boy a coin. Then he added, 'Confound it, that's all the cash I've got, but I'll show you more where th",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the outcome:

1.  **The Action:** A hooligan commits a reckless act (striking Aesop).
2.  **The False Reinforcement:** Aesop rewards the hooligan with a coin, creating the illusion that a bad deed leads to success.
3.  **The Temptation:** Aesop encourages the boy to repeat the action on a more powerful target, promising an even greater reward.
4.  **The Ruin:** The hooligan, emboldened by his initial ""success,"" tries to repeat it and is caught and executed.

The central theme is that the hooligan was led to his downfall because he believed his initial mischievous act was successful and profitable. In Aesop's Fables (specifically the version by Phaedrus), the moral typically associated with this story is that petty success in wrongdoing often emboldens a person to take greater risks that eventually lead to their destruction.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Success leads many astray to their ruin:** This fits perfectly. The hooligan's ""success"" (getting a coin from Aesop) misled him into a fatal mistake.
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for:** The story isn't about wishing; it's about reckless behavior.
*   **C) Clever minds outwit reckless wealth:** Aesop is clever, but the target wasn't ""reckless wealth,"" the hooligan was.
*   **D) Avoid reckless overindulgence in manipulative pursuits:** This is too complex and doesn't quite fit the primary lesson of the narrative.
*   **E) Responding with grace can disarm hostility:** Aesop didn't respond with grace to disarm the boy; he responded with a trick to get the boy punished.

The most accurate moral is that initial success in a bad endeavor lures the perpetrator into a trap that leads to their demise.

1.  **Winter's Argument:** Winter boasts about being a ""dictator"" or ""despot."" Winter takes pride in the fact that it forces people to tremble, look at the ground, and stay indoors. This represents rule through fear, intimidation, and restriction.
2.  **Spring's Argument:** Spring points out that because of Winter's harsh nature, people want to ""get rid"" of it. Conversely, people love Spring because it brings freedom, pleasure, and beauty. The mere mention of its name brings joy, and people give thanks for its arrival.
3.  **The Lesson:** The contrast is between a ruler (or entity) that controls through fear and one that governs through affection and beauty. Winter believes its power over people makes it superior, but Spring points out that being a source of joy is more valuable because it earns genuine appreciation and devotion, whereas fear only earns resentment.

This aligns directly with the classic theme that leadership or influence based on kindness and being liked is more sustainable and desirable than influence based on tyranny and fear.

- **A) It is better to be loved than feared:** This fits perfectly. Winter's ""despotic"" power makes people miserable, while Spring's presence is welcomed.
- **B, C, D, E:** These do not capture the central conflict of the dialogue. The story isn't about blaming the wrong person, the waste of talent, or the hidden beauty of winter; it is specifically about the reception of their respective ""reigns.""

Everyone wondered at this, since the new horse was neithe",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Characters and Situation:** A soldier possesses an ""excellent"" (high quality, useful) horse. He purchases a second horse that is ""not nearly as good"" (inferior in beauty and utility).
2.  **The Action:** Despite the second horse being objectively worse, the soldier provides it with ""more care"" than the first.
3.  **The Observation:** Observers are confused because there is no logical reason based on merit or appearance to favor the second horse.
4.  **The Conclusion/Explanation:** The quote provided (""it's natural to be fond of the newest arrival"") suggests that the soldier’s favoritism is based solely on the novelty of the new horse, rather than its actual worth.
5.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A:** Deals with the fleeting nature of pleasure, but the story is more about the irrationality of favoring novelty over merit.
    *   **B:** Discusses satisfaction with one's lot and disaster; this is not relevant to the soldier’s behavior.
    *   **C:** The story actually shows the soldier ignoring usefulness and beauty in favor of novelty, so this contradicts the action.
    *   **D:** There is no evidence of ""wickedness"" in the text.
    *   **E:** This captures the central irony—that humans often misplace their priorities, giving more value or attention to something ""less worthy"" (the inferior horse) simply because it is new, while neglecting what ""truly deserves care"" (the excellent horse).

The theme of the fable highlights the human tendency to favor novelty over established value or merit.

morables_423,"A seagull having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die. A Kite saw him and exclaimed: 'You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no bus",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this fable (often attributed to Aesop), let’s analyze the narrative elements step by step:

1.  **The Event:** A seagull, which is a bird, tries to eat a fish that is too large for it. This results in a physical injury that leads to its death.
2.  **The Critique:** A Kite (another type of bird) observes the dying seagull. Instead of offering sympathy, the Kite points out that the seagull overstepped its natural boundaries. 
3.  **The Lesson:** The Kite argues that a creature belonging to the ""air"" (the sky) has no business meddling in the affairs of the ""sea."" In the context of ancient fables, this is a metaphor for individuals straying from their own station, specialty, or ""business"" to interfere in realms where they do not belong or lack expertise.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) Every man should be content to mind his own business:** This aligns perfectly with the Kite's commentary. The seagull suffered because it went outside its proper sphere (the air) to hunt in another (the sea).
*   **B) Learn from past misfortunes:** The seagull dies, so it cannot learn from its misfortune.
*   **C) Greed breeds misfortune...:** While the seagull was ""greedy"" in taking a large fish, the dialogue focuses specifically on the *source* of the food (the sea vs. the air), pointing toward the ""minding one's business"" theme.
*   **D) Supplying enemies with means of destruction:** This is the moral for ""The Eagle and the Arrow,"" not this fable.
*   **E) Patience is key:** This is not relevant to the plot.

The traditional moral associated with this specific fable is that people should stick to their own lane or sphere of expertise.

They urged one another to approach the river, but no one dared to get too close bec",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events in the fable:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of foxes is thirsty, but the river current is dangerously strong, leading to sensible caution among the group.
2.  **The Action:** One fox decides to show off. Her motivation is pride (""to embarrass her fellow foxes"") and arrogance (""Laughing at their cowardice"").
3.  **The Consequence:** Because her act was based on boasting and pride rather than a safe plan, she is swept away by the current.
4.  **The Resolution:** Even as she is in a life-threatening situation, she makes an excuse (""I've got a message to take to Miletus"") to cover up her failure and the fact that her boastful behavior backfired.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The fox's need to boast and appear superior led her to take a reckless risk that resulted in her being swept away.
*   **B:** There is no mention of profit or greed; the story is about social standing and pride.
*   **C:** The ""boldness"" did not quench anyone's thirst; it resulted in the fox being swept away.
*   **D:** While the fox was mocking, the ""cautious neighbors"" (the other foxes) did not suffer; only the boaster did.
*   **E:** The story portrays the fox's ""courage"" as foolishness and the other foxes' caution as wisdom.

The fable serves as a warning against those who put themselves in danger just to brag or show off, only to find themselves unable to escape the consequences of their vanity.

1.  **The Premise:** A lion attempts to act against his nature (predation) by being a fair king with a limited diet.
2.  **The Shift:** His natural instincts take over, and he crafts a trap based on a question with no ""correct"" answer: ""Does my breath smell bad?""
3.  **The Outcome for the First Groups:** Those who spoke the truth (it smells bad) were killed. Those who lied/flattered (it smells good) were also killed. This demonstrates that the outcome was predetermined by the lion's nature, regardless of the animals' responses.
4.  **The Monkey’s Case:** The monkey uses extreme flattery to avoid the first trap. However, the lion simply invents a new pretext (feigning illness) to eat him anyway.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **B, D, and E** are largely irrelevant to the specific plot points of the story.
*   **C** (Flattery can mask ruthless intentions) is a common fable theme, but here, the flattery came from the *victim*, not the predator.
*   **A** (The penalty for speaking and for keeping silent is one and the same) captures the essence of the ""Catch-22"" the lion created. Whether the animals were honest, dishonest, or sycophantic, their fate remained the same because the lion's predatory nature outweighed his ""resolution"" for justice. No matter what the animals said or how they behaved, the tyrant found a reason to destroy them.

This fable (found in the appendices of Phaedrus and other Aesopic collections) emphasizes that once a tyrant decides to act on his nature, the specific words or actions of the victims cannot save them.

The partridge immediately started squawking his usual song, sauntering through every room in the house un",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the behavior of the characters and the conflict between them:

1.  **The Action:** A partridge is newly introduced to a household. He immediately behaves with high confidence, ""sauntering"" everywhere and ""squawking"" loudly.
2.  **The Conflict:** The resident weasel (a natural predator, though here appearing as a long-term inhabitant) confronts the bird. The weasel points out a breach of social etiquette: the weasel, who has lived there for generations, remains quiet and humble (""I keep quiet and sleep beside the hearth""), while the newcomer acts as if he owns the place.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the arrogance of a newcomer who fails to observe the established order or humility required when entering a new environment. While the weasel is ""tricky"" (and likely mocking the bird before potentially hunting it), the dialogue centers on the bird's lack of modesty and failure to respect the existing ""household"" norms.

Comparison of options:
- **A** directly addresses the conflict: the newcomer failed to respect the hierarchy or customs of the home.
- **B** is irrelevant to the plot.
- **C** is incorrect because the partridge's confidence actually put him in a vulnerable position against a ""tricky"" predator.
- **D** is a strong contender (vanity leads to destruction), but the dialogue specifically emphasizes the ""right to speak"" based on tenure in the household, making the ""customs"" of the house a more precise theme.
- **E** is not supported by the interaction between the animals.

The most accurate moral, focusing on the social friction between the resident and the intruder, is that one should be mindful and humble when entering a new situation.

Stung by the sharp pain,",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** The fox is in a moment of vulnerability and reaches out for help instinctively.
2.  **The Action:** She grabs a bramble bush. By nature, a bramble bush is covered in thorns; it doesn't ""choose"" to be sharp, it simply *is* sharp.
3.  **The Conflict:** The fox is hurt by the thorns and blames the bush for being cruel, expecting it to behave against its own nature because she needed help.
4.  **The Resolution/Lesson:** The bramble points out the fox’s error in judgment. The bramble's very nature is to ""grab"" or snag everything it touches. It is a warning that one should not rely on something or someone that is inherently harmful or antagonistic.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the bramble's reply. The fox expected support from something that is naturally harmful/unfriendly.
*   **B)** This relates more to stories about luck or boasting (like the Hare and the Tortoise), which doesn't apply here.
*   **C)** While the pain stung, this is too literal and doesn't capture the ""lesson"" about who to trust.
*   **D)** This is the moral for ""The Fox and the Cat,"" not this story.
*   **E)** This is a plausible secondary lesson, but the core of the dialogue focuses on the **nature** of the person/thing being asked for help, rather than the general caution of seeking support.

In Aesop's fables, this specific story (The Fox and the Bramble) is traditionally used to illustrate that it is foolish to seek help from those who are known to be harmful.

But the fuller told him, 'How on earth would I be able to carr",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the roles and interactions of the characters:

1.  **The Characters:** A charcoal burner (whose job involves soot and blackening materials) and a fuller (whose job involves cleaning and whitening cloth).
2.  **The Conflict:** The charcoal burner proposes living together for convenience or companionship. However, the fuller recognizes that their fundamental natures and professional lives are contradictory.
3.  **The Logic:** If they share a space, the output of the charcoal burner (soot/black) will inevitably ruin the output of the fuller (clean/white). 
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that certain things (or people) are fundamentally different in nature and cannot be combined without one ruining the other. It highlights the incompatibility of opposites in a shared environment.

Looking at the options:
- **A) Opposites are utterly incompatible:** This directly reflects the fuller's reasoning that their tasks cannot coexist.
- **B) Appearances can be deceiving:** There is no deception here; both are honest about their trades.
- **C) Caution cleans inconsiderate actions:** While the fuller is cautious, this phrasing is nonsensical in the context.
- **D) Clean honesty is the best cautious policy:** Too specific and doesn't capture the core conflict of the trades.
- **E) Shared spaces require shared understanding:** While true, the story's point is that even with understanding, their incompatibility remains physically impossible to overcome.

The traditional moral of this Aesop's fable is that ""Like should associate with like"" or that opposites/dissimilars are incompatible.

Some travellers coming from the opposite direction asked the man how he",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Crime and Deception:** A robber commits a murder. When questioned about the blood on his hands, he attempts to shift the blame or create an alibi by involving a natural element—the mulberry tree—claiming the stains came from its fruit.
2.  **The Confrontation:** The robber is caught and executed on the very tree he used as his excuse.
3.  **The Dialogue:** The mulberry tree speaks, expressing that it is happy to assist in the execution because the robber tried to ""smear"" its reputation by making it an accomplice to (or the explanation for) his crime.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **B, C, and D** deal with equanimity, curiosity, and greed, respectively—none of which are the primary focus of the tree's grievance or the robber's downfall. 
*   **E** is a reasonable observation, but it doesn't capture the specific irony of the ""persecution"" or the tree's reaction.
*   **A** focuses on the reaction of the ""honest"" entity (the tree) that was slandered (blamed for the blood). The tree, representing an innocent party, does not hesitate to facilitate the punishment of the one who tried to tarnish its name. In the context of Aesop's fables (where this story originates), this specific tale (Perry Index 152) is traditionally associated with the idea that even those who are normally harmless or ""honest"" will turn against those who attempt to frame or slander them.

The tree’s statement—""It does not trouble me at all... since you tried to smear me""—directly supports the idea that the slandered party will participate in the punishment of the liar.

The lion woke up and immediately grabbed the wretched little mouse with his paw,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the progression of the plot:

1.  **The Act of Mercy:** The lion, a powerful creature, chooses to show mercy to a tiny, weak creature (the mouse) instead of killing it. At the time, the lion does not believe the mouse can ever help him; he simply decides that killing it would be beneath him.
2.  **The Reversal of Fortune:** The lion, despite his strength, becomes helpless when caught in a hunter’s trap.
3.  **The Repayment:** The mouse, remembering the lion's kindness, uses its unique abilities (gnawing) to set the lion free.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted:** This fits perfectly. The lion's ""small"" act of kindness toward a ""tiny"" creature eventually saved his life.
*   **B) Unequal matches bring misery:** Incorrect; the interaction between the unequal pair resulted in salvation, not misery.
*   **C) Cleverness can free the trapped:** While true in a literal sense, it misses the thematic weight of the lion's initial mercy.
*   **D) Those who act in their own innocent self-interest...:** Incorrect; the mouse’s actions were genuinely grateful and helpful.
*   **E) Even the smallest actions can awaken great consequences:** While somewhat relevant to the mouse running over the lion, it is too vague. The core of the fable (Aesop's ""The Lion and the Mouse"") is specifically about the cycle of kindness and how the small can help the large.

The story teaches that showing mercy and kindness to those ""beneath"" us can result in unforeseen benefits, as even the smallest friend may prove to be a great ally.

1.  **The Threat:** The Pigeons are afraid of a Kite (a bird of prey).
2.  **The Solution:** They seek protection from a Hawk (an even more powerful bird of prey).
3.  **The Outcome:** Once inside, the Hawk kills more Pigeons in a single day than the Kite would have killed in an entire year.

**Analysis:**
The Pigeons sought a ""remedy"" (the Hawk) to solve their ""disease"" or problem (the Kite). However, the Hawk proved to be significantly more dangerous and destructive than the original threat. The story warns against choosing a solution that inflicts more harm than the problem it was intended to fix.

*   **Option A** directly addresses this: ""Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease.""
*   **Option E** is a reasonable interpretation regarding choosing allies, but Aesop's fables are traditionally categorized by the specific ""remedy/disease"" or ""lesser of two evils"" maxim when referring to this specific story. Option A is the classic, most concise moral for this fable.

At first, the Earth refused to cooperate in Herm",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Origin:** Zeus creates humans and commands Hermes to integrate them into the world by teaching them how to farm (digging in the Earth).
2.  **The Conflict:** Earth (Gaia) initially refuses to allow humans to dig into her, resisting the exploitation of her resources.
3.  **The Compulsion:** Hermes utilizes the authority of Zeus to force Earth’s cooperation.
4.  **The Consequence:** Earth relents but attaches a curse or a price to the labor. She declares that while humans can take food from her, it will cost them ""groans and tears.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Easy gains often come with hidden costs and hardships:** The story emphasizes that the fundamental gain of human survival (food from the earth) is not ""easy"" or free; it is inextricably linked to labor, suffering, and toil.
*   **B) Do not fight with those who are perfectly capable of fighting back:** While Earth fights back with a curse, the core of the story is about the nature of human existence and labor, not a warning about picking fights.
*   **C) Power can sway the reluctant:** While Hermes uses power to sway Earth, this is a plot point rather than the ""moral"" or the lasting lesson regarding the human condition that the fable aims to explain.
*   **D) Powerful physical stature does not guarantee wisdom:** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **E) Guidance is the seed of self-sufficiency:** While Hermes provides guidance, the focus of the ending is on the ""groans and tears,"" emphasizing the hardship of that self-sufficiency.

The fable (attributed to Aesop) serves as an ""etiological"" myth to explain why human life is defined by hard labor and suffering. It suggests that nothing obtained from the earth comes without a heavy price of toil.

2.  **The Reaction:** Instead of simply being angry, the butcher acknowledges that he has learned a lesson (""I have taken heart from this lesson"").
3.  **The Consequence:** The butcher expresses that because of this experience, he will be vigilant and prepared to punish the dog if it attempts the same act again.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Experience teaches valuable lessons and encourages caution:** This aligns perfectly with the butcher's dialogue. He explicitly states he ""took heart"" (meaning he gained courage or a lesson) from the experience. He is now more cautious and prepared for future occurrences.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** While the dog acted according to its nature, the focus of the fable's resolution is on the butcher's newfound wisdom.
*   **C) Boldness without caution leads astray:** While true for the dog eventually, the story emphasizes the observer's (the butcher's) learning process.
*   **D) Better to face a bold danger...:** This is a moral typically associated with different fables (like those involving wolves and sheep).
*   **E) Desire can lead to actions that betray trust:** There was no established trust between the butcher and the thief.

The core of the story is the butcher's realization. In many classical translations of Aesop's fables (where this story originates), the moral is traditionally summarized as ""Experience is a good teacher"" or ""Misfortune is a lesson for the wise.""

morables_498,"There was a bullock who had been turned loose in the fields without ever having borne the burden of the yoke. When he saw a hard-working bull who was pulling a plow, the bullock said to him, 'You poor",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Characters:** We have a young, idle bullock and an old, hardworking bull.
2.  **The Conflict:** The young bullock mocks the older bull for his labor and suffering, feeling superior because he lives a life of leisure.
3.  **The Turning Point:** A sacrifice is prepared. The working bull is rewarded with rest (unyoked and sent to pasture), while the idle bullock is selected for the altar because he is fat and has not been ""worn down"" by work.
4.  **The Resolution:** The older bull points out that the bullock's lack of work was not a privilege, but a preparation for death. The bullock, who laughed at the bull's struggle, is now the one facing the ultimate misfortune.
5.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates a reversal of fortune. The one who seemed to be in a better position (and mocked others for it) ends up in the worst position possible. This aligns with the proverb that the final outcome is what truly matters.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) He laughs best that laughs last:** This fits perfectly. The bullock laughed at the bull early on, but the bull ""won"" in the end by surviving while the bullock faced the axe.
*   **B) The great do not always prevail:** This doesn't apply, as the bullock wasn't ""great,"" just idle.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers youthful naivety:** While true, it doesn't capture the irony of the bullock's death vs. the bull's survival.
*   **D) He that is neither...:** This is a nonsensical distracter.
*   **E) One should not judge others...:** While a good life lesson, the primary focus of Aesopic fables of this type is the irony of fate and the peril of idleness/mockery.

In many classical translations of this specific fable (*The Bull and the Bullock*), the traditional moral is ""He who laughs last, laughs best"" or ""Idleness leads to destruction.""

morables_174,It is common to take Maltese dogs and pet monkeys on long sea voyages in order to relieve the boredom of the passage. A man who was planning to make such a voyage had brought his monkey along with him,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let's analyze the story step-by-step:

1.  **The Premise:** A monkey is being saved by a dolphin who mistakes him for a human.
2.  **The Turning Point:** To impress the dolphin and maintain the appearance of being an important Athenian human, the monkey tells a series of lies. He claims to be from an illustrious family and, crucially, misidentifies the harbor of Piraeus as a ""dear friend.""
3.  **The Lesson:** The dolphin realizes the monkey is a fraud. Because the monkey lied and pretended to be something he was not, the dolphin abandons him (plunging him into the water).
4.  **The Conclusion:** The story serves as a warning against vanity and dishonesty. The phrase ""in deep water"" in Choice A is both a literal reference to the monkey's fate and a common idiom meaning ""in serious trouble.""

- **Choice A** directly addresses the monkey's behavior (pretending to be what he is not) and the consequence (ending up in trouble/drowning).
- **Choice B** is unrelated to the plot.
- **Choice C** contradicts the ending, as no ""helpful plans"" occurred; rather, a lie caused fury.
- **Choice D** is grammatically confusing and doesn't capture the essence of the monkey's mistake.
- **Choice E** is the opposite of what happened, as the companionship failed due to the monkey's lies.

Therefore, the most fitting moral is that pretending to be someone you are not leads to trouble.

morables_25,"A Certain House was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this, made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the behavior of the characters:

1.  **Initial Situation**: The Mice are being hunted and eaten by a Cat.
2.  **The Struggle**: Because they have suffered from the Cat's attacks, the Mice have become cautious and stay in their holes to avoid danger.
3.  **The Cunning Tactic**: The Cat attempts to deceive the Mice by playing dead (pretending to be an inanimate object).
4.  **The Resolution**: The Mice are not fooled. They recognize the Cat's nature and remember her previous actions. Even in a new disguise (a meal-bag), they refuse to trust her because they have already learned their lesson from her past behavior.

**Analyzing the Options:**
*   **A) He who is once deceived is doubly cautious**: This fits perfectly. The Mice have been ""deceived"" by the Cat's initial presence (or simply harmed by her) and are now so cautious that no trick, no matter how clever, will lure them out.
*   **B) Beware of when the powerful and the deceitful collaborate**: There is no collaboration in this story; it is a solo act by the Cat.
*   **C) Caution tempers cunning**: While true, it is slightly more vague than Option A. Option A specifically addresses the *reason* for the caution (past experience).
*   **D) Relying too much on cunning subordinates...**: There are no subordinates in this story.
*   **E) Unchecked problems invite opportunistic solutions**: This describes the Cat's entry, but not the ultimate lesson learned by the Mice, which is the climax of the fable.

The fable teaches that when someone has shown themselves to be dangerous or untrustworthy, a wise person (or mouse) remains wary of them, regardless of what new ""mask"" they wear. This aligns with the classic interpretation of Aesop's ""The Cat and the Mice.""

Just as he was about to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and wak",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the situation:

1.  **The Situation:** A traveler falls asleep at the edge of a deep well. His physical danger is a direct result of his own lack of caution/judgment.
2.  **The Dialogue:** Dame Fortune wakes him, specifically stating that if he falls in, people will blame ""Fortune"" or ""Bad Luck"" rather than his own foolish decision to sleep on the brink of a well.
3.  **The Lesson:** The personification of Fortune is making the point that humans often blame external forces (luck, fate, or spirits) for misfortunes that are actually caused by their own actions or lack of foresight.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Everyone is more or less master of his own fate:** This aligns with the idea that our choices (like where we choose to sleep) dictate our outcomes, and we should not blame external ""fate"" for our own folly.
*   **B) Every tale is not to be believed:** This is unrelated to the context of personal responsibility. 
*   **C) Guard your energy wisely:** While the traveler was weary, the story focuses on the *blame* and *responsibility* of the outcome, not the management of energy.
*   **D) He who incites strife...:** This is a moral typically associated with other fables (like The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner) and does not fit here.
*   **E) Exhaustion can lead to perilous oversight:** While true in a literal sense, it misses the central philosophical point made by Dame Fortune regarding accountability and the imputation of calamities.

Therefore, the core lesson is that humans are responsible for their own successes and failures, rather than being mere victims of luck.

The man took the handle and fitted it to his axe. The",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Request:** A man creates the head of an axe but cannot use it without a handle. He asks the trees—his potential victims—to provide him with the means to use his weapon.
2.  **The Action:** The trees, perhaps out of a sense of cooperation or misplaced generosity, provide him with a handle made of hard wood (wild olive).
3.  **The Result:** The very gift the trees provided (the handle) is used by the man to destroy them.
4.  **The Realization:** The oak tree realizes that their own contribution enabled their destruction.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This is a strong contender. The trees gave a tool to someone who could (and did) use it against them.
*   **B:** This focuses on being injured versus being in another's power, which doesn't quite fit the theme of self-inflicted harm through ""generosity.""
*   **C:** This captures the essence perfectly. The trees were ""generous"" by providing the wood, but they lacked the ""wisdom"" to see that the axe-head combined with that wood would lead to their own demise. This led to their eventual regret.
*   **D:** This suggests the trees were forced, but the text says they ""selected"" the wood, implying a choice.
*   **E:** This is about a ""quest"" and ""resolve,"" which is not the focus of this fable.

In traditional collections of Aesop's Fables, the moral of ""The Woodman and the Trees"" is frequently summarized as **""In yielding the first foot, we lose the whole field""** or, more commonly, **""He who provides the means for his own destruction has no one to blame but himself.""** Option C identifies that the trees' lack of foresight (wisdom) in their giving is the source of their ruin.

The crab said to her, 'O mother, lead the way, and I will try to walk accordingly.",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the steps and the interaction between the characters:

1.  **The Action:** The mother crab criticizes her son for walking crookedly and tells him he should walk straight.
2.  **The Reaction:** The son asks the mother to demonstrate the behavior (""lead the way"") so he can follow her example.
3.  **The Result:** The mother is unable to perform the very action she demanded of her son because it is contrary to her nature (and the nature of all crabs).
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the futility and hypocrisy of giving instructions or ""precepts"" that the teacher cannot or will not follow themselves. It suggests that if you want someone to behave a certain way, you must be able to demonstrate it through your own actions first.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) Example is more powerful than precept:** This fits perfectly. A ""precept"" is a rule or instruction; the story shows that the rule is useless if the example set by the teacher contradicts it.
*   **B) Contentment...**: Not relevant to the mother's criticism or the son's rebuttal.
*   **C) Those who cannot see...**: The mother isn't blind; she is simply physically incapable of walking straight. 
*   **D) Hypocritical equals...**: While there is hypocrisy, the focus is on the relationship between guidance and action, not ""best friends.""
*   **E) Even the crooked can find their way...**: The story ends with the mother failing and the son mocking her; they do not find their way.

The classic moral of this Aesop's fable is that one should not criticize others for things they cannot do themselves, or more simply, that leading by example is the only effective way to teach.

When the fox found out about this she paid a visit to the wolf a,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the themes:

1.  **The Characters:** Both the wolf and the fox are depicted as traditionally ""dishonest"" figures in fables. The wolf has a ""store of booty"" (stolen goods), and the fox is attempting to trick the wolf out of his loot through false flattery.
2.  **The Conflict:** The wolf treats the fox with spite, and the fox responds by betraying the wolf to the shepherd.
3.  **The Outcome:** The shepherd kills the wolf (one thief gone). The shepherd then lets the fox eat the wolf's food (the fox benefits from the wolf's destruction). Finally, the fox is caught by hunters and killed, expressing remorse for her crime.
4.  **The Overarching Theme:** This is a tale of ""the hunter becoming the hunted"" and criminals destroying one another. When the fox betrays the wolf, one ""thief"" is removed; when the fox is then caught, the cycle of destruction for the wicked is complete.

Evaluating the options:
*   **B, C, D, and E** focus on specific character traits (deception, gratitude, wit, isolation) but do not capture the systemic destruction of both villains central to the story's conclusion.
*   **A) Take pleasure when thieves destroy themselves** aligns with the classical interpretation of this Aesopic fable (often titled ""The Wolf and the Fox"" or ""The Wolf, the Fox, and the Shepherd""). It reflects the idea that when two dishonest or harmful entities turn on each other, it is a benefit to the righteous (in this case, represented by the shepherd and the hunters).

The specific realization of the fox at the end—""I am going to die, since I brought about someone else's death""—reinforces that the destruction of the treacherous is a form of natural justice.

1.  **The Conflict:** An Eagle and a Serpent are locked in a life-and-death struggle.
2.  **The First Good Turn:** A countryman intervenes to help the Eagle, saving its life and allowing it to escape.
3.  **The Act of Malice:** The Serpent, seeking revenge against the man, poisons his drinking water.
4.  **The Second Good Turn:** Recognizing the danger to his savior, the Eagle knocks the poisoned horn from the man's hand, saving the man's life in return.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
*   The core of the story revolves around the exchange of life-saving favors between the man and the Eagle. 
*   Because the man performed a ""good turn"" by saving the Eagle, the Eagle repaid the favor by saving the man from the Serpent's poison.
*   While option D mentions ""vengeful evil,"" the narrative resolution focuses on the Eagle's gratitude and the reciprocal nature of the kindness.

His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, My master gives a feast, a",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Invitation:** A guest (the stranger Dog) is invited not by the host (the Rich Man), but by someone who does not have the authority to grant official entry (the master's Dog). This represents an unofficial or ""back door"" entry into a situation.
2.  **The Assumption:** The stranger Dog assumes he is entitled to the feast and begins to act as though he belongs there.
3.  **The Consequence:** The person in charge of the resources (the Cook) recognizes the Dog as an intruder who has no right to be there and forcibly ejects him.
4.  **The Result:** The intruder is humiliated and injured because he relied on an invitation that held no weight with the actual authorities of the house.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. Drawing from a common idiomatic expression for someone who enters a place without proper authorization or through an indirect route (the ""back stairs""), it suggests that those who sneak into a situation or enter without the host's direct permission can expect a sudden and unceremonious exit.
*   **B:** There were no ""enemies"" in this story; it was a friend who gave the invitation.
*   **C & E:** These are too positive and do not reflect the cautionary nature of the Dog's injury and humiliation.
*   **D:** While the invitation was ""curious,"" the primary lesson focuses on the illegitimacy of the guest's presence and the resulting ejection.

The fable teaches that one should not rely on unofficial invitations or assume a right to someone else's property, as the true authorities will treat you as a trespasser.

He ordered that the bag of coins be brought to him as he was dying and then asked",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative elements:

1.  **The Character:** The protagonist is a ""miserly man"" with ""ill-gotten"" wealth. This establishes his character as someone driven by greed and unethical accumulation.
2.  **The Toil vs. The Outcome:** The man ""sweated"" over these coins, but the bag reveals that his effort was in vain. The wealth will be squandered by heirs on ""women and drinks"" (hedonism/waste), rather than serving any noble purpose.
3.  **The Spiritual Consequence:** Because the wealth was ill-gotten and hoarded, the narrative concludes with the man's soul being turned over to ""eternal torments"" by demons.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) A life of greed and hoarding wealth leads to misery:** While partially true, the story focuses specifically on the *source* (ill-gotten) and the *afterlife consequences* (torment) more than general ""misery"" during life.
*   **B) One chief vs. many:** Irrelevant to the text.
*   **C) Ill-gotten gains bring eternal torment:** This directly reflects the climax of the story. The bag explicitly states that the ""ill-gotten"" coins are linked to the demons ""who are going to turn your soul over to eternal torments."" This is a classic moral found in several editions of Aesop-style fables regarding ill-gotten riches.
*   **D) Unfamiliar things appear tormenting:** This is the moral for a different fable (usually ""The Fox and the Lion"").
*   **E) Fruits of toil may not yield intended legacy:** While true, it misses the specific spiritual warning about ""ill-gotten"" wealth and ""eternal torment"" which is the punchline of the dialogue.

1.  **Preparation**: The country mouse lives a humble, simple life eating acorns, but he is safe and unbothered.
2.  **Conflict**: The city mouse offers abundance and luxury (delicacies), but this wealth comes with significant danger and anxiety (the butler/human presence).
3.  **Resolution**: The city mouse is comfortable with the danger because he knows where to hide (""familiar mouse hole""), but the country mouse realizes the stress and fear outweigh the value of the food.
4.  **Conclusion**: The country mouse chooses his simple food (acorns) because it allows him ""freedom"" and security from fear.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A**: This matches the theme. The ""self-sufficient poverty"" refers to the acorns, and ""worries of wealth"" refers to the constant fear of being caught while eating the city delicacies.
*   **B**: Too general. While the mouse did learn a consequence, the story focuses specifically on the trade-off between safety and luxury.
*   **C**: This describes the city mouse's situation but isn't the *moral* or lesson the reader is meant to take away.
*   **D**: This is a completely different moral from a different fable (usually regarding ingratitude).
*   **E**: This is a summary of the plot's beginning, not a moral about the value of peace of mind.

1.  **Initial State**: The beetle is ""fully sated"" and safe in his original environment (the dung heap).
2.  **The Conflict**: Upon seeing an eagle, he develops ""contempt"" for his own nature. He makes arrogant claims—suggesting his voice and beauty are equal to the eagle's—and decides he is too good for his ""sorry state of affairs.""
3.  **The Action**: He attempts to leave his station in life to ""consort with the birds,"" ignoring his physical limitations (his ""loathsome buzzing"" and inability to handle ""strong winds"").
4.  **The Consequence**: He fails miserably, falling to the ground ""shaken and exhausted,"" far from his home and facing starvation.
5.  **The Realization**: He realizes that his pride was misplaced and that he would be much better off back in his original, humble position.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A**: This matches the plot perfectly. The beetle was ""arrogant"" and ""put on airs"" (claiming equality with the eagle). He failed to ""get promoted"" (reach the eagles' society) and lost his ""former position"" (his home and food source).
*   **B**: This is the moral of a *different* Aesop fable involving a beetle and an eagle (where the beetle destroys the eagle's eggs), but it does not apply to this specific story about social climbing.
*   **C & E**: These are too positive; the story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of overreaching and self-delusion.
*   **D**: This relates to physical confrontation, but the beetle's failure was due to his own weakness, not a battle.

**Conclusion:** The fable warns against the dangers of vanity and attempting to be something one is not, which results in losing what one already has.

1.  **The Conflict:** The man is faced with a ""lion of gold."" Gold is inherently valuable and inanimate, but because it is shaped like a lion—a predator—the man's cowardice prevents him from taking it.
2.  **The Struggle:** He experiences a ""war with itself."" His greed makes him want the wealth, but his inherent character (cowardice) makes him treat a piece of treasure as a physical threat.
3.  **The Solution:** Rather than overcoming his fear to claim the prize, he decides to stay at a distance and have others do the work.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that the man's fear renders the wealth useless to him in the moment. Even though the gold is harmless, his nature prevents him from enjoying the fortune placed right in front of him. He calls it a ""treasure that offers no satisfaction"" because his fear creates a barrier between him and the utility of the object.

Checking the options:
- **A)** accurately describes the central irony: the man has found great wealth, but his character (fear) makes it impossible for him to personally seize or enjoy it.
- **B)** is a common moral for other fables (like The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing) but doesn't apply here.
- **C)** is incorrect because greed and cowardice are working against each other; his cowardice is actually making him acutely aware of a ""danger"" that isn't there, rather than blinding him.
- **D)** and **E)** do not capture the specific intersection of wealth and fear presented in the text.

The fable illustrates that one's internal character (cowardice) can act as a barrier to enjoying external fortune.

When opinions were exchanged back and forth, the ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the hares and the lions:

1.  **The Context:** The animals call a meeting to resolve grievances. The hares, who are naturally weak and preyed upon, propose a system of total equality and shared power so that the strong cannot oppress the weak.
2.  **The Hares' Argument:** They argue for fairness and legal/social equality to protect themselves from being ""plunder and prey.""
3.  **The Lions' Response:** The lions acknowledge that the hares' words are ""good"" (they sound idealistic and noble), but they point out a physical reality: the hares lack the claws and teeth (the power) to enforce such a decree or to back up their demands.
4.  **The Lesson:** This fable (attributed to Aesop) illustrates the harsh reality that laws or arguments for equality are often ineffective unless those proposing them have the power or means to enforce them. Fine words and appeals to fairness are meaningless in the face of superior force if you have no way to defend your position or command respect.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Be prepared to defend your position:** This aligns with the lions' point. The hares' proposal failed because they lacked the ""claws and teeth"" to back it up. In a world of power dynamics, one must have the means to support their claims.
*   **B, C, D, E:** These either contradict the cynical reality shown in the story or represent idealistic views that the story specifically deconstructs through the lions' retort.

The story teaches that equality and rights often depend on the power to defend them.

There was a whole crowd of monkeys there and one of them ,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Context:** A leader (the chief monkey) is obsessed with status and vanity, mimicking human imperial rituals to feel powerful.
2.  **The Liar's Action:** He recognizes the monkey's vanity and feeds it with blatant lies (""You are the emperor,"" ""They are your chancellors"").
3.  **The Result of Flattery:** The liar is rewarded because his deception aligns with the ego of those in power. 
4.  **The Truth-Teller's Logic:** He assumes that if a lie earns a reward, the truth (which is objective and ""better"") will earn an even greater one.
5.  **The Result of Truth:** Because the truth exposes the monkey's lack of actual status (""You are simply a monkey""), the leader feels insulted and orders a violent retaliation.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Those who thrive on deception often retaliate against those who speak the truth:** This matches the narrative perfectly. The monkeys are living a lie (pretending to be an empire); when the second man breaks that illusion with the truth, they respond with violence.
*   **B) It is difficult to truly know a person:** Not relevant; the truth-teller knew exactly what the monkeys were.
*   **C) Flattery deceives the naive:** While true, the story focuses more on the *peril* of the truth-teller than the gullibility of the monkeys.
*   **D) Naive familiarity mollifies even the most terrifying things:** Not applicable.
*   **E) In the land of deception, truth is its own defense:** The story proves the opposite—truth was not a defense; it led to the man’s injury.

The fables of Aesop (this one specifically being ""The Two Travellers and the Monkeys"") generally serve as a warning that vice—or those who live by vice—will punish those who expose them with the truth.

This slave-woman, bedecked with gold and trailing a delicate purple robe aro",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the key elements of the fable (traditionally known as Aesop's Fables, No. 36 in the Perry Index):

1.  **The Characters:** An ""ugly, wicked"" slave-woman and a man who is inexplicably infatuated with her, treating her better than his wife and providing her with luxury.
2.  **The Misconception:** The slave-woman believes her good fortune and the man's attraction to her are a result of Aphrodite's blessing or a gift of beauty from the goddess.
3.  **The Revelation:** Aphrodite appears and explicitly denies involvement. She clarifies that she did not make the woman beautiful. In fact, the goddess is offended (""furious"") that the man finds such an ""ugly, wicked"" person attractive.
4.  **The Implication:** The man’s attraction is portrayed as irrational and unnatural. Ancient Greek morality often linked physical ugliness and wicked behavior with a lack of divine favor. If even the goddess of love finds the attraction offensive, it implies the man's judgment is warped or ""mad.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This aligns with the ending of the story. Aphrodite’s anger suggests that the man’s perception is an affront to the gods and a sign of a disordered mind.
*   **B:** There is no mention of a conscience or guilt in the story.
*   **C:** The man is generous, but the story treats this as a negative folly, not a virtue that ""outshines"" ugliness.
*   **D:** The slave-woman is not content; she is arrogant and combative toward the wife.
*   **E:** This is a modern sentiment. In the context of this specific fable, the woman is ""wicked"" as well as ""ugly,"" and the goddess rejects her entirely, suggesting no ""internal beauty"" exists here.

The classical moral appended to this fable usually emphasizes that when someone loves something foul, it is a sign of a ""distraught mind"" or divine displeasure.

morables_134,A father had an unmanageable son who indulged his vicious adolescent temper by brutally whipping the slaves whenever his father wasn't looking. Aesop therefore shared this little story with the father,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the narrative elements:

1.  **The Situation:** A father has a violent, unmanageable son who mistreats others (the slaves) when left alone.
2.  **The Analogy:** A farmer yokes a wild, dangerous young bull to an old, experienced bull.
3.  **The Purpose:** The farmer isn't asking the old bull to do heavy labor; rather, the old bull’s presence serves to ""restrain"" and ""check"" the younger bull's destructive impulses.
4.  **The Application:** Aesop tells the father that he must keep his son close by so that his own ""moderation"" (wisdom/calmness) can counteract the boy's ""reckless inclinations.""

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) ""A mild disposition can put a stop to vicious behaviour.""** While close, the story is specifically about the pairing of a mentor/elder to restrain youth. ""Moderation"" is the key.
*   **B) ""Do not mock the feelings of old age...""** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C) ""Wisdom tempers reckless aggression.""** This captures the core of the farmer's strategy and Aesop's advice. The ""old bull"" (the father/wisdom) is used specifically to ""restrain"" the ""young bull"" (the son/reckless aggression).
*   **D) ""Slow and wise steady wins the race.""** This is the moral of *The Tortoise and the Hare*, not applicable here.
*   **E) ""Unchecked behavior in youth can lead to greater harm.""** While true within the story, it is a warning rather than the central ""lesson"" regarding the solution (pairing the old with the young).

Option **A** is the strongest choice because it mirrors the specific language of the text: using the father's ""moderation"" (a mild/tempered disposition) to ""restrain"" (put a stop to) the son's ""vicious"" behavior. However, in the context of Aesop's themes, the dynamic of an elder's calmness tempering a youth's fire is the primary takeaway. Option A most accurately reflects the transformative power of the father's restraint over the son's violence.

All the other passengers started to swim, but the Athenian kept praying to Athena, maki",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Situation:** A ship capsizes in a storm.
2.  **The Action of the Athenian:** He relies entirely on divine intervention, praying and making promises to a goddess while remaining passive in the water.
3.  **The Action of the Companion:** He is actively swimming to save himself and advises the Athenian to ""start moving your arms"" while he prays.
4.  **The Lesson:** The companion is pointing out that divine help or hope is not a substitute for personal action. The story emphasizes that one must help oneself before (or while) expecting help from others or higher powers. This is a classic retelling of the proverb ""God helps those who help themselves.""

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Self-effort is essential:** This directly reflects the advice to ""move your arms"" instead of just praying.
*   **B), C), D), E):** While some (like C) touch on themes of the story, they do not capture the specific central moral regarding the necessity of personal exertion in the face of crisis.

The moral is that while faith or hope is fine, it must be accompanied by individual effort.

1.  **The Conflict:** The Frog and the Mouse are so consumed by their rivalry and their desire for ""sovereignty"" over the marsh that they commit to a fight to the death.
2.  **The Distraction:** Their intense focus on one another and their ""fair and open combat"" makes them completely oblivious to their surroundings.
3.  **The Outcome:** Because they are preoccupied with their internal struggle, they become easy targets for a third party (the Kite).
4.  **The Lesson:** The prize they were fighting for (the marsh) is lost to both of them because their infighting invited an outside predator to destroy them.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) When fools fight others run away with the prize:** This is a common interpretation of this specific Aesop's fable (*The Frog and the Mouse*). While the Kite ""takes"" the combatants rather than just the marsh, the essence is that a third party profits from the mutual destruction of rivals.
*   **B) People who do harm to others destroy themselves:** This focuses more on malice than on the specific vulnerability created by the fight.
*   **C) Stay vigilant:** While true, it doesn't capture the ""rivalry"" aspect that caused the lack of vigilance.
*   **D) Be observant before you make a predatory leap:** This would apply to the Kite, but the moral of a fable usually applies to the protagonists/sufferers.
*   **E) Rivalries can blind us to the greater dangers lurking nearby:** This is a very strong thematic fit, but in the traditional context of Aesop's fables, the most recognized moral for this story emphasizes that while rivals fight, a third party (the ""stranger"" or ""enemy"") benefits from their folly.

Choice **A** is the classic, established moral for this specific fable (often phrased as ""Weights and measures; or, when rivals fight, the spectator carries off the prize""). It highlights that the energy spent on the conflict allowed a third party to win everything.

morables_577,"A woman who had two daughters buried one of them, and mourners were provided to attend the funeral. The surviving daughter wondered to see strangers so much concerned at the loss of her sister, and he",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the narrative:

1.  **The Situation:** A mother has lost a daughter. During the funeral, professional mourners (strangers) are hired to cry and show grief.
2.  **The Observation:** The surviving daughter notices that the strangers are crying much more intensely than the actual family members.
3.  **The Explanation:** The mother explains that the family gains nothing from surface-level displays of grief (""never the better for crying""), whereas the strangers are performing because they are being paid (""the strangers have money for it"").

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Professional mourners serve those who pay the most:** This aligns directly with the text. The ""sorrow"" of the strangers is a transactional service, while the family's grief is private and lacks a financial incentive for public display.
*   **B) Often there is more good to be found in one man than in a crowd of people:** This does not fit the context of the story's focus on hired grief.
*   **C) Curiosity thrives on observation:** While the daughter is curious, this is a minor plot point, not the ""moral"" or lesson of the fable.
*   **D) Pragmatic temptation... compromise integrity:** This is too complex and philosophical for this specific Aesop-style fable, which focuses more on the cynicism of paid service vs. genuine emotion.
*   **E) Grief can unite strangers:** The story actually suggests the opposite—that the strangers' grief is fake and motivated by money, creating a divide between genuine loss and paid performance.

The story highlights the difference between genuine emotion and the mechanical performance of a profession. In many historical editions of Aesop's Fables, this story (often titled ""The Mother and Her Two Daughters"" or ""The Hired Mourners"") carries the lesson that outward shows of emotion are often deceptive, especially when money is involved.

'And for what cause,' he asked, 'have y",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Characters and Setting:** The story features a traveler and a personification of ""Truth."" Truth is found in a desert (wilderness), having abandoned the city.
2.  **The Conflict:** Truth is ""dejected"" and has isolated herself from human society.
3.  **The Reason:** When asked why she is in the wilderness, Truth explains that in the past, lies were rare (""among only a few""), but now ""they have spread throughout all of human society.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The core message is that Truth can no longer survive in civilization because falsehood has become universal or pervasive among all people.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Falsehood is with all men:** This directly mirrors Truth's statement that lies have spread throughout ""all of human society.""
*   **B) He who claims any good for himself...:** This relates to humility and divinity, which is not the focus here.
*   **C) Curiosity uncovers hidden truths:** While the man is curious, the focus of the story is Truth's exile due to pervasive lying, not the act of discovery itself.
*   **D) Even beneficial things all appear to be drastic...:** This is a moral typically associated with different Aesop's fables (like those involving medicine or surgical intervention).
*   **E) Compassion can be a guiding light...:** The man shows concern, but the climax of the story is a commentary on the state of honesty in the world, not the traveler's compassion.

Conclusion: The story laments the loss of honesty and the prevalence of deceit in the modern world.

As the ox stru",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A donkey and an ox are tasked with pulling a single shared load. The ox is injured but works hard; the donkey refuses to help.
2.  **The Consequence of Inaction:** Because the donkey does not share the burden, the ox is overworked and dies.
3.  **The Shift of the Burden:** Once the ox dies, the entire load—plus the heavy carcass of the ox—is placed upon the donkey's back.
4.  **The Final Outcome:** The donkey, now carrying the weight he refused to help with earlier (along with additional weight), collapses and dies.
5.  **The Lesson:** The birds explicitly state that if the donkey had helped the ox, he would have avoided his own death.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A:** This directly addresses the narrative. By failing to help his neighbor (the ox), the donkey eventually had to bear the neighbor's entire burden alone.
*   **B:** While relevant to the change in fortune, it doesn't capture the specific cooperative lesson.
*   **C:** Hard work did not triumph in this story; it led to the ox's death.
*   **D:** This is vague; the burden wasn't ""unhelpful,"" it was shared.
*   **E:** This focuses on ""true strength,"" whereas the story is a cautionary tale about the consequences of selfishness and the practical benefits of mutual aid.

The core lesson is that refusing to help those we are partnered with creates a situation where we eventually have to shoulder the entire problem ourselves, often with disastrous results.

1.  **The Premise:** Jupiter created Man in a hurry and forgot to include ""modesty"" in his internal makeup.
2.  **The Solution:** Since he couldn't add it individually after the fact, he released Modesty as an external force among the crowd.
3.  **The Conflict/Condition:** Modesty agreed to join humanity only on one condition: that she never has to be in the same company as ""carnal love.""
4.  **The Conclusion:** The fable ends with Modesty’s explicit statement: ""wherever [carnal love] comes... I'm gone.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Modesty and carnal love cannot survive together.** This directly reflects the final sentence of the fable and the central condition of Modesty's existence among humans.
*   **B) We must not require what is unreasonable.** This is a general moral found in other fables (like Aesop's ""The Donkey and the Lapdog""), but it is not the focus here.
*   **C) Haste can lead to unwelcome outcomes.** While the story mentions Jupiter was in a hurry, the central theme is the relationship between the two virtues/passions, not the consequences of the haste itself.
*   **D) Do not unmodestly mock...** This is unrelated to the text provided.
*   **E) Virtues shared are virtues gained.** This contradicts the nature of the deal, which was about exclusion, not general sharing.

The primary lesson described is the inherent incompatibility between modesty (shame/decency) and carnal desire (lust). When one enters, the other departs.

1.  **The Characters and Setting:** A fox and a monkey are traveling together. They enter a cemetery, a place representing the dead—those who are silent and cannot speak.
2.  **The Action:** The monkey makes a grand, boastful claim (""All these dead people were the freedmen of my ancestors""). This is an obvious lie intended to inflate his social standing.
3.  **The Observation:** The fox points out the convenience of the location. He notes that the monkey chose to boast in a place where no one is alive to contradict him or prove him wrong.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights how boasters and liars often choose specific circumstances where their claims cannot be verified or challenged (in this case, because the witnesses are dead).

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the fox's point. The monkey is a deceiver exploiting the silence of the dead (those unable to challenge him).
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there is no mention of old friends or new acquaintances.
*   **C:** Similar, but too vague. The story is specifically about the *opportunity* to lie without contradiction.
*   **D:** While the monkey is being deceptive, he hasn't yet found himself in ""deep water"" (trouble); the story focuses on the *nature* of his lie.
*   **E:** Too generic; while they are on a shared path, the core of the story is the boast made in the cemetery.

The most accurate moral is that those who lie often do so when they know they cannot be caught or refuted.

1.  **The Action:** A Farmer performs an act of pure kindness and compassion toward a creature in distress (the frozen Snake).
2.  **The Reaction:** Once the Snake is revived and feels better, it follows its ""natural instincts"" and bites the person who saved it.
3.  **The Result:** The Farmer dies, realizing too late that his kindness did not change the inherent nature of the ""scoundrel.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that some beings (or people) are inherently harmful or ungrateful, and no amount of kindness or charity can change their nature or prevent them from acting maliciously.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Correct. This aligns with the idea that even the ""greatest kindness"" (saving a life) will not ""bind"" (change or create loyalty in) someone who is naturally ungrateful or malicious.
*   **B:** Incorrect. The story shows the exact opposite—the man was rewarded with death, not gratitude.
*   **C:** Incorrect. Gratitude is absent in this story; the Farmer experiences regret because the Snake lacked gratitude.
*   **D:** Incorrect. The Snake did not ""forgive"" or ""forget""; it acted on instinct to harm its savior.
*   **E:** Incorrect. While compassion revived the snake, the story serves as a warning *against* misplaced compassion toward the dangerous, rather than an endorsement of it.

1.  **The Context:** The blacksmiths are engaged in loud, productive work (hammering). Despite the intense noise, the dog remains asleep, showing no interest or awareness because the work does not provide him with a personal reward.
2.  **The Shift:** As soon as the workers stop to eat, the dog wakes up at the ""slightest sound"" of tooth on food. This contrast highlights that the dog's ""awareness"" is tied entirely to self-interest (food) rather than the importance or volume of the activity.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story criticizes those who ignore the hard work or concerns of others but are suddenly very alert and present when there is a personal benefit (like a meal) to be gained.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This matches perfectly. The dog is unaware of the hammers (not his concern) but notices the chewing (his benefit).
*   **B:** Relates to agency/delegation, which isn't present here.
*   **C:** While the blacksmiths are diligent, the focus of the fable is on the selective attention of the observer (the dog).
*   **D:** Relates to tyranny (like the fable of the Wolf and the Lamb), which isn't present here.
*   **E:** This is a modern reinterpretion that doesn't fit the traditional moral regarding laziness and opportunism.

He greeted the unicorn and said to him, 'Let us put aside all that we have done in the past, because I am no ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the dialogue:

1.  **The Context:** The lion and the unicorn are established as ""chief enemies.""
2.  **The Deception:** The lion uses a vulnerability (feigned sickness) and a humble request (asking for a walking stick) to trick the unicorn into surrendering his only weapon and defense (his horn).
3.  **The Result:** Once the unicorn is defenseless, the lion immediately attacks him.
4.  **The Arguments:**
    *   The unicorn blames the lion's **treachery** and broken promise.
    *   The lion justifies his actions by stating that showing mercy or clemency to an enemy is a weakness that harms oneself.
    *   The unicorn retorts that victory through guile and perfidy (dishonesty) is not a true or honorable victory.

While the unicorn argues for honor (Option E), the narrative structure of the fable serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of the unicorn's actions. The unicorn's downfall was not a lack of honor, but his decision to trust a known enemy and render himself defenseless based on a ""humble and supplicating"" plea. 

Option A directly addresses the central mistake made by the protagonist: trusting an enemy who pretends to be harmless. While Option C is also true, Option A is more specific to the ""enemy"" dynamic emphasized in the first sentence of the fable.

*   **A) Be content with your lot:** This fits perfectly. The Pike had a great life as the Prince of the River but risked it all because he wasn't satisfied. The story ends with him returning to and accepting his original ""lot.""
*   **B) Value is what others think of you:** The story focuses on the Pike's internal ambition and physical struggle, not public perception.
*   **C) Strength without humility invites downfall:** While the Pike lacked humility, he didn't actually suffer a total ""downfall"" (he escaped), and the primary driver was his lack of contentment with his territory.
*   **D) Ambitious counsel without mighty help:** There was no ""counsel"" mentioned; the decision was his own.
*   **E) Leadership is about actions:** This is a general leadership lesson but doesn't address the specific theme of overreaching one's bounds.

The story belongs to a class of fables (similar to Aesop's) that warn against over-ambition and the failure to appreciate what one already has.

As soon as the ro,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the dialogue:

1.  **The Conflict:** Two soldiers are attacked. One flees (cowardice), while the other stays to fight (bravery).
2.  **The Aftermath:** Once the danger has passed, the coward returns, brandishing his weapon and making bold claims about how he would have handled the robber.
3.  **The Rebuttal:** The brave soldier rebukes him, pointing out that while his words sound courageous now, his previous actions (running away) proved his words are empty and his courage is non-existent.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Courage in words means nothing if you flee in danger:** This directly addresses the contrast between the coward's boastful talk after the fact and his flight during the actual crisis.
*   **B) There is little risk in being poor...:** This is irrelevant to the story.
*   **C) Bravery outshines cowardice:** While true, it is less specific than A regarding the deceit of the coward's words.
*   **D) Know your aggressive, unreliable enemies:** The story is more about a disappointing comrade than an enemy.
*   **E) Courage in adversity reveals true character:** This is a strong candidate, but the crux of the soldier’s speech is specifically about the **uselessness of boastful words** from someone who has already proven themselves a coward.

Option A most accurately captures the specific irony of the fable: that empty threats and bold talk mean nothing if one lacks the action to back them up when it matters. This is a classic Aesopic theme regarding braggarts.

They resented the fact that the Hoopoe had been given a higher seat of honor than the other birds because the Hoopoe was notable for its ,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative elements:

1.  **The Situation:** The Eagle (the king of birds) hosts a wedding and gives the Hoopoe a seat of honor.
2.  **The Reasoning for the Honor:** The Hoopoe is chosen for its outward beauty—specifically its ""crown"" and ""multicolored feathers.""
3.  **The Conflict/Reality:** The other birds resent this because, beneath the beautiful exterior, the Hoopoe’s actual behavior and character are base; it spends its time ""rolling around in dung and filth.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the disconnect between a shallow, attractive appearance and an unattractive, dirty reality. It suggests that honoring someone based solely on their looks (outward appearance) while ignoring their habits or character (deeds) is a mistake that causes resentment.

- **Option A** directly addresses this: ""True worth should be measured by character and deeds, not by outward appearances.""
- **Option B** refers to a different fable (The Eagle and the Beetle).
- **Option C** focuses on the emotion of the guests rather than the quality of the bird being honored.
- **Option D** and **E** are not supported by the text, as the Hoopoe is not noted for kindness, nor is the story about inclusivity.

The fable serves as a warning against being deceived by superficial beauty.

A swallow saw what the hen was doing and said, 'O you stupid, senseless creature! They w",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A hen (a bird associated with nurturing and domesticity) finds the eggs of a snake (a predator). Instead of avoiding them, she treats them as her own, brooding over them to help them hatch.
2.  **The Warning:** A swallow observes this and warns the hen. The swallow points out that by nurturing these eggs, the hen is bringing about her own destruction and the destruction of those around her.
3.  **The Logic:** Even though the hen is being kind and ""innocuous"" in her actions, the nature of the creatures she is helping (snakes) is inherently dangerous. Once they hatch, they will act according to their nature, regardless of the hen’s kindness.
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A:** This fits perfectly. The ""wicked man"" (represented by the snakes) cannot be changed by the kindness of a ""senseless"" benefactor. Trusting or nurturing evil leads to ruin.
    *   **B:** There is no ""grasping at more than they need"" (greed) in this story.
    *   **C:** The story suggests the opposite; devotion to a dangerous entity increases danger.
    *   **D:** There is no ""competition with superiors"" mentioned. 
    *   **E:** While the hen crosses natural boundaries, the story warns *against* this as a fatal mistake, rather than celebrating it as a transcendent virtue.

The fable (attributed to Aesop) teaches that kindness shown to the wicked is a lost cause and will ultimately lead to the benefactor's downfall.

1.  **The Situation:** The jackdaw is held in captivity. Although he is treated as a ""pet"" (a gift for children), he views this as slavery and a miserable condition.
2.  **The Action:** In pursuit of freedom, he escapes back to his natural habitat (the nest).
3.  **The Outcome:** The very instrument of his captivity (the string tied to his leg) causes his death when it gets tangled in the trees.
4.  **The Reflection:** Dying, the bird calls himself ""stupid,"" realizing that his struggle against his condition led to a much worse fate.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **B, C, and D** are irrelevant to the specific themes of the jackdaw's escape and subsequent death.
*   **E** focuses on the man's perspective (the gift), but the story ends with the bird's internal realization about his own choices and state of mind.
*   **A** addresses the core of the bird's lament. The bird's unhappiness was driven by his perception of his condition (""could not stand to live in human society""). By prioritizing his desire for a specific ""place"" or ""condition"" (the freedom of the nest) without account for the reality of his situation (the string), he brought about his own destruction. This fable is often interpreted as a lesson on how our desire to change our external circumstances can sometimes lead us into greater peril if not tempered by wisdom, and that our internal state (the mind) dictates our fate and happiness.

In many classical collections of Aesop's fables, this specific story (The Jackdaw and the String) is paired with a moral regarding how seeking to escape a bearable situation can lead to one that is fatal, emphasizing that the ""mind"" or ""judgment"" governs our well-being.

'Be careful, my friends,' he said, 'what if we all drown before the me",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of sailors is in a life-threatening storm. They are desperate for salvation.
2.  **The Action:** The sailors are praying to various intermediaries (saints).
3.  **The Intervention:** One sailor points out the inefficiency of this method. He argues that using messengers (saints) takes too much time and could result in failure if they drown before the message is delivered.
4.  **The Solution:** He suggests going directly to the source of power (God) who can act immediately without assistance.
5.  **The Result:** By taking the direct route, their prayers are answered and they are saved.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) The shortest and surest way of doing things is best.** This directly reflects the sailor’s logic. By cutting out the intermediaries and going straight to the source, they found the most efficient and effective path to their goal.
*   **B) It is better to be loved than feared.** This relates to leadership style (Machiavellian themes) and is irrelevant to the plot of the storm.
*   **C) Mercy tempers power.** While the calming of the storm could be seen as mercy, the focus of the fable is on the *method* of the sailors’ prayer, not the attributes of the deity.
*   **D) Not all pragmatic advice is diverse or wise.** The advice given in the story *was* wise and pragmatic, so this contradicts the outcome.
*   **E) Urgency in communication is vital.** While urgency is a factor, the story specifically highlights bypasssing intermediaries to reach the ultimate authority, which is better summarized by the ""shortest and surest way.""

This fable is a variation of an Aesop-style tale (often associated with ""The Sailors and the Saint"" or similar maritime fables), used to illustrate the efficiency of directness.

The mice who lived in the house were always being hunted down by either the snake or the weasel, so when they saw the snake and the ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Conflict:** Two powerful predators (the snake and the weasel) are fighting.
2.  **The Miscalculation:** The prey (the mice), who are normally hunted by both, assume they are safe because the predators are distracted by each other.
3.  **The Outcome:** The mice expose themselves. The predators immediately cease their internal conflict to cooperate (or simply shift focus) to kill the mice.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A:** This fits well. The mice (bystanders/secondary parties) suffer because they misinterpret the nature of the conflict between the powerful parties. 
*   **B:** While the mice were deceived by the ""appearance"" of safety, this is a very general moral and doesn't capture the specific dynamic of the story.
*   **C:** The mice were not timid; their boldness (scurrying around) led to their demise.
*   **D:** This choice, while phrased somewhat archaicly, captures the classic moral often attached to this Aesop's fable (*The Snake, the Weasel, and the Mice*). It suggests that those who are usually in danger are never truly safe, and when they let their guard down during others' conflicts, they become easy targets.
*   **E:** While technically true, the story is about the fate of the mice, not the ""peace"" of the home.

In classic interpretations of this fable (Perry Index 165), the lesson is that when rivals in a private feud see a common prey or common advantage, they will set aside their differences to exploit the weaker party. The mice's mistake was thinking the predators' conflict made them safe.

Option **A** is the most accurate modern summary of the mice's error: they inserted themselves into/became visible during a conflict between powerful entities and suffered the consequences.

'Well!' said the Boy, 'you'll regret it, because you'll never be as well cared for any",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the dialogue and the situation:

1.  **The Situation:** A bird has escaped from a cage where it was well-fed and cared for by a human master.
2.  **The Conflict:** The master attempts to lure the bird back by arguing that the bird will never be as ""well cared for"" anywhere else, implying that life in the wild is harder or less comfortable.
3.  **The Resolution:** The bird acknowledges that while the master provides comfort and safety, the bird prefers the autonomy of taking care of itself. The bird values its independence and agency over the material comforts and security provided by the cage.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) There is no wealth greater than liberty:** This aligns perfectly with the bird's sentiment. The ""wealth"" of the master's care is inferior to the value of being free.
*   **B) Treating people differently:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C) Defiance/Concern:** This misinterprets the interaction; the boy is offering comfort, and the bird is making a philosophical choice.
*   **D) Independent location/mind:** This is a variation of a different fable (The Caged Bird and the Bat) and doesn't fit the bird's preference for self-reliance.
*   **E) Freedom is a treasure worth pursuing, even at great risk:** While this is a common theme in literature, Option A more accurately captures the trade-off presented in this specific fable: the ""luxury"" of the cage versus the ""poverty"" (hardship) of freedom. In classical fables (like those of Aesop or Phaedrus), the preference for liberty over comfortable servitude is usually phrased as liberty being the ultimate ""wealth.""

The core lesson is that independence and freedom are more valuable than the finest comforts provided by a master.

The mole said to them, 'Silence your complaining, since you can see that I am deprived of eyes.'",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions between the characters step by step:

1.  **The Donkey and the Monkey:** Both animals are complaining about minor aesthetic or functional deficiencies (lack of horns and lack of a tail). These are matters of wanting more than what they have or desiring features they see in other species.
2.  **The Mole:** The mole interrupts them to point out a much more significant deprivation: the lack of sight (""I am deprived of eyes""). 
3.  **The Lesson:** The mole's intervention puts the complaints of the donkey and the monkey into perspective. By comparing their minor ""misfortunes"" to the mole's much greater one, the story suggests that people’s own problems seem smaller and more bearable when they realize that others are facing far more difficult circumstances.

*   **Option A** aligns perfectly with this analysis: ""Men would bear their misfortunes more patiently if they considered the ones of others.""
*   **Option B** is about cooperation and shared burdens, which is not the focus here.
*   **Option C** is a general truth about complaining, but it doesn't capture the specific element of comparison introduced by the mole.
*   **Option D** refers to karma or retaliation, which is not present in this fable.
*   **Option E** focuses on ""unique gifts,"" but the mole highlights a deficit (blindness), not a positive gift.

Therefore, the moral is that perspective on the suffering of others helps us endure our own.

The soup fell out of the long bill of the Cra",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The Fox plays a trick on the Crane by serving food in a way that is impossible for the Crane to eat (a flat dish). The Fox does this intentionally for amusement, ignoring the specific needs/anatomy of her guest.
2.  **The Crane's Reaction:** The Crane retaliates by doing exactly what the Fox did—serving a meal in a container (a long-necked flagon) that is perfectly suited for the Crane but impossible for the Fox to use.
3.  **The Conclusion:** The story ends by stating the Fox met a ""fitting requital"" (a deserved retaliation) based on the ""fashion of her own hospitality.""

**Analysis of choices:**
*   **A) Do unto others what you would have them do unto you:** This is the ""Golden Rule."" The story illustrates the negative inversion of this: if you treat others poorly, you should expect to be treated poorly in return. Because the Fox chose to be inhospitable, she received inhospitality. 
*   **B) Beware the sort of person who uses tricks:** While the Fox is a trickster, the story focuses more on the reciprocity of the act rather than a warning to avoid such people.
*   **C) Cleverness can outwit vexation:** This describes the Crane's action, but not the overarching lesson regarding how we treat neighbors.
*   **D) A clever alliance with the powerless is futile:** This does not apply to the context of the story.
*   **E) Consideration for others' needs fosters true hospitality:** While true, the story is specifically a tale of retribution/reciprocity rather than a guide on how to build ""true hospitality.""

The most traditional and accurate moral for this Aesop's fable is that one should expect to be treated the way they treat others (reciprocity). This is encapsulated by the sentiment of the Golden Rule.

1.  **The Context:** A husband suspects his wife is disliked by everyone because of her behavior. He sends her to her father’s house to see if she behaves differently or is perceived differently in a new environment.
2.  **The Observation:** Upon her return, the wife complains that even the shepherds and herdsmen (people who are out in the fields all day and barely interact with the household) looked at her with dislike.
3.  **The Realization:** The husband concludes that if people who barely saw her (the ""straws"" or small indicators) disliked her, then those who had to spend the entire day with her must have found her intolerable.
4.  **The Lesson:** Small signs or interactions can indicate a much larger truth or a general trend. If even a brief encounter results in aversion, it is a clear indicator of her character and how she is perceived in general.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Straws show how the wind blows:** This is a classic proverb meaning that small signs/incidents show the direction of a larger situation. The shepherds' dislike (the small sign) showed the husband the truth about her general conduct (the wind).
*   **B) Not all things are suitable for all people:** This relates to compatibility, but the story is specifically about behavior and reputation.
*   **C & D):** The story is not about curiosity or friendship.
*   **E):** While related to the theme of domestic life, it doesn't capture the specific logic the husband uses to judge her character.

1.  **The Situation:** A coachman's wheel is creaking (making noise/complaining).
2.  **The Observation:** The coachman notices that it is the ""worst wheel of the whole set""—the one that is doing the least work or is in the poorest condition.
3.  **The Irony:** The coachman expresses surprise that the wheel which has the least ""right"" or ""pretense"" to complain is the one making the most noise, while the stronger, more functional wheels remain silent.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) Complaining is the privilege of the weak:** This aligns with the classic interpretation of this Aesop's fable (""The Creaking Wheel""). The moral is that those who do the least work or are the least capable often complain the loudest.
*   **B), C), D):** These do not relate to the specific irony of the ""worst"" wheel making the most noise.
*   **E) Noise often masks vulnerability:** This is close, but the story focuses more on the *attitude* and *lack of right* to complain rather than a strategic mask for vulnerability.

In various translations of Aesop's fables, this story is used to show that those who are the least useful or the most troubled are often the most vocal about their grievances. While ""privilege"" in option A might sound modern, in the context of these multiple-choice options, it represents the idea that the ""weakest"" are the ones who resort to complaining.

The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, 'I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you'd gone right",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this fable (often attributed to Aesop), let’s look at the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Situation:** A jar is broken (an injury or damage has occurred).
2.  **The Response of the Jar:** It seeks legal recourse and a witness to testify about the damage. This represents focus on blame, litigation, and ""winning"" an argument or case.
3.  **The Response of the Woman:** She points out that the jar is leaking/broken and needs a ""bandage"" (repair). She suggests it would have been wiser to seek a practical solution to its immediate problem rather than focusing on the legalities of the mishap.

**Step-by-step analysis of the options:**
*   **A) Action is more valuable than arguments:** This fits well. The woman suggests that taking action to fix the damage (the bandage) is more valuable than pursuing a legal argument or testimony.
*   **B) You can't please everybody:** This is irrelevant to the story.
*   **C) Practicality triumphs over sarcasm:** While the woman's tone is sarcastic, the lesson isn't about sarcasm itself, but about the jar's misplaced priorities.
*   **D) Practical fortune...:** This is an overly complex and inaccurate reading of the text.
*   **E) Small actions can reveal hidden strengths:** The story focuses on repairing damage rather than discovering strengths.

The core lesson is that when a problem occurs, it is better to spend one's energy on fixing the damage (practical action) than on seeking witnesses or winning a dispute (arguments/litigation).

When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** Two powerful, majestic groups (Dolphins and Whales) are engaged in a serious and destructive conflict.
2.  **The Intervention:** A Sprat (a very small, insignificant fish) offers to act as an umpire or mediator to reconcile their differences.
3.  **The Reaction:** The Dolphins reject the offer immediately. Their reasoning is not that they love fighting, but that they find the idea of an insignificant creature interfering in their ""grand"" affairs more offensive than the prospect of mutual destruction.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that proud or significant individuals often look down upon those they deem inferior. They would rather suffer the consequences of their pride (continued war/destruction) than allow someone they consider ""beneath"" them to mediate or influence their business. While ""unnecessary conflict"" is mentioned in option C, the core of the dolphin's statement focuses on the **pride** and the **refusal to accept help from the insignificant**.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** is too broad.
*   **B** is irrelevant to the text.
*   **C** captures the essence of pride and the refusal of mediation. In many traditional collections of Aesop's Fables, the moral associated with ""The Dolphin and the Whale"" (or ""The Sprat and the Dolphin"") is that insignificant people are often held in contempt by the powerful, even when offering help. Option C captures the role of **Pride** being the barrier to peace.
*   **D** is a general statement not supported by the dialogue.
*   **E** focuses on mutual ruin, which is a symptom, but the *point* of the dialogue is the rejection of the ""lowly"" mediator.

1.  **The Narrative Conflict:** A Man and a Satyr form an alliance. However, the Satyr becomes suspicious because he observes the Man using the same physical action (blowing breath) to achieve two diametrically opposed results: warming his hands and cooling his food.
2.  **The Satyr's Interpretation:** The Satyr views this inconsistency as a sign of duplicity or double-mindedness. To him, someone who can ""blow hot and cold"" using the same mouth is unreliable and inconsistent.
3.  **The Figurative Meaning:** The phrase ""to blow hot and cold"" has become a common idiom derived from this specific Aesop's fable. It describes a person who is inconsistent in their opinions, loyalties, or messages—someone who says one thing at one moment and the opposite at another to suit their immediate needs.

    *   **A:** Directly addresses the metaphorical implication of the Satyr’s observation. If a person can swing between extremes (blowing hot and cold), they are perceived as untrustworthy or two-faced.
    *   **B:** Relates to greed or foresight, which is not present here.
    *   **C:** While the Man is being ""adaptable"" in a physical sense, the Satyr rejects this as a vice of inconsistency.
    *   **D:** This is overly complex and does not fit the central theme of the breath.
    *   **E:** This is a general moral, but A is the specific traditional moral associated with ""blowing hot and cold.""

The Satyr terminates the friendship because he cannot trust someone whose output changes so drastically based on circumstance.

1.  **The Context:** The story describes Socrates building a very small, modest house. A neighbor questions why a man of his stature would build something so tiny.
2.  **Socrates' Response:** He replies, ""If only I could fill it with true friends!"" 
3.  **The Implication:** By stating that even a tiny house is difficult to fill with ""true friends,"" Socrates is implying that genuine, loyal friends are incredibly rare. If true friends were common, he would need a much larger house to accommodate them; because they are so scarce, even a tiny house is more than enough space.
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A) True friends are hard to find:** This aligns perfectly with the punchline of the fable.
    *   **B) Guilty conscience:** There is no mention of guilt or conscience in the story.
    *   **C) Curiosity fuels wisdom:** While a neighbor asks a question, the story focuses on the rarity of friendship, not the pursuit of knowledge.
    *   **D) Modest wise man:** This is a meta-commentary on the narrator or the Greek tradition, but not the moral lesson Socrates provides.
    *   **E) Enduring hardships:** While the narrator mentions dying like Socrates, the core of the dialogue (the fable itself) is about the house and the friends.

The moral, as traditionally understood from Phaedrus (who recorded this version of the Aesopic fable), is that while many people claim to be friends, true friendship is extremely rare.

morables_122,"The lion often found fault with the way he had been designed by Prometheus. Admittedly, Prometheus had made the lion very large and handsome, supplying him with sharp fangs in his jaw and arming him w",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative progression:

1.  **The Lion's Problem:** Despite being the most powerful and handsome animal, the lion is obsessed with his single minor weakness (a fear of roosters). He is so ashamed of this flaw that he considers suicide.
2.  **The Comparison:** The lion encounters the elephant, a creature even larger and more impressive than himself.
3.  **The Realization:** He discovers that the elephant—despite his massive size—is terrified of something far smaller and more insignificant (a gnat). 
4.  **The Conclusion:** The lion realizes that every creature has its own vulnerabilities. Upon seeing the elephant's struggle with a ""lesser"" threat, the lion feels better about his own situation and regains his self-worth.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) There is always someone else worse off than you.** This fits perfectly. The lion finds perspective by seeing that even the mighty elephant has a fear that seems even more absurd (a gnat vs. a rooster), leading him to conclude he is ""in much better shape.""
*   **B) No matter how you brag...** The lion wasn't bragging; he was self-deprecating.
*   **C) Strength alone does not guarantee invulnerability.** While true in the story, the *lesson* the lion learns is not about caution or vulnerability, but about finding comfort/perspective by comparing his lot to others.
*   **D) You may share the labours...** This refers to a completely different fable (The Lion's Share).
*   **E) Even divine gifts...** The lion wasn't envious of others' gifts; he was unhappy with his own.

The core of the story is the lion's shift from suicidal despair to self-acceptance upon realizing that even the grandest creatures face similar or worse trivial fears.

morables_169,"The crow was making a sacrifice to Athena and invited a dog to the feast. The dog said to her, 'Why do you foolishly squander these sacrifices? The goddess clearly hates you so much that she has taken",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the interaction between the crow and the dog:

1.  **The Context**: In Greek mythology and folklore, the crow was often seen as an omen-bearer. However, the dog points out that the crow's omens have lost their credibility, suggesting that Athena (to whom the crow is sacrificing) has turned against the crow.
2.  **The Conflict**: The dog views the sacrifice as a waste of resources because the goddess is hostile to the crow. The dog expresses skepticism and pragmatism.
3.  **The Resolution**: The crow explains that her persistent sacrifice is a calculated move. Because the goddess is currently her ""enemy"" (or at least ill-disposed toward her), the crow is treating the goddess with extra honor specifically to change her mind and regain favor.

**Evaluating the choices:**
*   **A) People are often eager to treat their enemies well in the hopes of gaining something by it:** This aligns perfectly with the crow's logic. She recognizes the goddess's hostility but uses ""gifts"" (sacrifices) to appease and manipulate that hostility into a favorable outcome.
*   **B) Pick your enemies:** The story is about how to handle an existing enemy, not how to choose one.
*   **C) Hope shines through skepticism:** While the crow is hopeful, the fable specifically highlights the tactical use of generosity toward an adversary.
*   **D) A hopeful, wise person will not attempt anything without having the critical means to achieve it:** The story doesn't focus on the ""means"" so much as the motivation for the action.
*   **E) Generosity can forge unlikely friendships:** The crow is sacrificing to a goddess, not trying to become friends with the dog, and the goal is regaining professional ""credibility,"" not a personal bond.

The crow’s behavior exemplifies the diplomatic or self-interested strategy of bribing or honoring those who are ill-disposed toward us to win them over (or ""gain something"" like credibility). This matches the traditional interpretation of this Aesopic fable.

The story goes that when a male hyena was treating a female badly, she said to him",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"In this fable, derived from the tradition of Aesop, the lesson centers on the reversal of roles and the consequences of one's actions when the balance of power shifts.

**Step-by-step thinking:**
1.  **The Premise:** The fable relies on the (mythological) belief that the hyena changes gender from male to female and back again.
2.  **The Conflict:** A male hyena is mistreating a female hyena. He holds the dominant or ""higher"" position in this specific moment.
3.  **The Warning:** The female reminds the male that their roles will soon be reversed. She is essentially saying, ""The way you treat me now is how I will be empowered to treat you later.""
4.  **The Lesson:** This story warns those in power (or those in a position to judge/mistreat others) to be careful, as they may eventually find themselves in the subordinate position, subject to the same treatment they once dealt out.
5.  **Alignment with Options:** 
    *   **Option A** describes a reversal of roles where the one currently being ""judged"" or mistreated will eventually be in the position of the one ""judging"" or exerting power. While ""teachers"" is a specific metaphor for ""those in authority,"" it best captures the essence of the shift in power and the warning against current arrogance. 
    *   Options B, C, D, and E focus on secondary traits (deceit, adversity, mistrust, or potential) that are not the primary focus of the female hyena's specific warning about the future reversal of status.

In many classical translations of this fable, the moral is explicitly stated as a warning to those in office or power: ""Do not mistreat those under you, for you may soon be under them."" Option A is the closest fit to this traditional interpretation.

The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable ""The Lion and the Dolphin,"" let’s look at the sequence of events and the failed outcome:

1.  **The Proposition:** The Lion seeks an alliance based on status (""King of the land"" meets ""King of the sea""). He assumes that because they are both powerful rulers, they are ideal partners.
2.  **The Conflict:** The Lion enters a fight (with the wild bull) and calls upon his ally for help.
3.  **The Failure:** The Dolphin wants to help but is physically unable to leave the water. His ""nature"" prevents him from assisting.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Lion feels betrayed, but the Dolphin points out that the fault lies in the nature of the alliance itself. The Lion chose an ally who, regardless of status or intent, could not provide practical help in the environment where the Lion operates.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the practical failure of the story. The Lion chose a friend he liked/respected, but one who was incapable of helping him in his moment of peril (land battles).
*   **B:** Incorrect because the Dolphin did not *want* to betray the Lion; he was simply incapable of helping.
*   **C:** This focuses on the adversary (the bull), whereas the story focuses on the failed alliance.
*   **D:** This is a generic platitude not supported by the story's outcome.
*   **E:** While somewhat true, it is less specific than A. The core issue wasn't the ""titles,"" but the physical inability to offer aid.

In classical Aesop’s fables, this specific story is traditionally used to illustrate that when choosing allies, one must consider their ability to actually provide assistance during a crisis.

The fox then ask",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the text step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation**: A fox (predator) tries to trick a cicada (prey) into coming down from a safe height by using flattery.
2.  **The Response**: The cicada is not fooled. Instead of falling for the trap, he tests the fox by dropping a leaf, confirming the fox's predatory intent when the fox pounces on it.
3.  **The Lesson Source**: The cicada explicitly states *why* he was prepared: ""I've been on my guard against foxes ever since I saw the wings of a cicada in the spoor of a fox."" 
4.  **The Core Message**: The cicada learned to be cautious and wise not through his own near-death experience, but by observing what happened to others of his kind (seeing their wings in the fox's droppings).

Evaluating the options:
*   **A**: This matches perfectly. The cicada (the discerning person) became wise/cautious by observing the ""misfortunes of his neighbors"" (the other cicadas eaten by foxes).
*   **B**: The story does not involve divine judgment.
*   **C**: While trickery is present, the focus is on the cicada's wisdom and preparedness, not the breeding of more deception.
*   **D**: The cicada's caution actually *saves* him from his fate; it does not bring it about.
*   **E**: While true to an extent, it is a secondary observation compared to the cicada's primary motivation for his safety.

In Aesop's fables, this specific story (The Fox and the Cicada) is classically used to illustrate that a wise man learns from the misfortunes of others.

The Wolf, who lay lurking just by, heard this",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events:
1.  **The setup:** A mother goat warns her kid to be cautious and not open the door to anyone.
2.  **The deception:** A wolf (a hypocrite/imposter) tries to mimic the mother's voice to gain entry.
3.  **The discovery:** The kid looks out the window, compares the voice to the wolf's physical appearance, and realizes he is being deceived.
4.  **The result:** Because the kid looked closer, the wolf's ""cheat"" was discovered.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) A hypocrite can usually be found out:** This fits the narrative perfectly. The wolf is a hypocrite (pretending to be what he is not), and the kid ""finds him out"" by looking at his physical reality versus his feigned voice.
*   **B) Many pretend to be concerned...:** The story is about deception for predation, not specifically about wishing for demise under the guise of concern.
*   **C) Caring hearts can see through counterfeit desires:** While the kid sees through the counterfeit, ""caring hearts"" isn't the primary theme; ""caution"" and ""observation"" are.
*   **D) No cautious arguments...:** This is the moral for a different fable (The Eagle and the Owl or similar stories about cowardice).
*   **E) Neglecting careful oversight...:** The mother actually provided good oversight/instruction, and the kid followed it, so this doesn't fit the outcome of the story.

In the classic collections of Aesop's Fables (such as Croxall's), this specific fable (The Goat and the Kid) is explicitly paired with the moral that a hypocrite or a ""knave"" may disguise their speech, but their true nature is eventually revealed to those who are observant.

Apollo immediately explained to the snake, 'If you had simply killed the first person who ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A snake is constantly being stepped on because it is passive and allows people to walk over it without consequence.
2.  **The Action:** The snake seeks guidance or refuge from Apollo.
3.  **The Lesson:** Apollo tells the snake that its current predicament is a result of failing to set a precedent. If the snake had reacted with force/punishment the very first time it was wronged, others would have been deterred from repeating the act.
4.  **The Wider Application:** The fable illustrates the concept of **deterrence**. It suggests that allowing a small transgression to go unpunished invites further transgressions. By punishing the first offender, one establishes a reputation that prevents future harm.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** aligns perfectly with the concept of deterrence through swift punishment.
*   **B** focuses on the timing of punishment for the wicked, but the snake is the victim here, not the criminal.
*   **C** suggests immediate actions are shallow, which contradicts Apollo’s advice to act immediately.
*   **D** mentions ""cleverness,"" but the story specifically emphasizes the use of force/retaliation to create fear.
*   **E** focuses on the sanctuary, which is a secondary plot point to the actual dialogue/lesson.

The story teaches that swift punishment serves as a warning to others.

'I would agree,' the lion said, 'if you were not already in the habit of taking what",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions between the lion and the two other characters:

1.  **The Robber:** He demands the spoils based on a sense of entitlement and a history of taking things by force. The lion recognizes his greed and denies him, showing that those who are aggressive or demanding are often met with resistance.
2.  **The Wayfarer:** He is described as ""innocent"" and ""modest."" He does not demand anything; in fact, he retreats out of respect and caution. The lion is moved by this lack of entitlement and rewards the man’s modesty with generosity.

Comparing the options:
*   **A** directly addresses the contrast between the robber's forceful approach and the traveler's humble behavior, and how the lion responds differently to each.
*   **B** focuses on betrayal, which is not a primary theme here.
*   **C** suggests the man ""tamed"" the lion, but the lion was already portrayed as the moral arbiter who chose to be kind; the man didn't actively tame him.
*   **D** mentions cunning, but the wayfarer was sincere, not cunning.
*   **E** focuses on the robber's hypocrisy, which is a minor point compared to the contrast between the two men's rewards.

1.  **The Action:** A man is voluntarily spending all his money on expensive religious sacrifices/offerings at a hero shrine.
2.  **The Intervention:** The god/hero appears to him, not to reward him for his devotion, but to tell him to stop.
3.  **The Reasoning:** The god points out that if the man continues this lifestyle, he will inevitably become poor.
4.  **The Lesson:** The god warns that when the man becomes poor due to his own financial choices (the extravagance), he will likely shift the responsibility and blame the deity for his misfortune rather than his own lack of moderation.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses the theme of personal foolishness (spending too much) leading to misfortune and the tendency to blame external/divine forces for it.
*   **B** refers to promises, which are not mentioned in the text.
*   **C** talks about extravagance clouding counsel, but here the ""counsel"" (the god's warning) is actually trying to stop the extravagance.
*   **D** suggests a profit motive, whereas the man in the story seems motivated by misguided devotion or status.
*   **E** is a common religious moral, but it doesn't capture the specific warning about ""blame"" that constitutes the punchline of the fable.

The fable serves as a warning against self-inflicted ruin and the human tendency to scapegoat others (especially the gods) for the consequences of one's own actions.

When he saw the reflection of his body in the water, he disparaged the slenderness of his legs but revelled in the shape and",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Conflict of Values:** The stag evaluates his own body parts based on aesthetics. He views his thin legs as a defect (he ""disparaged"" them) and his large horns as a source of pride (he ""revelled"" in them).
2.  **The Turning Point:** When the hunters appear, the stag’s legs—the part he hated—perform the vital task of keeping him alive by outrunning the pursuers.
3.  **The Downfall:** The stag’s horns—the part he loved—become his downfall when they get tangled in the branches, leading to his capture.
4.  **The Realization:** The stag explicitly states the lesson at the end: the thing he thought was useless (his legs) was actually his salvation, while the thing he took pride in (his horns) caused his destruction.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) What is most truly valuable is often underrated:** This aligns perfectly with the stag's realization that his ""ugly"" legs were actually his most valuable asset.
*   **B) Greed for honor results in death:** While the horns were a source of honor/pride, the story isn't about ""greed""; it's about a failure to recognize functional value.
*   **C) Persistence outshines vanity:** Persistence is not a core theme here; the stag’s legs worked instantly, it wasn't a matter of endurance.
*   **D) Vain deceivers/falsehoods:** This relates more to stories about trickery (like ""The Fox and the Crow""), which does not happen here.
*   **E) Pride in appearances can blind us to our true strengths:** This is very close and a strong candidate. However, classic Aesopic morals for this specific fable (The Stag at the Spring) traditionally focus on the **underrating of what is useful** versus the overvaluing of what is ornamental. Option A is the most direct distillation of the stag's final lament.

In many classical translations of Aesop, the moral is explicitly stated as: ""We often despise what is most useful to us, and prize what is the most harmful."" Option A captures this best.

Furious at ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and character interactions:

1.  **The Conflict:** An Eagle (a strong predator) ignores the pleas of a Beetle (a small insect) and disrespects her while attacking a Hare. The Eagle assumes her strength makes her immune to any consequences from such a small creature.
2.  **The Revenge:** Despite being physically smaller and weaker, the Beetle is persistent. She uses her unique abilities (flying to high nests and buzzing around Jupiter) to destroy the Eagle's eggs repeatedly, proving that the Eagle's size cannot protect her lineage from the Beetle’s retribution.
3.  **The Resolution:** Even when the Eagle seeks the highest protection possible (Jupiter), the Beetle finds a way to succeed. Jupiter eventually acknowledges the ""justice of her cause,"" recognizing that the Eagle's initial arrogance and cruelty justified the Beetle's response.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) The weak may find a way to avenge a wrong:** This directly matches the theme. The Beetle is ""weak"" compared to the Eagle but successfully achieves vengeance.
*   **B) Greed and honor:** There is no theme of greed for honor leading to death in this story.
*   **C) Restraint:** While the Eagle lacked restraint, the core of the story is about the Beetle's successful retaliation.
*   **D) Beauty and leadership:** These themes are not present in the text.
*   **E) Compassion:** The story is actually a cycle of revenge and destruction, not a bridge of compassion between predator and prey.

1.  **The Accident:** The donkey accidentally falls into the water. Because salt dissolves, the load becomes lighter. The donkey learns that ""falling"" can lead to a reward (a lighter load).
2.  **The Deception:** The donkey decides to repeat the ""accident"" on purpose to avoid work. He successfully tricks the merchant once.
3.  **The Consequence:** The merchant recognizes the donkey's trickery. To teach the donkey a lesson and stop the deception, he replaces the salt with sponges. 
4.  **The Failure of Cunning:** When the donkey tries the same trick again, the sponges absorb the water and become much heavier. The donkey's attempt to be ""clever"" and deceitful backfires, resulting in a much harder task than if he had simply performed his duty.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) You can fool someone only so many times:** This fits the narrative perfectly. The donkey successfully fooled the merchant once, but the merchant caught on and turned the donkey's own trick against him.
*   **B)** This focuses on reputation, which is not the central theme here.
*   **C)** While the merchant's plan was ""cunning,"" this phrasing is awkward and doesn't capture the lesson learned by the donkey (the protagonist).
*   **D)** This is overly cynical and doesn't match the traditional Aesop-style moral regarding honesty and trickery.

1.  **The Context:** A blind man uses his sense of touch to identify animals. This implies he is perceptive of an animal's inherent nature or physical traits rather than being swayed by visual beauty.
2.  **The Subject:** He is presented with a wolf cub. Despite its youth and the ambiguity of its species (wolf vs. fox), the cub already possesses characteristics that set off an alarm.
3.  **The Conclusion:** The blind man identifies a core trait—an inherent danger or ""predatory nature""—that makes the creature unfit for a flock of sheep, regardless of its exact species or age.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable suggests that an individual's basic nature or ""evil"" tendencies are discernible even in their infancy or early stages of development. While it could be argued that ""appearances can be misleading,"" the blind man specifically identifies a future danger in a young creature, pointing to the idea that character traits are innate.

*   **A) Evil tendencies are shown in early life:** This directly mirrors the blind man's realization that the young cub already possesses the essence of a predator.
*   **B) Harsh means vs. kind means:** Not relevant to the plot.
*   **C) Appearances can be misleading:** While true, the story is specifically about the *early* signs of a negative nature, making A more precise.
*   **D) Rewarding vs. Punishing:** Not relevant to the plot.
*   **E) Familiarity:** The cub is not necessarily familiar to the man.

In Aesop's Fables, from which this story originates, the traditional moral is that nature is evident from the start.

morables_694,"There was a generous Rich Man who always had a grand and open table, so he never lacked guests. This man noticed that all sorts of people came to him, and he became curious to see who were true friend",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** A rich man is generous and provides food for many, attracting a large crowd. This establishes that popularity and company are easily bought with material goods.
2.  **The Test:** The rich man creates a scenario involving danger and conflict (a quarrel requiring ""swords in hand"") to see who will support him when there is an personal cost or risk involved, rather than a benefit.
3.  **The Result:** Out of a ""full table"" of guests, almost everyone makes excuses to avoid helping him. Only two individuals remain loyal.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The man identifies these two as his ""friends"" and the others as ""hangers-on.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) True friends are hard to come by:** This is a strong candidate, as it reflects the rarity of the two loyal people compared to the crowd.
*   **B) A man cannot be too careful...:** This is irrelevant to the story's themes of friendship and loyalty.
*   **C) Generosity should not enable freeloaders:** While the story illustrates that generosity *does* attract freeloaders, the focus of the rich man's experiment is the discovery of true loyalty, not a lecture on how to manage his wealth.
*   **D) Excuse-making people adjust their loyal beliefs based on what is profitable for them:** This describes the behavior of the guests, but it is more of an observation of the ""hangers-on"" rather than the overarching moral concerning the man's discovery.
*   **E) Generosity attracts company, but sincerity keeps it:** This captures the duality of the story. The rich man's wealth brought people to the table, but only sincere loyalty (friendship) stood the test of adversity. In many classical collections of fables (such as Aesop's or similar tradition), this specific story is used to illustrate that ""prosperity gains friends, but adversity tries them,"" or that true friendship is a rare thing found only when tested.

Between A and E, **A** is the most direct summary of the outcome: the man discovered that despite his many acquaintances, actual friends are very few.

morables_107,"A River carried down in its stream two Pots, one made of earthenware and the other of brass. The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, 'Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch m",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the interaction between the two pots:

1.  **The Characters:** One pot is made of brass (strong/tough) and the other is made of earthenware (clay/fragile).
2.  **The Conflict:** They are floating in a river together. The motion of the water makes collisions likely.
3.  **The Dialogue:** The Earthen Pot recognizes that if it collides with the Brass Pot, even slightly, the Earthen Pot will be destroyed, while the Brass Pot will remain unharmed. 
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that associations between the weak and the strong (or the poor and the rich) are often dangerous for the weaker party. Even if the stronger party means no harm, the inherent difference in their ""makeup"" or status leads to the destruction of the fragile one. 

**Analysis of options:**
- **A) Equals make the best friends:** This is the traditional moral associated with this Aesop's fable. It suggests that one should seek company among those of similar status or strength to avoid unintended harm.
- **B) Do no overestimate your worth...:** The Earthen Pot actually *understands* its worth and limitations perfectly; it is being cautious.
- **C) Both play vital roles:** The story doesn't focus on their utility, only on the danger of their proximity.
- **D) Cautious abstain...:** While the Earthen Pot is cautious, this phrase is generally associated with different contexts.
- **E) Each vessel carries worth:** This is a modern sentiment and contradicts the specific danger highlighted in the fable.

Because the core of the story is the danger of a ""fragile"" person associating with a ""hard"" person, the moral is that true partnership or safety is found among equals.

The wild boar replied, 'I have",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this fable (often attributed to Aesop), let’s look at the actions and motivations of the characters:

1.  **The Action:** The wild boar is sharpening his tusks even though there is no immediate threat or enemy in sight.
2.  **The Inquiry:** The fox questions the necessity of this work, implying it is a waste of effort during a time of peace or safety.
3.  **The Reasoning:** The boar explains that once danger arrives, it will be too late to prepare. He must be ready *before* the crisis occurs so he can act immediately.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace:** This aligns with the theme of ""forewarned is forearmed."" It suggests that being ready for trouble is the most effective way to handle (or prevent) it.
*   **B) God is the ultimate judge:** There is no religious or judicial theme in the story.
*   **C) Curiosity must be guided by prudence:** This would apply if the fox got into trouble for asking, but the focus is on the boar’s preparation.
*   **D) Prudent men feel worst when they contribute to their own inquisitive undoing:** This does not fit the narrative arc.
*   **E) Even nature prepares its own defenses:** While true in a literal sense, fables use animals to teach human behavior. Option A is the traditional proverbial lesson derived from this specific fable.

The story teaches that we should prepare for danger before it arrives. In classical literature, this fable is the source of the moral ""In time of peace, prepare for war.""

When the depositor then summoned him to swear an oath regarding the deposit, he realized the danger he was in and prepar",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the dialogue between the characters:

1.  **The Premise:** A man intends to steal a deposit from a friend and plans to swear a false oath to get away with it.
2.  **The Encounter:** He meets the god ""Oath,"" who tells him that he usually revisits cities to punish the wicked every thirty or forty years.
3.  **The False Security:** Relying on this timeline, the man believes he has decades before he will face divine retribution. This emboldens him to commit perjury immediately.
4.  **The Twist:** The god returns the very next day to punish him. When the man protests, citing the ""thirty-year"" rule, the god explains that for those who intentionally provoke him (by knowingly lying), he can return instantly.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This matches the core lesson. The man thought punishment was on a fixed, predictable schedule (30-40 years), but the god reveals that divine justice is unpredictable and can happen at any time, especially when provoked.
*   **B:** There is no comparison between a single man and a crowd in this story.
*   **C:** While the man was misled, the story is specifically about the timing of punishment for wickedness, not a general commentary on fear and truth.
*   **D:** This refers to inciting strife, which isn't the primary theme of theft and perjury found here.
*   **E:** While technically true in a general sense, the story emphasizes the *timing and inevitability of punishment* rather than the psychological weight of a ""conscience.""

The fable (attributed to Aesop, often titled ""The Man and the God Oath"") is specifically intended to warn that one should not assume justice is slow or scheduled; it can strike at any moment.

1.  **The First Event:** The farmer asks his neighbors for help. The mother Lark is not worried because she knows that relying on others for a task often leads to delays. If a person isn't doing the work themselves, they aren't truly ready to start.
2.  **The Second Event:** The farmer realizes the neighbors aren't coming and the crop is overripe. He decides to take action himself by hiring laborers and overseeing the work personally. 
3.  **The Lesson:** The mother Lark recognizes that the harvest will finally happen because the farmer is now taking personal responsibility for the task rather than waiting on the favors of friends.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Self-help is the best help:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The work only gets done when the person responsible for it decides to do it themselves.
*   **B) Cunning often outwits itself:** Unrelated; there is no ""cunning"" or trickery involved.
*   **C) Wisdom grows with determination:** While the farmer is determined, the core of the story is about the reliability of self-reliance vs. relying on others.
*   **D) The Golden Rule:** Unrelated to the plot.
*   **E) Poetic imagery:** This describes the setting but is not a moral lesson.

The story teaches that if you want a job done, you must do it yourself rather than waiting on others. This is the definition of ""self-help.""

As soon as he realized what was going on, Aesop -- who w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this story, let's analyze the symbolism and the dialogue step by step:

1.  **The Context:** Aesop is playing children's games (marbles). An onlooker mocks him, assuming that a wise man engaging in play must be ""crazy"" or losing his mind.
2.  **The Action:** Aesop uses an unstrung bow as a metaphor.
3.  **The Explanation:** Aesop explains that a bow kept under constant tension (""tightly strung at all times"") will lose its elasticity or break. To remain functional for its purpose, it must be allowed to go slack and ""rest.""
4.  **The Application:** The ""bow"" is a metaphor for the human mind or spirit. Just as a bow needs periods of no tension to remain effective for hunting, a human needs periods of play and relaxation to remain effective for serious intellectual or wise pursuits.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Resting the mind is essential for clear thinking:** This directly aligns with Aesop's explanation that the ""bow"" (the mind) needs rest to be ""ready to use whenever you need it.""
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for:** This is irrelevant to the story.
*   **C) Mockery often masks confusion:** While the man was confused, the core lesson Aesop provides is about the necessity of his play, not the nature of the man's mockery.
*   **D) Be prepared to defend your witty, playful position:** This describes what Aesop did, but it is not the *lesson* of the bow metaphor.
*   **E) Wisdom often hides behind playful appearances:** This is a theme in the story, but the specific explanation of the bow focuses on the *utility* of rest rather than the *disguise* of wisdom.

As Aesop explains, the purpose of his ""crazy"" play is to ensure his mind does not ""break"" from constant tension. Therefore, the moral is that relaxation and play are necessary to maintain one's mental faculties.

1.  **The Sow:** She boasts about the **quantity** of her offspring (a ""whole litter""), using her numbers to mock or challenge the lioness.
2.  **The Lioness:** She acknowledges she only has **one** offspring, but emphasizes that he is a lion—representing a superior status or **quality**.

The contrast being drawn is between having many unremarkable things versus having one exceptional thing. The lioness's retort implies that the value of one high-quality child far outweighs a large number of lower-quality children.

*   **B), C), D), and E):** While these may contain general wisdom, they do not specifically address the primary conflict of the story (numbers vs. nature).

1.  **The Appearance of Opportunity:** The figure is described as running swiftly and balancing on a razor's edge, indicating that opportunities are fleeting and precarious.
2.  **The Hair:** He is bald except for a ""lock of hair on his forehead."" This implies that there is only one way to grab him—from the front, as he approaches you.
3.  **The Back of the Head:** Because he is bald in the back, once he has passed you, there is nothing to grab onto. Even the most powerful force (Jupiter) cannot retrieve him once he is gone.
4.  **The Definition:** The text explicitly states he is a symbol of ""the brief moment in which things are possible.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Seize opportunities when they arise:** This aligns perfectly with the imagery. Since you can only catch him from the front and he cannot be caught once he passes, the lesson is to act immediately.
*   **B) Be content with your lot:** The story is about action and timing, not contentment.
*   **C) Power without purpose is ineffectual:** While Jupiter is mentioned, the focus is on the nature of time and opportunity, not the misuse of power.
*   **D) Boast of one powerful thing...:** This is the moral of a different fable (The Fox and the Cat), not relevant here.
*   **E) Every daring act teeters on...:** While ""razor's edge"" is mentioned, the primary focus is not on bravery vs. vulnerability, but on the irreversibility of missed timing.

The story warns that opportunity is fleeting and must be grabbed head-on before it passes forever.

He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this story, let's analyze the characters and their actions step by step:

1.  **The Fox's Behavior:** The fox is clearly aware of the danger. She is ""pondering every possible approach,"" implying she knows there is a trap. Despite this, she uses flowery language and claims of ""friendship"" to encourage the wolf to walk into the trap. This is a classic example of deception and false flattery used to sacrifice another for one's own gain (or simply to test the danger).
2.  **The Wolf's Mistake:** The wolf falls for the ""gift"" and the fox's claim of friendship. He trusts the fox's words rather than assessing the situation himself.
3.  **The Outcome:** The wolf is injured, and he realizes that the ""gift"" was a malicious trick.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that people who use excessive flattery and offer ""free"" gifts without cause often have ulterior, harmful motives. 

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Flatterers and deceivers are not to be trusted:** This directly aligns with the fox's behavior (flattery and deception) and the wolf's realization.
*   **B) Know yourself and your limits:** This doesn't apply well here.
*   **C) Trust can be a double-edged sword:** While true, it is too vague compared to the specific warning against deceivers.
*   **D) A single reliable skill...:** This is the moral of a different fable (The Cat and the Fox).
*   **E) Caution is wise...:** This suggests a positive outcome for collaboration, which did not happen here.

The story serves as a warning against trusting those who use sweet words to lure others into danger.

1.  **The Promise:** One beetle promises the other that if he finds food on the mainland, he will bring some back for his friend. This promise is made easily when the future is uncertain but the intention seems helpful.
2.  **The Reality:** The beetle finds an abundance of food (moist, fresh manure). He eats his fill and grows fat, enjoying the success of his journey.
3.  **The Outcome:** When the beetle returns, he has brought nothing back. He blames the nature of the environment (""the food cannot be taken away"") rather than his failure to fulfill the promise.
4.  **The Lesson:** The ""fat"" beetle enjoyed the benefits of the new location but did not honor the commitment he made to his friend. The story illustrates that people often make grand promises when they are in need or embarking on a journey, but fail to deliver once they have found personal success or when the situation becomes inconvenient.

1.  **The Situation:** Two frogs are looking for a home because their current pond has dried up. They encounter a well.
2.  **The Conflict:** The first frog focuses only on the immediate benefit (plenty of water) and wants to jump in right away.
3.  **The Reasoning:** The second frog considers the long-term consequences. If the well dries up just like their pond did, they will be trapped at the bottom because the walls of a well are too high to climb out of.
4.  **The Lesson:** The second frog teaches us that we should consider the potential risks and outcomes of an action before we commit to it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Look before you leap:** This is a literal and figurative match. The frogs are literally about to leap into a hole, and the advice is to survey the situation and consider the consequences first.
*   **B) Watch the actions of your enemy:** There are no enemies in this story.
*   **C) Haste often leads to regret:** While relevant, this is a secondary theme. The core of the story is the specific foresight regarding the ""exit strategy.""
*   **D) Impulsive, vicious people...:** This is irrelevant as the frogs are not being vicious or trying to hurt others.
*   **E) Adaptability is key...:** The frogs are trying to adapt, but the story focuses specifically on the danger of a specific choice (the well).

He saluted the gods who came to congratulate him one after another, but when he was approached by Plutus, the god of wealth and th",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Premise:** Hercules is received into heaven due to his ""excellent qualities"" (his virtue and heroic deeds). This establishes Hercules as the representative of virtue and merit.
2.  **The Conflict:** Hercules greets all the gods except Plutus, the god of wealth.
3.  **The Reason:** When questioned by Jupiter, Hercules explains his disdain: he hates Plutus because wealth is often a ""friend to the wicked"" and ""corrupts the entire world."" 
4.  **The Lesson:** The story contrasts Hercules (won his place through merit/virtue) with Plutus (represents money/corruption). By shunning wealth, Hercules asserts that money is an enemy to integrity and is frequently given to those who do not deserve it.

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   (A) **""Coffers of cash put a stop to honest traffic in praise""**: This is a classic translation of the moral of this Aesop fable (often titled ""Hercules and Plutus""). It suggests that wealth interferes with the honest recognition of true merit/virtue.
*   (B) Focuses on the ""threat"" to the wealthy, which isn't the focus of Hercules' complaint.
*   (C) While true to the story's sentiment, it doesn't fully capture Hercules' specific critique of how wealth corrupts others.
*   (D) The story doesn't mention thieves being caught.
*   (E) This describes why Hercules is in heaven, but not the specific lesson of the interaction with Plutus.

The fable specifically targets the idea that wealth is distributed regardless of merit and often serves to corrupt, thereby hindering the honest recognition of virtue.

The dog summoned the wolf as his witness",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the conclusion:

1.  **The Conflict:** A dog makes a false accusation against an innocent sheep to steal from her.
2.  **The Deception:** The wolf provides false testimony (perjury) to ensure the sheep is wrongfully convicted and punished.
3.  **The Outcome:** The sheep suffers an injustice and is forced to pay a debt she does not owe.
4.  **The Resolution:** Shortly after, the wolf (the liar) meets a gruesome end in a ditch.
5.  **The Lesson:** The sheep observes the wolf's death and explicitly identifies it as a divine punishment for his lies (""the reward that gods give to liars"").

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) Wicked liars generally get their just consequences:** This aligns perfectly with the sheep's concluding statement and the wolf's fate. It reflects the concept of ""poetic justice.""
*   **B) Harsh means for reasoning:** The story is about injustice and lies, not about teaching someone a lesson through discipline.
*   **C) Deception masks innocence:** While the sheep was innocent, the focus of the ending is on the fate of the deceiver, not the nature of innocence itself.
*   **D) One insult invites another:** The story depicts a finished cycle of a lie followed by retribution, not a cycle of escalating insults.
*   **E) Fabric of trust:** While true in a general sense, the fable concludes specifically with the punishment of the liar rather than a commentary on societal trust.

The story serves as a warning that while lying might bring a short-term gain (the sheep's bread), it ultimately leads to a bad end for the liar.

1.  **The Context:** A Lark is trapped in a snare and faces immediate danger from a Fowler (the person who catches birds).
2.  **The Plea:** The Lark attempts to defend herself by arguing that her ""crime"" is negligible. She points out she hasn't stolen anything valuable like gold or silver, but only a single grain of corn to survive. She is using logic and morality to appeal for her life.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Fowler does not listen, does not provide a counter-argument, and does not show mercy. He simply kills her because his goal is to catch birds, regardless of the bird's ""innocence"" or reasons.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that when the person you are pleading with (your adversary) is also the one who has total power over the outcome (your judge), your arguments—no matter how logical or sincere—will likely fall on deaf ears. The Fowler has a fixed intent, and the Lark’s perspective on justice is irrelevant to him.

Looking at the options:
- **A** directly addresses the futility of the Lark's plea given the power dynamic.
- **B** reflects a different fable (like ""The Dog and the Shadow"").
- **C** is negated by the text (the Fowler is silent and unmerciful).
- **D** is nonsensical in this context.
- **E** is the opposite of what happens; sincerity proves powerless here.

Therefore, the moral is that logic and pleas for justice are useless when the person you are trying to convince is your enemy and holds all the power.

morables_82,"Be quiet now, said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap. If you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf. Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the intent of the characters:

1.  **The Situation:** A nurse tells a child that if they continue to make noise, she will throw them to the wolf. This is a threat she has no intention of following through on; it is a colloquialism or a ""white lie"" used to frighten the child into silence.
2.  **The Misunderstanding:** A wolf overhears this and takes the promise literally. He waits patiently for the ""food"" he believes he has been promised.
3.  **The Resolution:** When the child cries and the wolf reveals himself to collect his ""morsel,"" the nurse does the opposite of what she said—she shuts the window and calls for protection (the dogs), which chase the wolf away.
4.  **The Lesson:** The wolf learned the hard way that the words of an enemy (or person of an opposing interest) are not reliable. The promise made by the nurse was empty.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Enemies' promises were made to be broken:** This fits perfectly. The wolf treated the nurse's threat as a promise of a meal. In fables (specifically Aesop's ""The Nurse and the Wolf""), this story illustrates that one should not trust the words of those who are naturally opposed to them. 
*   **B, C, D, E:** These do not match the central irony of the wolf's misplaced trust in the nurse's words.

Then the fly laughed at the man and said, 'You wanted to avenge the sting of a ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the dialogue and actions of the characters:

1.  **The Event:** A man accidentally hurts himself while trying to kill a fly that bit him.
2.  **The Fly's Mockery:** The fly mocks the man for his overreaction and for harming himself in his attempt to seek revenge.
3.  **The Man's Defense:** The man distinguishes between his accidental self-harm (""I did not try to hurt myself on purpose"") and the fly's malicious intent (""delight in drinking human blood""). He concludes that intentional malice deserves a much harsher penalty than an accidental error, even if the error was physically painful.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Intent matters more than the outcome:** This matches the man's core argument. He forgives himself for the ""serious slap"" because his **intent** was not to hurt himself, whereas he condemns the fly because its **intent** was to bite and drink blood.
*   **B) Sharing/Rudeness:** This is irrelevant to the plot of the story.
*   **C) Forgiveness outshines mockery:** While the man forgives himself, the story is more focused on the justification of his actions against the fly than a general lesson on the beauty of forgiveness.
*   **D) Frustrated self-effort:** This is overly wordy and doesn't capture the conflict between the man and the fly.
*   **E) In anger, we may cause ourselves more harm:** This is a common interpretation of some versions of this fable (Phaedrus/Aesop), but in this specific text, the man **rejects** this logic. He explicitly states he is willing to suffer even ""greater inconvenience"" to stop the fly, prioritizing the elimination of the threat over his own physical comfort. Thus, the text prioritizes the **intent** behind the slap over the physical **harm** caused.

The man's rebuttal centers entirely on the difference between an accidental injury (himself) and a purposeful attack (the fly).

morables_60,"A quarrel had arisen between the Horse and the Stag, so the Horse came to a Hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the Stag. The Hunter agreed, but said: 'If you desire to conquer the Stag, you mus",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the correct moral of the fable ""The Horse, the Hunter, and the Stag,"" let's break down the narrative:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Horse seeks revenge on the Stag but cannot defeat him alone.
2.  **The Deal:** The Horse asks a Human for help. The Human agrees, but only if the Horse accepts limitations (the bit, bridle, and saddle).
3.  **The Result:** The goal is achieved (the Stag is defeated), but the Horse finds himself permanently enslaved. The Hunter refuses to release him because he now has the tools to control the Horse.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** While the Hunter does use the Horse for his own purposes, this option misses the primary warning about the high cost of seeking revenge through a more powerful intermediary.
*   **B:** This is a classic interpretation of the fable. The ""injury"" refers to the original quarrel with the Stag. The fable teaches that it is better to suffer a minor slight (the Stag's offense) without retaliation than to sacrifice your total liberty (putting yourself in the power of the Hunter) to get even.
*   **C:** This focuses on the Hunter's cunning, but the story is a cautionary tale for the Horse, not a celebration of the Hunter's strategy.
*   **D:** While vengeance is a theme, the primary outcome is about loss of freedom, not just the fleeting nature of pleasure.
*   **E:** This is close, but ""guidance"" is too mild a term for the permanent servitude and physical control represented by the bit and spur.

Option B captures the essence of the trade-off: the Horse traded his entire existence for a momentary victory, proving that seeking a powerful protector to settle a grudge often results in a worse fate than the original problem.

You have such ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Cat's Intentions:** The cat wants the eel but doesn't want to get wet. He tries to trick the stork into opening her mouth by using flattery (""O most beautiful bird!"") and then by using insults (calling her ""filthy"" and ""wretched"") when flattery fails.
2.  **The Stork's Reaction:** The stork recognizes the trap. She knows that if she responds to the cat—whether to accept the compliment or defend her honor against the insults—she will drop her prize (the eel).
3.  **The Outcome:** The stork ignores the cat’s attempts to distract or provoke her and continues on her way with her meal intact.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A) Stay focused on your goals:** This fits the stork's behavior perfectly. She did not let flattery or anger distract her from keeping her meal.
- **B, C, D, E:** While E (flattery masks intentions) is a common theme in fables like ""The Fox and the Crow,"" this specific story adds a second layer: when flattery fails, the cat turns to insults. The primary lesson is found in the **stork's success**, which came from her refusal to be provoked or distracted, staying focused on her goal.

In many classic collections (such as those by Aesop or similar fabulists), this specific story highlights the virtue of not being deterred by outside noise.

'At the moment I am thi",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the actions of the characters and the outcome:

1.  **The Opportunity:** The wolf had a clear chance to eat the dog when the dog was vulnerable on the ground.
2.  **The Deception:** The dog used a persuasive promise (getting ""fattened up"" at a wedding) to convince the wolf to delay his meal.
3.  **The Result:** Because the wolf waited for a ""better"" future opportunity rather than taking what was immediately available, he lost everything. The dog moved to a safe location (the roof) and explicitly told the wolf that the previous deal would never happen again.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) Take what you can get when you can get it:** This fits the wolf's failure perfectly. He had a meal and let it go based on a promise of more. This is a classic Aesopic theme: ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.""
*   **B) Liberty:** The story isn't about freedom vs. slavery; it's about survival and trickery.
*   **C) The cunning prey on the gullible:** While true, the dog (the prey) is the one preying on the wolf's greed/gullibility. However, the lesson is more specifically about the wolf's mistake in passing up a sure thing.
*   **D) Cunning enemies' persuasive promises...:** This is overly complex and mislabels the ""predatory nature."" The dog's promise was broken by his survival instinct, not a predatory one.
*   **E) Delaying the inevitable:** This suggests the dog will eventually be caught, but the ending implies the dog has learned how to stay safe permanently (""don't wait for a wedding"").

The most traditional and accurate moral for this specific fable (often titled ""The Dog and the Wolf"") is that one should not sacrifice a certain gain for the sake of a larger, uncertain promise in the future.

morables_222,"A gnat happened to land on the back of a camel and lingered there on top of the baggage. When he finally decided to disembark, he said, 'I will let myself down now as fast as I can so as not to burden",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the behavior of the characters:

1.  **The Gnat's Perspective:** The gnat believes his presence is a significant burden to the camel. He feels he is so important and substantial that his departure will provide the camel with a sense of relief.
2.  **The Camel's Perspective:** The camel is entirely indifferent. He didn't even notice the gnat arriving or staying. To the camel, the gnat is so minuscule that his presence or absence has zero impact on the reality of the camel's load.
3.  **The Conflict:** The gnat has an inflated sense of self-importance (ego), while the camel provides a reality check by showing how insignificant the gnat actually is in the grander scheme.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The gnat thinks he is of great ""consequence"" (importance), but to his ""neighbor"" (the camel), he is irrelevant.
*   **B:** While the gnat is arrogant, ""influence"" isn't the primary focus—self-perception is.
*   **C & D:** These focus on ""patience,"" which is not the central theme; the camel isn't being patient, he's simply unbothered because the gnat is weightless.
*   **E:** While true, it is a literal observation rather than the ""moral"" or lesson regarding human behavior (which fables typically target).

The fable satirizes people who overestimate their own importance or the impact they have on others.

The fox turned to the women and said, 'What shouts there would be aga",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the conflict and the dialogue:

1.  **The Context:** A fox observes humans eating their own property (chickens they raised or bought).
2.  **The Fox's Complaint:** The fox points out what he perceives as a double standard: if he were to eat the chickens, he would be hunted and shouted at, yet the women eat them in peace.
3.  **The Rebuttal:** An old woman clarifies the distinction. The women are consuming what is rightfully theirs (**ownership**), whereas the fox is a thief who takes what belongs to others (**theft/trespass**).
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that actions permitted to an owner within their own domain are not necessarily permitted to outsiders or strangers. One cannot use the behavior of an owner as a justification for their own interference with that owner's property.

Analyzing the options:
*   **A)** This directly addresses the distinction between an owner's right to their property and an outsider's lack of right to that same property.
*   **B)** There is no friendship or betrayal in the story.
*   **C)** The silence of the women is a detail, but the lesson is about property rights, not outsmarting through silence.
*   **D)** This is a different moral entirely, focusing on body language and malice.
*   **E)** This is a descriptive observation of the scene, not a moral lesson.

The core of the fable is about the difference between rightful possession and theft. Therefore, Option A is the correct moral.

morables_245,"A viper entered a blacksmith's workshop and bit the file, testing it to see if this was something she could eat. The file protested fiercely, 'You fool! Why are you trying to wound me with your teeth,",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the characters:

1.  **The Action:** A viper (a creature with organic teeth/venom) attempts to bite a file (a tool made of hardened steel designed for grinding).
2.  **The Conflict:** The viper is trying to harm or consume something that is inherently harder and more durable than itself.
3.  **The Response:** The file points out the absurdity of the attack. Since the file's nature is to ""gnaw through every sort of iron,"" the viper’s puny teeth have no effect. In fact, attempting to bite the file only risks harming the viper's own teeth.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates the futility of trying to hurt someone (or something) that is much stronger, more resilient, or impervious to your specific mode of attack.

Looking at the options:
- **A) It is useless attacking the insensible:** In many translations of Aesop, ""insensible"" refers to those who are unfeeling, hard-hearted, or physically impervious. Attacking a steel file is the definition of a useless attack on something that cannot be wounded.
- **B)** Relates to cooperation, which is not present here.
- **C)** While the viper is curious, the core of the story is about the futility of its aggression.
- **D)** The story is about the act of the attack itself, not the forgiveness of it.
- **E)** The file only speaks after it is attacked; it didn't boast to invite the challenge.

Option A is the classical moral associated with this fable (often phrased as ""It is useless to attack those who can wound you more than you can wound them"" or ""attacking those who are impervious"").

morables_75,"A Man and a Lion traveled together through the forest. They soon began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and prowess. As they were disputing, they passed a statue carv",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the Man and the Lion:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Man and the Lion are arguing about who is superior.
2.  **The Evidence:** The Man points to a statue as ""proof"" of human superiority because it shows a human defeating a lion.
3.  **The Counter-Argument:** The Lion points out a fundamental flaw in the evidence: the statue was created by a human. If a lion had been the sculptor, the scene depicted would be the exact opposite.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that ""truth"" or ""superiority"" often depends on the perspective of the person telling the story or creating the evidence. Every story has two sides, and the person in power (the one who makes the ""statue"") controls the narrative.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) One story is good, till another is told:** This aligns perfectly with the idea that the Man's ""proof"" only seemed valid until the Lion provided the missing context/perspective. It suggests that a single perspective is never the whole truth.
*   **B, C, D, and E:** While these deal with pride or bravery, they do not address the Lion's specific point about the **origin and bias of the narrative**, which is the central theme of this fable.

The fable teaches us that evidence presented by one side of an argument is biased toward that side’s interests.

On his way to the assembly of the birds, the peaco",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character's motivations:

1.  **The Character's Motivation:** The peacock is described as beautiful and gentle. However, he agrees to give away his feathers specifically in exchange for the raven ""squawking his praises"" in front of other birds. This indicates a desire for public recognition and validation of his beauty (vanity).
2.  **The Action:** The peacock continues to give away the very things that define him and protect him (his feathers) to various birds in exchange for this praise.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he prioritized the vanity of being praised over his physical needs and responsibilities (protecting his chicks and surviving the winter), he ended up ""plucked completely bare.""
4.  **The Outcome:** He was unable to fulfill his duties, could not survive the cold, and ultimately died.

Analysis of choices:
*   **A) Vanity can lead to self-destruction:** This fits perfectly. The peacock's need for praise led him to give away his means of survival.
*   **B) Do not boast...:** The peacock actually had the feathers, so he wasn't lying about what he possessed.
*   **C) Opportunism...:** While the other birds were opportunistic, the primary lesson focuses on the protagonist's downfall due to his own choices.
*   **D) Sorrow not...:** This does not apply to the peacock's behavior or the tragic ending.
*   **E) True beauty shines...:** The story ends in death and failure, suggesting that his ""kindness"" (which was actually a transaction for praise) did not save him.

The peacock sacrificed his survival for the sake of his ego and the desire to be admired by others.

You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth as a w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot:

1.  **The Conflict:** A tiny Gnat challenges a mighty Lion, mocking the Lion's strength as being no better than a ""woman in her quarrels.""
2.  **The Victory:** The Gnat cleverly uses its small size to sting the Lion where he is vulnerable. The Lion ends up defeating himself by clawing his own face in frustration.
3.  **The Pride:** Following his victory, the Gnat is overcome with pride, buzzing ""a song of triumph"" and boasting about his superiority over the ""hugest beasts.""
4.  **The Downfall:** While celebratory and distracted by his own greatness, the Gnat flies into a common spider's web and is eaten by an ""inconsiderable"" insect.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A:** This captures the essence of the Gnat's journey. He bragged about defeating a King of Beasts, only to be undone by a simple spider's web. It highlights that no success is permanent if one becomes careless through boasting.
- **B:** This refers to a completely different fable (The Eagle and the Fox or similar). There was no ""supplicating"" enemy here.
- **C:** While pride is involved, ""frustration"" doesn't quite capture the Gnat being eaten; ""destruction"" or ""ruin"" would be more accurate.
- **D:** This is circular and focuses more on the fight with the Lion than the ending with the spider.
- **E:** While true for the Gnat vs. Lion part, it ignores the ending where the Gnat dies.

The classic moral of Aesop’s ""The Gnat and the Lion"" is that the pride of a great victory often leads to a person's downfall by a minor cause. Option A most closely aligns with the narrative arc where the Gnat's boasting is followed immediately by his undoing.

1.  **Examine the plot:** The story describes fishermen who use their skills and effort (""struggled for a long time"") but fail to catch anything. As they give up, a fish literally jumps into their boat, not because of their fishing techniques, but because it was fleeing a predator.
2.  **Identify the conflict and resolution:** The conflict is the lack of success despite hard work. The resolution is an unexpected success achieved through a fluke event (the tuna jumping in the boat).
3.  **Evaluate the options:**
    *   **A) Luck often bestows the things that skill cannot obtain.** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between the fishermen’s failed labor (skill) and the accidental catch (luck).
    *   **B) Small is safe/big is dangerous.** This doesn't apply here; the tuna was chased, but the focus of the story is the fishermen's gain.
    *   **C) Joy can outpace despair.** While true in a literal sense for the characters, it's not a logical ""moral"" regarding human conduct or the nature of life.
    *   **D) Rejoicing equals make the best pursuing friends.** This is nonsensical/grammatically confusing in this context.
    *   **E) Perseverance becomes its own reward.** The story actually contradicts this; their perseverance yielded nothing. It was only when they stopped that they got the fish by chance.

4.  **Conclusion:** The fable is a classic illustration of how fortune (luck) can provide what effort and skill sometimes cannot.

Not withstanding all his prayers, instead of becoming richer, he got poorer. Out ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Setup:** A man prays to a wooden idol for wealth, but despite his devotion, his situation worsens. This shows that passive worship and traditional piety are not yielding results.
2.  **The Climax:** In a fit of anger and impatience, the man destroys the very object he once revered. He abandons his ""faith"" in favor of an act of violence/desperation.
3.  **The Result:** The destruction of the idol reveals a hidden physical treasure (gold pieces) that the ""god"" would not provide through prayer.
4.  **The Conclusion/Observation:** The man changes his perspective on the deity immediately. He realizes that the ""god"" responded to force rather than prayer. 

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **B, C, and D** contain language that doesn't quite fit the outcome (the outcome was actually positive for the man, and he wasn't ""graceless"" in his success). 
*   **E** is a possible interpretation (Fortune favors the bold), but the story specifically contrasts **prayer** with **force** and shows a man radically shifting his attitude toward a deity based on whether it provided him with a profit.
*   **A** captures the cynical core of the fable: The man's ""worship"" was conditional. Once the idol failed to be profitable, he smashed it; once he got the money, he insulted the deity he used to pray to. This is a classic Aesop-style commentary on how human devotion and belief systems are often tied to personal gain. If a belief doesn't pay off, it is discarded or changed for one that does.

The fable highlights that the man's reverence was only skin-deep and that human nature tends to value results over the ideology itself.

Then the little gnat said to the bull, 'It's enough for me that you have accepted my ch",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Interaction:** A tiny gnat challenges a mighty bull to a contest of strength. Despite the massive disparity in power, the bull accepts the challenge.
2.  **The Gnat's Strategy:** The gnat immediately claims victory not by fighting, but by the mere fact that the bull acknowledged him as a worthy adversary. By accepting the duel, the bull effectively elevated the gnat to his own level.
3.  **The Outcome:** The gnat boasts to the crowd, and the bull is left looking foolish or frustrated.
4.  **The Author's Commentary:** The text explicitly states that if the bull had been mindful of his own ""mighty bulk"" (his status and power), he would have ignored the gnat as being beneath him. By ignoring the gnat, he would have denied the gnat the chance to boast.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **B** and **D** are irrelevant to the themes of the story.
*   **C** and **E** focus on pride leading to one's own downfall or futility, but the story is more specifically about the status lost when an elite entity acknowledges an insignificant challenger.
*   **A** captures the essence of the final sentences: by engaging with an ""unworthy opponent,"" the bull lowered his reputation and gave the gnat a status (equality) it did not deserve.

The lesson is that ignoring an insignificant provocation is often more dignified than engaging with it, as engagement implies the challenger is worth your time.

2.  **The Dog's Rebuttal**: The dog identifies that although the owner did not physically strike him, the owner **ordered** others to do so. The dog correctly identifies that the source of the punishment is the owner's will, regardless of whose hand held the whip.
3.  **The Core Lesson**: The fable addresses human responsibility and agency. It argues that delegating a cruel or negative task to someone else does not absolve the person who commanded it of the guilt.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) What a person does through another is truly their own action.** This directly matches the dog's logic that an order is equivalent to the act itself.
*   **B) There is danger lurking in the words of a wicked person.** While the owner is hypocritical, the story focus is on actions/delegation rather than ""wicked words.""
*   **C) Kindness is often unappreciated.** The story refutes the owner's claim of kindness, so this is incorrect.
*   **D) Better to face a known danger...** This is a moral for a different type of fable (like those involving predators and prey).
*   **E) Distinctive traits can lead to unexpected reunions.** This describes a plot point (the bob-tail leading to the dog's return), but it is not the ""moral"" or the philosophical lesson of the heart of the story.

The dog's final line, ""When I am beaten by your order, I consider it as if you yourself are beating me,"" is a perfect illustration of the principle that one is responsible for what they authorize others to do.

Even when they saw one of",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A flock of sheep observes a butcher entering their midst and taking individuals away one by one to be slaughtered.
2.  **The Reaction:** Instead of uniting to defend one another, the sheep remain passive. They comfort themselves with the thought that as long as they personally aren't the ones being taken (""He keeps his hands off me""), they are safe and have no reason to act.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because they failed to act collectively when they had the numbers and the strength, the butcher is able to eliminate the entire flock until only one sheep remains.
4.  **The Realization:** The final sheep recognizes that their downfall was their failure to stand together and resist the butcher at the very beginning.

This narrative is a classic illustration of how indifference to the plight of others eventually leads to one's own destruction. It emphasizes that collective security depends on mutual defense. If you remain silent while others are taken, you diminish your own chances of survival until you are left alone with no one to help you.

*   **Option A** directly reflects this lesson: ""If you don't speak out for others, there will be nobody left to speak out for you."" (This is thematic of the famous ""First they came..."" poem by Martin Niemöller).
*   Option B refers to ""The Frogs Desiring a King.""
*   Option C is too broad; the story is specifically about collective action and apathy.
*   Option D and E do not align with the narrative of the sheep's failure to resist a common enemy.

morables_131,"There was a hooligan who struck Aesop with a stone. Aesop said, 'Well done!' and he even gave the boy a coin. Then he added, 'Confound it, that's all the cash I've got, but I'll show you more where th",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the consequences for the characters:

1.  **The Action:** A hooligan commits a reckless act (striking Aesop with a stone).
2.  **The False Success:** Instead of punishing him immediately, Aesop rewards him with a coin. This positive reinforcement leads the hooligan to believe that his bad behavior is a viable path to wealth.
3.  **The Escalation:** Encouraged by his initial ""success,"" the hooligan attempts to repeat the action on someone more powerful, expecting an even greater reward.
4.  **The Outcome:** The hooligan’s previous success blinded him to the danger of his actions, leading him to a situation where he was arrested and executed.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Success leads many astray to their ruin:** This fits perfectly. The ""success"" (the coin from Aesop) misled the hooligan into thinking he could continue his reckless behavior safely, which ultimately caused his death.
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for:** The hooligan didn't exactly ""wish"" for something that had unintended consequences; he was actively manipulated.
*   **C) Clever minds outwit reckless wealth:** Aesop is clever, but the target wasn't ""reckless wealth""; the target was the hooligan.
*   **D) Avoid reckless overindulgence in manipulative pursuits:** This is too wordy and doesn't quite capture the ""false success"" element.
*   **E) Responding with grace can disarm hostility:** Aesop didn't respond with grace to disarm hostility; he responded with calculated trickery to ensure the hooligan was punished by a higher authority.

The core lesson is that initial success in a bad endeavor often emboldens a person to continue until they meet their downfall.

1.  **Winter's Argument:** Winter prides itself on its power and authoritarian nature. It compares itself to a ""dictator or a despot,"" noting that it forces people to tremble, look at the ground, and stay indoors. Winter views its ability to control and frighten people as a sign of superiority.
2.  **Spring's Rebuttal:** Spring points out that because Winter rules through fear and restriction, people are ""glad to get rid of"" it. In contrast, Spring is characterized by the freedom and joy it brings. People seek out Spring, find pleasure in its name, and miss it when it is gone.
3.  **The Lesson:** The contrast highlights that while one may exert control through force (fear), such a leader is loathed. True influence and greatness come from the joy and freedom one provides to others, which results in being genuinely cherished. This directly mirrors the classic philosophical debate between being loved versus being feared.

The story concludes that Spring’s popularity and the gratitude of mankind are worth more than Winter’s ability to intimidate. This aligns perfectly with the idea that it is better to be loved than feared.

Everyone wondered at this, since the new horse was neithe",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** The Soldier possesses a superior horse (beautiful and useful).
2.  **The Action:** He acquires an inferior horse and proceeds to give it significantly more attention and care than the superior one.
3.  **The Conflict/Irony:** The observers note the lack of logic in this behavior, as the new horse is objectively worse in every way.
4.  **The Explanation:** The quote ""it's natural to be fond of the newest arrival"" explains that the soldier's behavior is driven by the novelty of the new acquisition, rather than its actual merit or worthiness.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A:** Suggests that things please only temporarily. While related to ""novelty,"" the story specifically emphasizes the preference for something *lesser* over something *better*.
*   **B and D:** These deals with contentment or the ""wickedness"" of man, which are not themes present in this fable.
*   **C:** The story actually shows the soldier ignoring both beauty *and* usefulness in favor of the new horse, so this is incorrect.
*   **E:** This captures the central theme: the soldier is neglecting the horse that ""truly deserves"" care (the excellent one) in favor of the one that is ""less worthy"" (the inferior one), simply because it is new.

In Aesopic traditions, this fable underscores the human tendency to be distracted by novelty and to value new, inferior things over proven, superior ones.

A Kite saw him and exclaimed: 'You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no bus",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A seagull attempts to eat a fish that is too large for it. This results in a physical injury (a burst gullet) that leads to its death.
2.  **The Critique:** A Kite (a bird of prey that typically hunts land animals) observes the dying seagull. Instead of offering sympathy, it mocks the seagull for hunting in the sea, arguing that a ""bird of the air"" has no business seeking food in the water.
3.  **The Core Conflict:** The story highlights a creature overstepping its natural boundaries or ""sphere."" The seagull's death is attributed (by the kite) to acting outside of its proper station or nature.
4.  **Traditional Context:** This is an Aesop's Fable. Historically, the moral attached to this specific fable (The Seagull and the Kite) emphasizes that individuals should stick to their own domains and expertise rather than meddling in affairs that do not belong to them.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Every man should be content to mind his own business:** This aligns perfectly with the Kite's commentary that the seagull should not have been seeking food from the sea, as it was outside its ""business"" as a bird of the air.
*   **B) Learn from past misfortunes:** The seagull dies, so it cannot learn from this misfortune.
*   **C) Greed breeds misfortune...:** While the seagull was ""greedy"" by taking too large a fish, the specific dialogue focuses on the *nature* of the business (sea vs. air).
*   **D) ...means of our own destruction:** This moral belongs to fables like ""The Eagle and the Arrow.""
*   **E) Patience is key:** This is not relevant to the seagull's impulsive eating or the kite's judgment.

The most accurate moral reflecting the Kite's judgment and the seagull's failure to respect its limits is that one should stick to their own sphere of life.

morables_145,"There were once some foxes who had gathered together on the banks of the River Meander looking for a drink of water. They urged one another to approach the river, but no one dared to get too close bec",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the sequence of events and the characters' motivations:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of foxes is thirsty, but the river is dangerous and rushing. Most of the foxes are cautious because they recognize the danger.
2.  **The Action:** One fox decides to show off. Her motivation isn't just to get a drink, but to ""embarrass her fellow foxes"" and prove she is ""braver than the rest.""
3.  **The Consequence:** She leaps in and is immediately swept away by the current, losing control of the situation and endangering her life.
4.  **The Reaction:** When her companions call out to her, she realizes she is in a humiliating and dangerous position. Instead of admitting her mistake, she makes up a boastful excuse (carrying a message to Miletus) to save face while she is being swept to her potential death.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** Fits perfectly. The fox's boasting and desire to mock others led her to take a foolish risk that resulted in hers being swept away.
*   **B:** There is no mention of ""profit"" or ""greed"" in the traditional sense; it is about pride and bravado.
*   **C:** This contradicts the story; boldness did not quench her thirst, it likely led to her drowning.
*   **D:** While she tried to mock others, the focus of the fable's ending is on her boastful excuse for her failure.
*   **E:** This suggests the fox's action was positive or necessary, whereas the fable portrays it as a foolish mistake born of arrogance.

In Aesopic fables, this specific story (Perry Index 17) is traditionally used to illustrate that those who bring misfortune upon themselves through their own blustering or arrogance often try to disguise their failure with further lies or boasts.

1.  **The Lion's Conflict:** The lion attempts to be a fair king but cannot change his predatory nature. He craves meat but needs a ""just"" excuse to kill.
2.  **The First Trick:** He asks animals if his breath smells. If they are honest and say ""yes,"" he kills them for being insulting. If they lie and say ""no,"" he kills them for being sycophants or liars. This demonstrates that no matter what the animals say, the outcome is death.
3.  **The Monkey's Flattery:** The monkey tries a third path—extreme, poetic flattery (claiming the breath smells like cinnamon/the altar of the gods). While this momentarily halts the lion, the lion simply invents a new excuse (nausea/doctor's orders) to eat him anyway.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that when a powerful predator (or tyrant) is determined to harm you, it does not matter how you respond. Whether you speak the truth, tell a lie, or use clever flattery, the result is the same. The lion's ""fairness"" is a facade, and the fate of the prey is sealed regardless of their words.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. Whether the animals spoke truthfully (bad smell) or the monkey spoke with flattery (cinnamon), they were all killed. The ""penalty"" remained the same regardless of the speech.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there are no ""old friends"" vs ""new acquaintances"" in this story.
*   **C:** This describes the monkey's action, but the story's focus is on the lion's inevitability. Moreover, the monkey’s flattery didn’t mask intentions; it failed to save him.
*   **D:** This is a variant of a moral from a different fable (The Donkey in the Lion’s Skin/The Crow and the Fox).
*   **E:** This is a literal summary of the lion's *stated* goal, but the story proves this goal was a failure and a lie.

The core lesson is that for a victim in the clutches of a tyrant, there is no ""correct"" thing to say—the outcome is predetermined by the tyrant's nature.

The partridge immediately started squawking his usual song, sauntering through every room in the house un",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the behavior of the characters and the conflict between them.

1.  **The Characters:** We have a new arrival (the partridge) and a long-term resident (the weasel). 
2.  **The Conflict:** The partridge enters the house and immediately behaves with great noise and confidence (""squawking,"" ""sauntering,"" ""cackling""), occupying the space as if he owns it despite being there for only one day. 
3.  **The Weasel’s Argument:** The weasel points out that even though she was born in the house and has lived there for a long time, she remains quiet and humble. She questions the partridge's right to be so loud and forward when he is a complete newcomer who hasn't yet earned his place or understood the ""rules"" of the home.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the arrogance of a newcomer who disregards the established environment or the behavior of those who have been there longer. It suggests that one should be humble and observant when entering a new situation or household.

*   **Option A** fits this perfectly: It suggests that a newcomer should respect the existing atmosphere and customs rather than imposing their own noise or will immediately.
*   **Option B** is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **Option C** is incorrect because the partridge's confidence actually puts him at a disadvantage/argumentative loss with the weasel.
*   **Option D** is a possible secondary interpretation (the bird's vanity/noise is annoying), but the dialogue specifically focuses on the length of residency and the right to speak, making A the most precise fit.
*   **Option E** is too abstract and doesn't address the social dynamic between the two animals.

The primary lesson is that a newcomer should not be overbearing or loud in a place where they have just arrived, especially compared to those who have resided there quietly for a long time.

Stung by the sharp pain,",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** The fox is in a moment of vulnerability (falling) and reaches out for instinctive help from the nearest source.
2.  **The Conflict:** The fox chooses a bramble bush—a plant naturally covered in thorns. When the fox is hurt, she accuses the bush of being ""cruel"" for hurting someone who only wanted help.
3.  **The Resolution:** The bramble bush points out the fox's mistake: the bush’s nature is to ""grab"" (sting/scratch) everything it touches. It is not an act of targeted malice, but a fundamental characteristic of its being.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fox's injury was avoidable if she had considered the nature of what she was grabbing. You cannot expect a harmful or ""thorny"" entity to change its nature just because you are in need.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) It is foolish to expect help from someone who is naturally unkind:** This fits the story perfectly. The bramble is ""naturally unkind"" (thorny), and the fox was foolish to expect it to provide safe support.
*   **B) No one should boast...:** This relates to a different fable (The Fox and the Cat), not this one.
*   **C) Cruelty stings the sharpest:** While the pain stung, the lesson is about the *fox's error* in judgment, not the intensity of the pain itself.
*   **D) A single sharp skill...:** This also relates to ""The Fox and the Cat.""
*   **E) In seeking support, be mindful of the harm it may cause:** This is close, but the fable specifically emphasizes the *nature* of the entity being asked for help, which aligns better with Choice A.

The most accurate moral is that seeking assistance from those who are naturally harmful or antagonistic will only lead to further injury.

But the fuller told him, 'How on earth would I be able to carr",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the roles and the conflict:

1.  **The Charcoal Burner:** His profession involves soot, smoke, and black dust. His work is inherently messy and dark.
2.  **The Fuller:** His profession involves cleaning and whitening cloth. His work is inherently about purity and cleanliness.
3.  **The Conflict:** If they live together, the byproduct of the charcoal burner's work (soot) will ruin the product of the fuller's work (white cloth). 

**Step-by-step Lesson:**
*   The story illustrates that two people with fundamentally different natures or goals often cannot coexist in a shared space without one negatively impacting the other.
*   The charcoal burner's offer is friendly, but impractical because his essence (dirt/soot) is the direct enemy of the fuller's purpose (cleanliness).
*   Historically, this Aesop's fable is used to teach that **opposites or incompatible people cannot live or work together successfully** because their basic natures will clash.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Opposites are utterly incompatible.** This matches the logic that the ""black"" work of the burner and the ""white"" work of the fuller cannot mix.
*   B) Appearances can be deceiving. (Not relevant; their appearances accurately reflect their work).
*   C) Caution cleans inconsiderate actions. (Doesn't fit the context).
*   D) Clean honesty is the best cautious policy. (While the fuller is honest, the story is more about the practical impossibility of the arrangement).
*   E) Shared spaces require shared understanding. (While true, it doesn't capture the inherent incompatibility emphasized in the text).

The most traditional and accurate moral for this specific fable is that those who are fundamentally different or whose interests conflict are incompatible.

1.  **The Crime:** A murderer is caught red-handed and runs away.
2.  **The Deception:** When questioned about his bloody hands, he shifts the blame to an innocent object—a mulberry tree—claiming the red stains are merely juice from its fruit.
3.  **The Resolution:** The murderer is caught and executed on that very tree.
4.  **The Tree's Statement:** The tree explicitly states that it is happy to assist in the execution because the man tried to ""smear"" its reputation with his own crime.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **B, C, and D** do not align with the specific interactions between the murderer and the tree.
*   **E** is a reasonable observation about the man's lie, but it misses the ""punishment"" and ""vindication"" themes found in the tree's final speech.
*   **A** captures the essence of the tree's reaction. The tree acts as a stand-in for an ""honest"" entity that has been slandered (accused of being the source of blood/guilt). Because the man tried to frame the tree for his gore, the tree (and by extension, the natural order) does not hesitate to participate in his downfall. This fable is often cataloged in Aesopic collections with the moral that those who are slandered will not hesitate to see their slanderer punished.

The tree’s dialogue specifically highlights the injury done to its ""reputation"" by the man's lie, justifying its role in his execution.

The lion woke up and immediately grabbed the wretched little mouse with his paw,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the relationship between the characters:

1.  **The Small Proves Worthy:** The lion initially views the mouse as ""wretched"" and ""tiny,"" believing that killing it would bring no glory because the mouse is insignificant.
2.  **The Act of Mercy:** Despite his power, the lion shows kindness and lets the mouse go.
3.  **The Reversal of Fortune:** The powerful lion becomes helpless (trapped in a pit/cords), while the ""tiny"" mouse possesses exactly the right tool (teeth for gnawing) to save him.
4.  **The Lesson:** The lion’s earlier small act of kindness is directly returned, proving that even a small creature can assist a great one.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted:** This perfectly captures the theme. The lion's mercy (the act) toward a small creature (the scale) resulted in his own life being saved later.
*   **B)** Incorrect; the match resulted in mutual benefit, not misery.
*   **C)** While the mouse was clever, the story focuses more on the *repayment of kindness* rather than intellectual superiority.
*   **D)** Incorrect; the mouse was genuinely grateful and helpful.
*   **E)** This is a general statement about cause and effect, but it misses the specific ethical lesson regarding mercy and gratitude found in Aesop’s fables.

The story belongs to the tradition of Aesop, where the central theme is that even the most powerful may one day need the help of the weakest, and kindness is always rewarded.

4.  **The Lesson:** Gaia states that humans may take what they want (sustenance), but it will come with ""groans and tears""—representing the backbreaking labor, struggle, and suffering associated with survival and farming.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A** captures the essence of the ending: while humans gained a way to survive, it came with a significant cost of toil and hardship.
*   **B** is less relevant because Gaia *did* yield to a more powerful force (Zeus), but the story's focus is on the consequence for the humans.
*   **C** is a secondary observation (Zeus/Hermes forcing Gaia), but fables usually focus on the human condition or a general truth about life.
*   **D** and **E** are not supported by the specific ""groans and tears"" warning.

The story serves as an etiological myth explaining why the labor of survival is so difficult. It emphasizes that gaining sustenance from the earth is not a free gift, but an arduous trade.

morables_232,"A dog went into a butcher's shop and stole the heart of some animal. The butcher turned around and said to him, 'You haven't stolen my heart; indeed, I have taken heart from this lesson! So if you eve",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Event:** A dog successfully steals a piece of meat (a heart) from a butcher's shop.
2.  **The Reaction:** The butcher, instead of merely being angry, uses wordplay regarding the ""heart."" He explains that while he lost physical property, he gained ""heart"" (meaning courage or mental fortitude) and a valuable lesson.
3.  **The Lesson:** The butcher acknowledges that he was caught off guard, but because of this experience, he will be vigilant and prepared to punish the dog if it tries again.
4.  **The Underlying Theme:** The story focuses on the butcher becoming wiser through a negative experience. He has learned to be cautious and will not be fooled a second time.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Experience teaches valuable lessons and encourages caution:** This aligns perfectly with the butcher's statement that he ""taken heart from this lesson"" and will be ready next time.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** This usually applies to stories where an animal's instincts override its training; not applicable here.
*   **C) Boldness without caution leads astray:** While the dog was bold, the focus of the dialogue is on the butcher's newfound wisdom.
*   **D) Better to face a bold, known danger...:** This relates to trusting enemies/friends, which isn't the primary theme here.
*   **E) Desire can lead to actions that betray trust:** There was no trust between the dog and the butcher to begin with.

The dialogue explicitly highlights that an oversight led to a lesson that will prevent future misfortune. This is the definition of learning from experience.

morables_498,"There was a bullock who had been turned loose in the fields without ever having borne the burden of the yoke. When he saw a hard-working bull who was pulling a plow, the bullock said to him, 'You poor",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1.  **Analyze the Characters:** The story contrasts two characters: a young bullock who lives a life of leisure and an older bull who performs constant, exhausting labor.
2.  **The Conflict:** The young bullock mocks the older bull for his hard work, feeling superior because he is free from the yoke. The older bull remains silent, accepting his burden.
3.  **The Turning Point:** The situation reverses. The hardworking bull is rewarded with rest (unvoked and led to pasture), while the idle bullock is revealed to have been ""fattened up"" or kept idle for a specific, grim purpose: sacrifice.
4.  **The Realization:** The older bull points out that the bullock's lack of work was not a privilege, but a precursor to a fatal end. The bullock's ""easy life"" resulted in his early death, while the bull's ""hard life"" resulted in his continued survival.
5.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A) He laughs best that laughs last:** This fits the narrative arc perfectly. The bullock laughed at the bull's misfortune early on, but in the end, it is the bull who survives and has the final word as the bullock faces the axe.
    *   **B) The great do not always prevail:** Not relevant; the story is about work vs. idleness/fate.
    *   **C) Wisdom tempers youthful naivety:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific irony of the bullock's mockery versus his fate.
    *   **D) He that is neither...:** This is nonsensical/grammatically confusing in this context.
    *   **E) One should not judge others...:** While applicable, fables of this specific type (The Bull and the Bullock) are traditionally categorized under the theme of ""he who laughs last"" or ""the perils of idleness/the purpose of sacrifice."" The bull's final speech specifically mocks the bullock's earlier arrogance.

**Conclusion:** The fable (often attributed to Aesop) serves as a warning against mocking the struggles of others when your own easy path may lead to a worse end. The bull gets the ""final laugh"" or the final word.

morables_174,It is common to take Maltese dogs and pet monkeys on long sea voyages in order to relieve the boredom of the passage. A man who was planning to make such a voyage had brought his monkey along with him,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A monkey is saved by a dolphin during a shipwreck because the dolphin mistakes him for a human.
2.  **The Deception:** To appear more important or knowledgeable than he actually is, the monkey lies about his origins and claims to come from an ""illustrious family.""
3.  **The Exposure:** When asked about Piraeus (a famous harbor), the monkey mistakenly thinks it is a person and claims it is a ""near and dear friend."" This confirms to the dolphin that the monkey is a liar.
4.  **The Consequence:** Because of his pretentiousness and dishonesty, the dolphin stops helping the monkey and drowns him.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the monkey's behavior. He pretended to be a human/Athenian (what he was not) and ended up ""in deep water"" (both literally and figuratively).
*   **B:** Irrelevant to the story.
*   **C:** The plans were not helpful; they were deceptive.
*   **D:** This is poorly phrased and doesn't capture the essence of the monkey's specific failure.
*   **E:** The companionship actually led to death because of the monkey's dishonesty, so this is the opposite of the lesson.

The lesson is that boasting or lying about oneself to gain status or favor often leads to exposure and downfall.

morables_25,"A Certain House was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this, made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character's reactions:

1.  **The Situation:** The Mice are in danger because the Cat has been eating them.
2.  **The Reaction:** To protect themselves, the Mice stay in their holes (caution).
3.  **The Deception:** The Cat attempts to trick the Mice by pretending to be dead (playing on their potential naivety/hunger).
4.  **The Resolution:** The Mice recognize the Cat’s nature and refuse to fall for the trick. They have learned from their previous dangerous encounters that the Cat is an enemy, regardless of what form she takes or how she presents herself.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) He who is once deceived is doubly cautious:** This fits perfectly. The Mice have seen the Cat’s true nature (the predator who eats them). Because of this past experience, they are now extremely cautious and are not fooled by the Cat’s new trick (hanging like a meal-bag).
*   **B) Beware of when the powerful and the deceitful collaborate:** There is only one antagonist (the Cat) here, not a collaboration.
*   **C) Caution tempers cunning:** While partial, it doesn't capture the specific element of *past experience* leading to the Mice's current wisdom.
*   **D) Relying too much on cunning subordinates...:** There are no subordinates in this story.
*   **E) Unchecked problems...:** This describes the Cat's arrival, but not the ultimate lesson learned by the survivors.

The classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Cat and the Mice"") is that wise people are not fooled by those who have already shown themselves to be dangerous.

Just as he was about to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and wak",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the dialogue and the situation presented in the fable:

1.  **The Action:** A traveler chooses to sleep on the edge of a deep well—a precarious and dangerous position. 
2.  **The Dialogue:** Dame Fortune wakes him, not out of pure altruism, but to protect her own reputation. She explicitly states that if he falls, people will blame ""bad luck"" (Fortune) rather than the traveler's own foolish decision to sleep in a dangerous spot.
3.  **The Lesson:** The core piece of the message is Fortune’s concluding remark: ""...men are sure to impute their calamities to me, however much by their own folly they have really brought them on themselves.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Everyone is more or less master of his own fate:** This aligns with the idea that our ""calamities"" are often the result of our own ""folly"" rather than external luck or destiny. It emphasizes personal responsibility.
*   **B) Every tale is not to be believed:** This is a generic moral not supported by this specific text.
*   **C) Guard your energy wisely:** While the traveler was tired, the story focuses on the *blame* and the *location* of his rest, not the mismanagement of his energy.
*   **D) He who incites to concerned strife...:** This is unrelated to the context of the story.
*   **E) Exhaustion can lead to perilous oversight:** While true in reality, the personified Dame Fortune specifically addresses the concept of **blame** and **personal accountability**, making ""A"" the classical moral associated with this Aesopic fable.

The fable teaches that we often blame ""bad luck"" for disasters that we actually brought upon ourselves through lack of care.

1.  **Plot Summary**: The trees provide a man with the material (the olive wood handle) he needs to complete his tool (the axe). Once the tool is complete, the man immediately uses it to destroy the very trees that assisted him.
2.  **Key Actions**: The trees enabled their own destruction by providing the essential component their ""enemy"" lacked.
3.  **The Oak's Reflection**: The oak tree explicitly notes that their suffering is a direct result of their own choice to provide the handle: ""It serves us right, since we gave our enemy the handle he asked for!""
4.  **Evaluating the Options**:
    *   **A**: This directly aligns with the oak's reflection. By helping someone who has the potential to harm you, you facilitate your own downfall.
    *   **B**: While related to power dynamics, the story is more about a voluntary (if naive) gift rather than being injured with ""impunity.""
    *   **C**: This is a plausible interpretation, but it is a broader philosophical take. Most traditional versions of this Aesop fable focus specifically on the danger of arming an enemy.
    *   **D**: This focuses on coercion, but the trees in the story acted of their own volition (they ""selected the wood"").
    *   **E**: This does not fit the narrative of the axe and the trees.

The primary lesson is that the trees' downfall was a result of their own failure to foresee how their gift would be used against them. Helping an adversary (or a potential adversary) is self-destructive.

The crab said to her, 'O mother, lead the way, and I will try to walk accordingly.",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events:
1.  **The Demand:** The mother crab criticizes her son for walking crookedly and instructs him to walk straight (a ""precept"" or rule).
2.  **The Challenge:** The son asks her to show him how to do it (asking for an ""example"").
3.  **The Result:** The mother is physically unable to follow her own instructions.

The story highlights the futility of giving advice or instructions that the teacher cannot or does not follow themselves. It teaches that showing how to do something (example) is far more effective and credible than simply telling someone what to do (precept).

*   **A) Example is more powerful than precept:** This matches the story perfectly. The son is willing to follow if shown, but the mother's inability to provide the example renders her words useless.
*   **B) Contentment...:** The story isn't about happiness or contentment; it's about behavior and instruction.
*   **C) Those who cannot see the path...:** While the mother is guiding him ""astray"" in a sense, the focus is on her hypocrisy/inability to act, not her lack of vision.
*   **D) Hypocritical equals...:** While hypocrisy is involved, the relationship is mother/son, and ""best friends"" is not the point.
*   **E) Even the crooked can find their way...:** This is the opposite of the ending, as the son does not find his way; he mocks his mother.

The classic moral of this Aesop's fable is that one should not criticize others for flaws they possess themselves, or more simply, that example is better than rule.

When the fox found out about this she paid a visit to the wolf a,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the themes:

1.  **The Characters:** Both the wolf and the fox are depicted as traditionally ""dishonest"" characters. The wolf has a ""store of booty"" (stolen goods), and the fox is motivated by greed and vengeance.
2.  **The Conflict:** The wolf treats the fox with spite, refusing to share his stolen goods. In retaliation, the fox betrays the wolf to the shepherd.
3.  **The Resolution:** The wolf is killed due to the fox's betrayal. However, the fox does not enjoy her victory for long; she is caught by hunters and explicitly acknowledges her ""serious crime"" as she dies.
4.  **The Central Theme:** The story illustrates a cycle of betrayal and destruction among those who live by theft or deceit. The wolf is killed, and the fox, through the same treachery she used against the wolf, meets her own end.

Reviewing the options:
*   **A) Take pleasure when thieves destroy themselves:** This aligns with the ""poetic justice"" found in the story. Both the wolf (a thief) and the fox (a deceptive traitor) end up destroyed. Traditionally, in Aesop's fables and similar literature (like Babrius or Phaedrus), this specific story is categorized under the moral that it is good for the world when villains/thieves eliminate one another.
*   **B) Never trust a known deceiver:** While true, it doesn't cover the fox's eventual downfall.
*   **C, D, E:** These options either misinterpret the characters' motivations or miss the tragic ending of the fox.

The primary lesson focuses on the fact that when dishonest beings (thieves/villains) plot against each other, their mutual destruction is a positive outcome for the rest of society (represented by the shepherd and the hunters).

1.  **Initial Action:** The Countryman sees the Eagle in distress and performs a selfless act of kindness by saving it from the Serpent.
2.  **Consequence of the Action:** The Serpent attempts to kill the Countryman out of revenge by poisoning his water.
3.  **Reciprocal Action:** The Eagle, recognizing that the Countryman saved its life, intervenes at a critical moment to save the Countryman's life by knocking the poisoned water away.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core of the story is the exchange of life-saving favors. Because the Countryman helped the Eagle, the Eagle helped the Countryman in return. This demonstrates that kindness is rewarded and that one good deed often leads to another.

While the Serpent's actions are vengeful, the resolution of the story focuses on the Eagle returning the favor to its savior. This is the classic definition of the proverb ""One good turn deserves another.""

His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, My master gives a feast, a",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events:

1.  **The Situation:** A guest (the stranger Dog) enters a home through an informal, unverified invitation (the ""back stairs"" approach) rather than being an official guest of the Master.
2.  **The Outcome:** Because he has no official standing or right to be there, the Cook (who represents the authority of the household) treats him as an intruder and throws him out the window.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story warns against assuming you are welcome in a place where you have not been formally invited by the owner. It highlights the risk of trying to sneak into the benefits of others' wealth or status through unofficial means.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A:** This is the traditional moral associated with this Aesop's fable. ""Entering by the back stairs"" is a metaphor for entering a place through unofficial or sneaky channels; being ""shown out at the window"" refers to the unceremonious and painful ejection that follows.
*   **B:** There were no ""enemies"" in this story, only a misguided friend.
*   **C & E:** While the Rich Man was generous to his friends, the story focuses on the stranger dog's misfortune, making these choices incorrect.
*   **D:** While the dog was naive, the core of the story is about the method of his entry into the house.

1.  **The Character and his Life:** The man is described as ""miserly"" and his wealth is ""ill-gotten."" He spent his life sweating over a hoard of coins.
2.  **The Futility of the Hoard:** At the moment of death, he realzes he cannot take the money with him and asks who will benefit from it.
3.  **The Consequences for Others:** The coins explain that his heirs will waste the money on vice (women and drinks), meaning his ""work"" resulted in the moral decay of his successors.
4.  **The Consequences for the Self:** Because the money was ""ill-gotten"" and gathered through greed, the ""demons"" will claim his soul for eternal torment.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** While the story touches on greed, it specifically emphasizes the *origin* (ill-gotten) and the *aftermath* (torment) of that greed.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; this refers to a different fable (likely related to the ""Frogs asking for a King"").
*   **C:** This matches the core of the bag's message: the wealth was ""ill-gotten"" and the end result is ""eternal torments.""
*   **D:** Irrelevant; this refers to the fable of ""The Fox and the Lion"" or similar lessons on experience.
*   **E:** While true that the legacy wasn't what he might have hoped, the story focuses more heavily on the spiritual punishement for the *nature* of his wealth.

The city mouse finished his business in the country and by means of insistent inv,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The contrast of lifestyles:** The story begins by contrasting the ""humble meal of acorns"" in the country with the ""overflowing food"" and ""delicacies"" of the city.
2.  **The conflict:** While enjoying the abundance of the city, the mice are interrupted by a butler. The city mouse knows where to hide, but the country mouse is terrified and lacks the security of his home environment.
3.  **The resolution:** Despite the city mouse's insistence that the food is the best in the world, the country mouse chooses to return to his humble acorns.
4.  **The concluding statement:** The country mouse says, ""Acorns are enough for me... so long as I am secure in my freedom!"" This emphasizes that peace of mind and security (freedom from fear/worry) are more valuable than luxury accompanied by danger or anxiety.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) It is better to live in self-sufficient poverty than to be tormented by the worries of wealth.** This directly mirrors the country mouse's logic: he prefers humble acorns (poverty) over delicacies if it means he can live without being ""frightened out of his wits"" (tormented by worries).
*   **B) Consider the consequences of your actions.** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific theme of wealth vs. peace.
*   **C) Familiarity can ease the unfamiliar.** This is a secondary observation (the city mouse was safe because he knew the hole), but not the moral lesson.
*   **D) Save a familiar Thief...** This is irrelevant to the plot of this fable.
*   **E) A persuasive invitation...** This describes the plot but does not provide a moral lesson regarding the choice the mouse made.

The core lesson is that a simple life of peace is preferable to a wealthy life of fear.

The beetle then felt contem",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Starting State:** The beetle is ""fully sated"" and secure in his environment (the dung heap).
2.  **The Rise of Arrogance:** Upon seeing the eagle, he becomes dissatisfied with his own nature. He makes arrogant claims, asserting that his voice and appearance are equal to the eagle's and that he is superior to his fellow beetles. He ""puts on airs"" by trying to transition from a ""bug"" to a ""bird.""
3.  **The Action:** He leaves his safe, providing environment to join a society where he does not belong and for which he is biologically unsuited (ignoring the ""strong winds"" of the upper air).
4.  **The Consequence:** He fails miserably, ends up ""shaken and exhausted,"" and finds himself far from home and facing starvation.
5.  **The Lesson:** He realizes that his ambition was foolish and that he has lost the security he once had.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the story. The beetle's arrogance led him to abandon his position, resulting in a failure to move up and the loss of his original comfort.
*   **B)** This is the moral of a different Aesop fable (The Eagle and the Beetle), where the beetle gets revenge on the eagle. It does not fit this specific text.
*   **C)** The story is a cautionary tale against trying to be something you are not, rather than a celebration of diversity.
*   **D)** This refers to physical force, which is not relevant here.
*   **E)** While the beetle had a moment of wonder, the story emphasizes the disastrous consequences of his pride, not the beauty of the wonder itself.

I can't decide what to do: my love of money and my innat",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the narrative elements:

1.  **The Conflict:** The protagonist discovers an object of immense value (a golden lion). He is driven by two competing traits: greed (desire for the gold) and cowardice (fear of the lion shape, despite it being inanimate gold).
2.  **The Paralysis:** The man spends his time agonizing over the dilemma rather than benefiting from the find. He describes the gold as a ""treasure that offers no satisfaction"" because his fear prevents him from touching it.
3.  **The Character's Solution:** Instead of overcoming his fear, he decides to stay at a distance and have others take the risk for him. This emphasizes that his nature prevents him from a direct relationship with his wealth.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Wealth is of little value if one is too afraid to use or enjoy it:** This directly addresses the man's lament (""O treasure that offers no satisfaction!"") and the central irony of the story—owning or finding gold is useless if one's character (cowardice) prevents them from claiming or utilizing it.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** This is a common moral for fables involving animals disguised as others, but less applicable here.
*   **C) Greed blinds the cowardly:** While he is greedy and cowardly, his greed isn't ""blinding"" him; rather, his cowardice is making him hyper-aware of a perceived danger.
*   **D) It is better to serve...:** This does not fit the hierarchy of the story.
*   **E) Indecision is the thief of opportunity:** While he is indecisive, the root cause is his cowardice regarding the specific nature of the wealth.

The most accurate moral, consistent with Aesop's themes (this is Aesop's Fable 194), is that a man's character can render even the greatest stroke of fortune useless. If you are afraid of the ""lion,"" you cannot possess the ""gold.""

When opinions were exchanged back and forth, the ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the animals step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** The animals gather to address grievances. The hares, who are physically weak and prone to being preyed upon, propose a system of total equality and shared power.
2.  **The Hares' Argument:** They argue that it is ""fair"" for everyone to be equal so that the strong cannot exploit the weak. Their argument is based on the abstract ideal of justice.
3.  **The Lions' Response:** The lions do not necessarily disagree with the *logic* of the hares' words (they call them ""good""), but they point out a physical reality: the hares lack the ""claws and teeth"" to enforce or back up such a demand.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates that high-minded ideals and demands for equality are often ineffective unless those making the demands have the power or means to defend their position. In a world governed by power dynamics, words alone cannot compel the strong to give up their advantage.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Be prepared to defend your position:** This aligns with the lions' point. A claim to rights or equality is empty if you cannot back it up or defend it against those who hold power.
*   **B) Usefulness:** This is the moral of ""The Lion and the Mouse,"" not this story.
*   **C) Fairness:** The story actually suggests that strength often overrides fairness in natural or political power structures.
*   **D) Love vs. Fear:** The story focuses on power and physical capability, not the emotional state of the subjects.
*   **E) Open dialogue:** While dialogue occurred, it led to a dismissal of the hares’ grievances rather than a resolution, highlighting the futility of the hares' request.

The core lesson is that ""fine words"" require ""claws and teeth"" (substance/power) to be effective.

There was a whole crowd of monkeys there and one of them ,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character motivations:

1.  **The Characters:** There are two men—one a liar and one a truth-teller—and a group of monkeys led by a chief who is mimicking human imperial grandeur.
2.  **The Situation:** The chief monkey is vain and seeks validation for his self-important fantasy (pretending to be an emperor).
3.  **The Response to Deception:** The liar recognizes the monkey's vanity and provides flattery. He is richly rewarded because the monkey prefers a pleasing lie over reality.
4.  **The Response to Truth:** The truth-teller assumes that truth is inherently more valuable than lies and will be rewarded accordingly. However, by stating the plain truth (""You are simply a monkey""), he insults the leader's ego.
5.  **The Consequence:** Because the truth contradicts the leader's desired image, the leader reacts with violence.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Those who thrive on deception often retaliate against those who speak the truth.** This fits perfectly. The monkeys are living a lie (the ""emperor"" setup), and when the truth-teller shatters that illusion, they attack him.
*   **B) It is difficult to truly know a person.** This is irrelevant to the plot; the nature of the characters is clear from the start.
*   **C) Flattery deceives the naive.** While true, this is only half the story. The focus of the climax is the punishment of the truth-teller, not just the success of the liar.
*   **D) Naive familiarity mollifies even the most terrifying things.** This does not reflect the aggressive ending of the story.
*   **E) In the land of deception, truth is its own defense.** The story proves the opposite; the truth was not a defense at all—it led to the man's injury.

The fable serves as a cynical warning: in environments built on vanity and lies, speaking the truth can be dangerous because it offends those in power.

This slave-woman, bedecked with gold and trailing a delicate purple robe aro",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this story, let’s analyze the key events and interactions:

1.  **The Situation:** A man is infatuated with a woman who is explicitly described as ""ugly"" and ""wicked."" He showers her with riches and status she has not earned.
2.  **The Woman's Action:** She believes her success is due to her own beauty (bestowed by Aphrodite) and acts with arrogance toward the man's wife. 
3.  **The Divine Intervention:** Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty, intervenes to clarify the truth. She explicitly states that she did not make the woman beautiful. 
4.  **The Climax:** Aphrodite expresses ""fury"" or contempt for the man's judgment. She views his attraction to something ""ugly"" as an affront to her domain (beauty).

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A:** This aligns with the classical interpretation of the fable. In Greek mythology and Aesop's fables, a man loving something objectively ""ugly"" or ""wicked"" was often seen as a sign of divine madness or a curse. Aphrodite’s anger confirms that the man's perception is distorted and offensive to the gods.
*   **B:** There is no mention of a conscience or guilt in the story.
*   **C:** Generosity (from the man) is depicted as misplaced and foolish, not as something that improves the situation.
*   **D:** The woman is not ""beautiful,"" as the goddess herself points out.
*   **E:** The story explicitly mocks the woman's character (""wicked"") and appearance (""ugly""). Aphrodite's rejection of her suggests the story is not about ""inner beauty,"" but rather about the man's lack of sense.

In the original context of Aesop's fables, this story (fable 305 in the Perry Index) carries the lesson that a man who finds beauty in what is objectively ugly or wicked is suffering from a delusion that is displeasing to the gods of beauty.

Aesop therefore shared this little story with the father,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this story, let's analyze the lesson step by step:

1.  **Analyze the Conflict:** The father has a son with a ""vicious adolescent temper"" who is harming the household (the slaves). The father’s current approach isn't working because the son acts out ""whenever his father wasn't looking.""
2.  **Analyze the Metaphor:** The farmer yokes an old, experienced bull with a wild, young bull. The purpose is not to increase the workload, but for the ""moderation"" and presence of the old bull to physically and temperamentally ""keep the young bull in check.""
3.  **Identify the Lesson:** Aesop explicitly interprets the metaphor for the father: the father must keep the boy ""beside him"" so that his own ""moderation"" can ""restrain"" the boy's ""reckless inclinations.""
4.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A:** While the story mentions moderation, ""mild disposition"" is slightly passive compared to the active restraint required.
    *   **B:** This pertains to aging and is irrelevant to the lesson about the son's behavior.
    *   **C:** This captures the essence of the ""old bull"" (wisdom/moderation) being used to ""temper"" (restrain/cool) the ""reckless aggression"" of the youth.
    *   **D:** This is the moral of *The Tortoise and the Hare*, not applicable here.
    *   **E:** This is a true statement about the situation, but it describes the *consequence* of failing to follow the advice, rather than the *lesson* (the solution) the story provides.

The core lesson is that the presence and guidance of those with a temperate, wise nature are necessary to control and correct those with violent, reckless tendencies.

All the other passengers started to swim, but the Athenian kept praying to Athena, maki",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A ship capsizes during a storm. All passengers are in life-threatening danger.
2.  **The Actions:** The majority of the passengers take immediate physical action (swimming) to save themselves. The wealthy Athenian, however, relies solely on divine intervention (praying and making promises to Athena) without exerting any physical effort.
3.  **The Dialogue/Climax:** A fellow passenger points out the flaw in the Athenian's logic: he is asking for help while doing nothing to help himself.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that faith or reliance on outside help is not a substitute for personal action. This is the origin of the famous proverb, ""Athena helps those who move their own arms"" (closely related to ""God helps those who help themselves"").

**Evaluating the choices:**
*   **A) Self-effort is essential:** This directly matches the lesson that one must act (move their arms) alongside seeking help.
*   **B) A learned man has always a fund of riches in himself:** This is the moral of a different Aesop fable (*Simonides*). 
*   **C) True power lies in practicality:** While related, ""Self-effort"" is a more precise description of the specific action required in the story.
*   **D) Powerful opposites...:** This is abstract and irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) True character is revealed when the tides turn:** While character is revealed, the specific focus of the dialogue is on the necessity of action (effort) over passive reliance.

The core message is that one must strive for their own salvation through effort rather than relying solely on providence.

morables_607,"A Frog and a Mouse, who had long been rivals for the sovereignty of a certain marsh, and had many a skirmish and running fight together, agreed one day to settle the matter, once for all, by a fair an",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Conflict:** A Frog and a Mouse are obsessed with a rivalry over who rules a marsh.
2.  **The Escalation:** They decide to settle their trivial dispute through a fight to the death, focusing entirely on each other.
3.  **The Outcome:** Because they are so preoccupied with their internal quarrel, they fail to notice a mutual predator (the Kite) watching from above.
4.  **The Consequence:** Both are captured and killed by the Kite while they are busy fighting.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) When fools fight others run away with the prize.** This is a common moral for similar fables (like the Lion and the Bear), but it implies a third party wins the *marsh*. Here, the characters lose their lives.
*   **B) People who do harm to others destroy themselves in the bargain.** While true, this usually refers to malice backfiring, not external predators.
*   **C) Stay vigilant against hidden threats.** This is close, but lacks the context of why they weren't vigilant (the rivalry).
*   **D) Be observant before you make a predatory leap.** This would apply to the Kite, not the main characters.
*   **E) Rivalries can blind us to the greater dangers lurking nearby.** This perfectly captures the essence of the Frog and the Mouse. Their ""skirmish"" blinded them to the Kite, leading to their mutual destruction. In classical collections of Aesop's Fables, this story (The Frog and the Mouse) is traditionally used to illustrate how civil or petty strife leaves the combatants vulnerable to a common enemy.

While A is a very common moral for fables involving conflict, **A** specifically describes the redistribution of a contested prize. In this specific fable, the primary takeaway is how their mutual obsession with their rivalry caused them to overlook a terminal threat.

However, in the most famous historical translations of Aesop (such as Townsend’s or James’s), the moral is most frequently summarized as: **""When fools fight, others run away with the prize""** (or some variation of a third party benefiting from the dispute). The Kite ""takes the prize"" (the combatants themselves as food).

Between A and E, **A** is the traditional, proverbial moral associated with this specific fable in standard literary collections.

The surviving daughter wondered to see strangers so much concerned at the loss of her sister, and he",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the fable's lesson:

1.  **Analyze the characters:** The story features a grieving family and ""mourners"" who are hired strangers.
2.  **Observe the conflict:** The surviving daughter is confused because the strangers (the hired mourners) appear to be grieving more intensely than the actual family members.
3.  **Identify the turning point:** The mother explains the discrepancy. She notes that the family has no practical gain from public displays of crying (""never the better for crying""), whereas the strangers are performing a service specifically because they are being paid (""the strangers have money for it"").
4.  **Determine the theme:** The core of the story is the contrast between genuine private emotion and performative public action driven by financial gain. It highlights that the ""mourners"" are professionals whose display of grief is a commodity.
5.  **Evaluate the options:**
    *   (A) directly addresses the mother's explanation that the strangers' grief is a paid service.
    *   (B), (C), (D), and (E) misinterpret the dynamic; the story is not about virtue, curiosity's danger, or shared sorrow, but about the transactional nature of the professional mourners.

1.  **The Premise:** A personification of ""Truth"" is found alone in the desert, far away from human civilization.
2.  **The Conflict:** The traveler is surprised to see Truth in such a desolate place and asks why she has abandoned the city.
3.  **The Explanation:** Truth explains that in the past, lies were rare and limited to a few people. However, in the present age, falsehood has become so pervasive and widespread (""spread throughout all of human society"") that Truth can no longer find a home among people.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story laments the universal corruption of honesty. It suggests that deception has become a fundamental characteristic of modern human interaction, driving Truth into exile.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Falsehood is with all men:** This directly mirrors the ending where Truth says lies have ""spread throughout all of human society.""
*   **B) He who claims any good...:** This relates to a different fable about pride or divinity.
*   **C) Curiosity uncovers hidden truths:** While the man is curious, the focus of the story is the state of human society, not the act of discovery.
*   **D) Even beneficial things appear drastic...:** This is a moral typically associated with fables about medicine or discipline.
*   **E) Compassion can be a guiding light:** While the traveler is concerned, the story’s point is the cynicism regarding society's honesty.

The core message is that lying has become a universal human trait.

As the ox stru",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events step by step:

1.  **The Conflict**: A donkey and an ox are tasked with pulling a load together. The ox is injured but works hard, while the donkey refuses to help.
2.  **The Consequence of Selfishness**: Because the donkey refuses to share the burden, the ox is overworked and dies.
3.  **The Transfer of the Burden**: Once the ox is dead, the donkey is forced to carry the entire load plus the weight of the ox's carcass.
4.  **The Final Outcome**: The donkey, now overwhelmed by the total weight he refused to share earlier, collapses and dies.
5.  **The Lesson**: The birds point out that if the donkey had helped his partner (the ox) at the beginning, he would have lived.

Choice **A** directly reflects this sequence of events: by failing to support a neighbor/partner, their portion of the burden becomes your own, eventually leading to your own downfall. Choices B, C, D, and E either miss the communal aspect of the burden or focus on themes (like ""hard work"") that do not fit the tragic ending for both parties.

1.  **The Origin of Modesty:** The story explains that because Man was created in a hurry, Modesty was omitted. Jupiter decides to introduce it later as an external force shared among people rather than an internal component.
2.  **The Condition:** Modesty agrees to exist among humans, but she sets one specific, non-negotiable condition: she will not stay in the presence of ""carnal love"" (lust or physical passion).
3.  **The Result:** She explicitly states, ""for wherever that comes... I’m gone."" This establishes a mutually exclusive relationship between the two.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) Modesty and carnal love cannot survive together:** This directly reflects the climax and the ""condition"" set in the text. The fable's primary purpose is to explain why physical passion often displaces modesty.
*   **B) We must not require what is unreasonable:** The text doesn't focus on the unreasonableness of Jupiter's request, but rather on the specific terms of the agreement.
*   **C) Haste can lead to unwelcome outcomes:** While the story mentions haste (""Man was made in such a hurry""), this is merely the setup for the entry of Modesty, not the primary lesson.
*   **D) Do not unmodestly mock the sensitive feelings of old age...:** This is the moral for a different fable (""The Old Man and Death"" or similar). It has no relevance to this text.
*   **E) Virtues shared are virtues gained:** This contradicts the nature of Modesty in the story, who initially felt ""hardly dealt with"" by being turned loose among the multitude.

The central lesson is the incompatibility of modesty and carnal desire.

1.  **The Situation:** A monkey and a fox are traveling together. The monkey makes a grandiose claim about his heritage while passing a cemetery, claiming the dead people were once his ancestors' servants (freedmen).
2.  **The Context:** The monkey chooses a location—a cemetery—where the subjects of his claim are dead and physically unable to speak.
3.  **The Fox's Observation:** The fox points out the convenience of the monkey's lie. Because the dead cannot ""rise up and refute"" the claim, the monkey feels safe in his deception.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights how braggarts and liars often choose specific circumstances where their claims cannot be verified or challenged. They exploit the silence or the inability of others to prove them wrong.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Deceivers often exploit the inability of others to challenge their falsehoods.** This directly matches the fox's point about the dead being unable to refute the monkey.
*   **B)** This pertains to a different fable (*The Dog and the Shadow* or *The Two Friends*).
*   **C)** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific nuance of the monkey choosing a ""safe"" place to lie.
*   **D)** This is a general warning about the consequences of lying, but the monkey hasn't actually landed in ""deep water"" yet; he is being mocked for his cowardice.

1.  **The Action:** A Farmer shows compassion and kindness to a creature in distress (the frozen Snake) by warming it against his own body.
2.  **The Reaction:** Once the Snake is revived and healthy, it acts according to its ""natural instincts"" rather than showing appreciation for the life-saving act. It bites the Farmer.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Farmer dies, realizing too late that his kindness was misplaced because the nature of the recipient (a ""scoundrel"" or a predator) remained unchanged despite his help.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that some individuals (or creatures) remain true to their harmful nature regardless of the kindness shown to them. Gratitude cannot be expected from those who are inherently ungrateful or dangerous.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful:** This fits perfectly. No matter how great the Farmer's kindness was, it did not change the Snake's nature or make it feel obligated to act kindly in return.
*   **B) The man who treats others well is rewarded by gratitude:** The story proves the opposite.
*   **C) Gratitude prevents regret:** The Farmer feels regret precisely because there was no gratitude.
*   **D) Injuries may be regretfully forgiven, but not ungratefully forgotten:** This focuses on the victim's forgiveness, whereas the story focuses on the perpetrator's lack of appreciation.
*   **E) Even in the coldest times, a touch of compassion can revive what seems lost:** While true in a literal sense for the Snake, it misses the cautionary point of the fable (the danger of misplaced compassion).

1.  **The Situation**: The dog is surrounded by extreme noise (heavy hammers clanging) while the blacksmiths are working. Despite this chaos, which would normally wake or startle an animal, the dog chooses to remain asleep.
2.  **The Contrast**: As soon as the work stops and the sound of eating begins—a sound much quieter than a blacksmith's hammer—the dog wakes up and becomes attentive and friendly to his masters.
3.  **The Lesson**: The blacksmiths point out the hypocrisy/selective attention of the dog. He ignores the hard work (the hammers) because it doesn't directly involve his gain, but he is instantly alert to dinner (the chewing) because it represents a personal benefit.

**Evaluating the choices:**
*   **A**: This matches the story perfectly. The dog is ""inattentive"" to the hammers (non-beneficial labor) but quickly notices the chewing (personal benefit).
*   **B**: This refers to delegating actions, which is not present here.
*   **C**: While the story contrasts hard work with the dog's behavior, the specific focus is on the dog's selective perception, not necessarily a triumph of diligence over opportunism.
*   **D**: This is the moral for ""The Wolf and the Lamb,"" involving a tyrant and a victim.
*   **E**: The dog isn't harmonizing; he is being selective for his own stomach.

*   **A** captures the primary warning of the fable: The lion's ""humble and supplicating"" behavior was a ruse to disarm his enemy. The story serves as a cautionary tale about the danger of trusting a known adversary, even when they seem harmless.
*   **B** is incorrect; the story is about trust and treachery, not bragging.
*   **C** is a possible secondary lesson (""appearances deceive""), but ""trusting cautiously"" wouldn't have saved the unicorn—he needed to maintain his defense entirely.
*   **D** is a corruption of the Golden Rule and doesn't fit the instructive nature of a fable.
*   **E** represents the unicorn's perspective/argument in the final line, but it does not encompass the functional lesson of the story's outcome (the unicorn is still defeated/slain).

Fables involving natural enemies (like the lion and the unicorn) typically warn the reader to remain guarded against those with a history of enmity. Option A provides the most comprehensive lesson regarding the interaction between the two characters.

But being the ruler of the freshwater wasn't enough for him; he wanted to rule the sea too. With t",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Starting Point:** The Pike is already the ""Prince of the River,"" possessing size, beauty, and strength. He has a high status in his own domain.
2.  **The Conflict:** He becomes ""ambitious"" and decides that being the ruler of freshwater is ""not enough."" He attempts to expand his territory into the ocean (an environment for which he is not suited).
3.  **The Climax:** He encounters a Dolphin (a naturally superior power in that specific domain) and is nearly killed, being forced to flee back to his original home.
4.  **The Resolution:** The Pike learns to stay within his own territory, realizing that seeking more than his allotted domain led to disaster.

**Evaluating the Options:**
- **A) Be content with your lot:** This fits perfectly. The Pike had everything he needed in the river but risked it all for more, only to learn that he should have been satisfied with his original position.
- **B) Value is what others think of you:** The story focuses on the Pike’s internal ambition and physical struggle, not his reputation.
- **C) Strength without humility invites downfall:** While the Pike lacked humility, the specific resolution focuses more on **territory** and **satisfaction** with one's place rather than just personality traits.
- **D) Ambitious counsel without mighty help is useless:** The Pike acted alone; there was no ""counsel"" involved.
- **E) True leadership is not just about appearance:** The Pike actually was a strong leader in the river; his failure was about overreaching, not a lack of leadership ability.

The central lesson is that by overreaching and failing to be satisfied with his successful life in the river, the Pike nearly lost everything.

As soon as the ro,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the dialogue:

1.  **The Conflict:** Two soldiers are attacked by a robber.
2.  **The Action:** One soldier flees immediately (cowardice), while the other stays to fight (bravery).
3.  **The Aftermath:** Once the danger is over, the fleeing soldier returns, brandishing his weapon and bragging about how he would have handled the robber.
4.  **The Lesson:** The soldier who actually fought points out that the other's words are useless. He argues that the coward's display of ""courage"" after the fact cannot trick someone who has already seen his actions during the actual crisis.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Courage in words means nothing if you flee in danger:** This directly addresses the contrast between the soldier's hollow boasts and his actual behavior when the robber attacked. It highlights the hypocrisy of being ""brave"" only when it is safe to be so.
*   **B)** This is irrelevant to the plot; wealth is not mentioned.
*   **C)** While true, it is too broad and doesn't capture the specific irony of the coward's boasting.
*   **D)** The story focuses more on the unreliable *ally* than the enemy (robber).
*   **E)** While character is revealed in adversity, the specific point of the fable is the rejection of false bravery and empty words.

Option A most accurately reflects the ironic rebuke delivered at the end of the fable.

They resented the fact that the Hoopoe had been given a higher seat of honor than the other birds because the Hoopoe was notable for its ,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative elements:

1.  **The Conflict:** The birds are upset because the Hoopoe is given a ""higher seat of honor"" than they are. 
2.  **The Reason for the Honor:** The Hoopoe is honored because of its **outward appearance**—specifically its ""crown"" and its ""multicolored feathers.""
3.  **The Reality of the Character:** Despite its beautiful appearance, the story notes that the Hoopoe is ""accustomed to spend all its time rolling around in dung and filth."" This highlights a disconnect between the bird's external beauty and its actual habits/nature.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story critiques the decision to honor someone based purely on aesthetics or superficial symbols (the feathers and crown) when their actual behavior (living in filth) suggests they do not deserve that status.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) True worth should be measured by character and deeds, not by outward appearances:** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between the Hoopoe's feathers (appearance) and its behavior (deeds).
*   **B) It is very unwise... to provoke the least:** This is the moral of ""The Eagle and the Beetle,"" which doesn't apply here.
*   **C) Resentment tarnishes celebration:** While the birds are resentful, the story's focus is on the *reason* for the resentment—the unfair valuation of the Hoopoe.
*   **D) Notable kindness is never honored wasted:** There is no act of kindness depicted here.
*   **E) Inclusivity strengthens community bonds:** The story actually depicts a failure in social hierarchy and judgment, not a lesson on inclusivity.

The story teaches that superficial traits do not equate to true merit or value.

They w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the characters:

1.  **The Action:** A hen is nurturing snake eggs, treating them as her own offspring. She is acts out of a sense of care or duty, but she is essentially raising predators.
2.  **The Warning:** A swallow observes this and points out the hen's foolishness. The swallow explains that the creatures being raised are naturally dangerous and will eventually turn on the hen and others.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that some natures are inherently ""wicked"" or dangerous. No amount of kindness, devotion, or nurturing from the hen will change the fact that once the snakes hatch, they will act according to their nature and destroy their benefactor. 

Evaluating the options:
- **A** directly addresses the danger of trusting or nurturing something inherently ""wicked"" or dangerous.
- **B** refers to greed (Aesop's *The Dog and the Shadow*), not relevant here.
- **C** is the opposite of the story's outcome; devotion actually creates danger here.
- **D** refers to hubris or competition (Aesop's *The Frog and the Ox*), not relevant here.

The jackdaw, however, could not stand to live in human society, so w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the jackdaw's realization:

1.  **The Context:** A jackdaw is captured and kept as a pet (a ""slave in human society""). While it is fed and kept in a safe environment, it lacks freedom.
2.  **The Action:** The bird attempts to gain its freedom by escaping back to its natural environment.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because the bird is still dragging the string from its captivity, it becomes entangled in its own home and dies.
4.  **The Reflection:** The bird's dying words characterize its escape attempt as ""stupid"" because the pursuit of a specific ""condition"" (freedom/nature) over its previous ""condition"" (safety/captivity) led to its destruction.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) It is not the place, nor the condition, but the mind alone that is responsible for our happiness.** This aligns with the jackdaw's realization that its inability to accept its situation led to a fatal decision. The bird's mental state—its refusal to endure its condition—resulted in its death.
*   **B)** Irrelevant; there are no tears in the story.
*   **C)** Irrelevant; the ""generosity"" of the children letting it loose for a moment led to the bird's death, not its salvation.
*   **D)** While the children were innocent, the story focuses on the bird's internal choice and the tragic irony of its ""freedom.""
*   **E)** This is a theme within the story, but the fable concludes with the bird's regret over the *consequences* of its escape, rather than a lecture on the nature of the gift.

The moral most commonly associated with this Aesop's fable (""The Jackdaw and the String"") is that seeking to change one's condition without considering the risks can lead to even greater misfortune, or that our internal perspective dictates our fate. Option A captures the philosophical root of the bird's tragic error.

'Be careful, my friends,' he said, 'what if we all drown before the me",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict**: Sailors are in a life-threatening storm and are attempting to seek divine intervention.
2.  **The Complication**: They are praying to ""middlemen"" (various saints). The protagonist points out that this adds a layer of bureaucracy/delay; the saints have to deliver the message to the high power.
3.  **The Solution**: The protagonist suggests cutting out the intermediaries and going directly to the source of power (God) to save time and ensure the request is heard immediately.
4.  **The Result**: By taking the direct route, they are saved.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) The shortest and surest way of doing things is best.** This directly reflects the sailor's logic: going straight to the top is more efficient and reliable than using intermediaries during a crisis.
*   **B) It is better to be loved than feared.** This is a common Machiavellian theme but has no relevance to this story.
*   **C) Mercy tempers power.** While the wind calms, the focus of the story is on the *method* of the prayer, not the nature of the deity's mercy.
*   **D) Not all pragmatic advice is diverse or wise.** This contradicts the story, as the sailor’s pragmatic advice proved to be effective.
*   **E) Urgency in communication is vital.** While urgency is a factor, the story specifically highlights the ""way"" or ""pathway"" of communication (directness) rather than just the speed of the message itself.

The fable teaches that when a task is urgent or important, one should go directly to the person in charge rather than relying on intermediaries. This matches the classic moral associated with this fable (often attributed to Aesop or found in similar collections).

1.  **The Context:** Two predators (the snake and the weasel) are in a state of conflict with each other.
2.  **The Mistake:** The mice (the weaker party/prey) perceive this conflict as an opportunity for safety or celebration and leave their protective holes.
3.  **The Outcome:** The two powerful rivals immediately set aside their differences to prey upon the vulnerable bystanders.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **B, C, and E** do not fit the specific actions of the characters.
*   **D** is a variation of a different fable's moral (often linked to the ""Boar and the Fox"") regarding preparedness.
*   **A** captures the essence of the warning: When powerful enemies are fighting, the vulnerable (bystanders) should not assume they are safe or take advantage of the situation, as the powerful may unite against a common, easier target. In many classical translations of Aesop (where this fable originates), the moral is specifically that those who get involved in the quarrels of the powerful often find themselves the ultimate victims.

The mice's decision to emerge during the conflict led to their demise because the ""powerful parties"" (the predators) found a common interest in hunting them.

'Well!' said the Boy, 'you'll regret it, because you'll never be as well cared for any",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the situation:

1.  **The Situation:** A bird (the Goldfinch) has escaped a life of security and comfort provided by a human (the Master/Boy).
2.  **The Master's Argument:** The Boy argues that the bird is making a mistake because it will lose the luxury and care it received in captivity (""you'll never be as well cared for anywhere else"").
3.  **The Bird's Rebuttal:** The bird acknowledges that life outside might be harder or less comfortable, but explicitly states that personal autonomy and independence are more valuable than provided comfort (""I would rather take care of myself than be under your care"").

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) There is no wealth greater than liberty:** This aligns perfectly with the bird's sentiment. The ""wealth"" of being cared for is inferior to the ""liberty"" of self-reliance.
*   **B) You should not treat bad people the same way...:** This is irrelevant to the story's themes.
*   **C) Defiance can mask true concern:** This misinterprets the Master's warning and the bird's response.
*   **D) Changing your independent location...:** This focuses on a ""state of mind"" rather than the trade-off between security and freedom.
*   **E) Freedom is a treasure worth pursuing, even at great risk:** While close, the story focuses more on the *comparative value* of liberty versus comfort/wealth rather than the element of ""risk"" or the ""pursuit"" itself.

The core of the fable is the assertion that being free is better than being a well-fed prisoner. This matches the classic Aesopic sentiment that liberty is the greatest treasure.

The mole said to them, 'Silence your complaining, since you can see that I am deprived of eyes.'",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the characters and their dialogue step by step:

1.  **The Donkey and the Monkey:** Both characters are complaining about lacking ""cosmetic"" or non-essential features (horns and a tail). While these features might be desirable to them, their absence does not fundamentally impair their ability to function or navigate the world.
2.  **The Mole:** The mole interjects to point out a much more significant deprivation: the lack of sight (""I am deprived of eyes"").
3.  **The Interaction:** The mole’s statement serves to put the complaints of the donkey and the monkey into perspective. By comparing their minor grievances (lack of horns/tail) to a major disability (blindness), the mole suggests that they should be grateful for what they have rather than bitter about what they lack.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. It suggests that personal misfortunes seem smaller and more bearable when compared to the greater sufferings or deprivations of others.
*   **B:** This is the moral typically associated with ""The Donkey and the Horse,"" regarding shared burdens.
*   **C:** While true, it doesn't capture the comparative element of the mole's intervention.
*   **D:** This is nonsensical in the context of the story.
*   **E:** The donkey and monkey aren't necessarily coveting; they are complaining about their own physical traits. The mole isn't speaking about ""unique gifts,"" but rather a more severe lack.

The story teaches that perspective is the cure for self-pity. By looking at those who are worse off, our own problems seem less significant.

The soup fell out of the long bill of the Cra",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The Fox plays a trick on the Crane by serving food in a way that is impossible for the Crane to eat (a flat dish), purely for the Fox's own amusement. This is an act of inconsiderate and selfish ""hospitality.""
2.  **The Crane's Response:** Instead of arguing, the Crane replicates the Fox's behavior by serving food in a vessel (a narrow-mouthed flagon) that the Fox cannot access, while the Crane can. 
3.  **The Result:** The Fox experiences the same frustration she inflicted on the Crane. The text describes this as a ""fitting requital"" (repayment).

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Do unto others what you would have them do unto you:** This is the ""Golden Rule."" The story serves as a cautionary tale of what happens when you *ignore* this rule. Because the Fox did something unkind, she received unkindness in return.
*   **B) Beware the sort of person who uses tricks:** While true, this is a warning for the victim, whereas the story focuses on the reciprocity between the two characters.
*   **C) Cleverness can outwit vexation:** This focuses only on the Crane's revenge, missing the broader lesson about social conduct.
*   **D) A clever alliance with the powerless is futile:** Irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) Consideration for others' needs fosters true hospitality:** While implied, the story is specifically about the *consequences* of bad behavior (the ""tit-for-tat"" nature of the interaction).

The traditional moral associated with Aesop's ""The Fox and the Stork (or Crane)"" is that if you treat others poorly, you should expect to be treated poorly in return. This aligns most closely with the principle of the Golden Rule (Option A).

1.  **The Situation:** A wife is disliked by everyone in her husband's house. To test if it is her behavior or the environment causing the issue, the husband sends her to her father’s house.
2.  **The Evidence:** Upon her return, she complains that even the shepherds and herdsmen—who are out in the fields from dawn until dusk and barely see her—treated her with aversion.
3.  **The Husband’s Conclusion:** He reasons that if people who barely interacted with her (the ""straws"" or minor indicators) disliked her, then those who had to spend the whole day with her must have found her unbearable.
4.  **The Logic:** Small signs or interactions (how the shepherds looked at her) reveal the truth about a larger situation (her overall character and how she treats everyone).

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) Straws show how the wind blows:** This is a classic idiom meaning that small signs or insignificant events can indicate a larger trend or the general state of affairs. This perfectly matches the husband's logic: the shepherds' reactions were the ""straws"" indicating the ""wind"" of her generally disagreeable personality.
*   **B), C), D), E):** While some of these mention themes like ""disapproval"" or ""home,"" they do not capture the deductive reasoning (the lesson of the story) regarding how small indicators reveal a larger truth.

1.  **The Event:** A wheel on a coach is creaking (complaining/making noise).
2.  **The Observation:** The coachman notices that it is the ""worst wheel of the whole set.""
3.  **The Irony:** The wheel that is doing the least amount of work or is in the worst condition is the one making the most noise.

In literature and fables (similar to Aesop's ""The Creaking Wheels""), the ""creaking wheel"" represents those who complain the loudest despite contributing the least or being the most deficient. Usually, the wheels doing the most work bear the burden in silence, while the weak or failing part demands the most attention through noise.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) Complaining is the privilege of the weak:** This aligns with the observation that the ""worst"" wheel is the one creaking. It suggests that those who contribute the least or are in the worst state are often the most vocal.
*   **B, C, D:** These do not relate to the specific interaction between the quality of the wheel and the noise it makes.
*   **E) Noise often masks vulnerability:** While plausible, the fable focuses more on the *audacity* of the weak to complain rather than a strategic mask.

Historically, this specific fable (often attributed to the likes of Abstemius or found in older collections) concludes that those who are most burdensome or least capable are often the loudest complainers.

The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, 'I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you'd gone right",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this fable (which belongs to a tradition of Sybaritic tales often attributed to Aesop), let’s analyze the narrative:

1.  **The Event:** A woman breaks a jar—a practical problem requiring a practical solution (repair/patching).
2.  **The Reaction:** Instead of addressing the physical damage, the jar (personified) focuses on seeking justice and legal retribution by finding a witness for a lawsuit.
3.  **The Lesson:** The woman points out that seeking a ""court-case"" (argument/litigation) is a waste of time compared to getting a ""bandage"" (direct action/repair). While the jar is busy proving who is right or seeking a legal remedy, the physical damage remains unaddressed.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Action is more valuable than arguments:** This fits perfectly. It contrasts the uselessness of a legal dispute (arguments) with the practical necessity of a bandage (action).
*   **B) You can't please everybody:** There is no attempt to please anyone in the story.
*   **C) Practicality triumphs over sarcasm:** While the woman is being sarcastic, her point is that the jar should have been practical. However, the core moral of these types of fables is usually about prioritizing work/repair over litigation.
*   **D) Practical fortune...:** This is overly complex and does not fit the simple cautionary nature of the tale.
*   **E) Small actions reveal hidden strengths:** The story is about a failure of priority, not hidden strengths.

The fable critiques those who prioritize litigation and rhetoric over practical solutions to their problems.

When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable ""The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat,"" let's analyze the narrative elements:

1.  **The Characters:** On one side, we have Dolphins and Whales—large, powerful, and majestic sea creatures. On the other side, we have a Sprat—a very small, insignificant fish.
2.  **The Conflict:** The large creatures are engaged in a ""fierce war.""
3.  **The Dialogue:** The Sprat offers to mediate (act as an umpire) to stop the path to destruction.
4.  **The Rejection:** The Dolphin's response is the key to the moral. He states that they would rather die fighting a worthy opponent than allow an insignificant creature like a Sprat to interfere or mediate their business.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A) Some would rather fight than not:** Too broad; it doesn't account for the rejection of the mediator based on status.
- **B) Those who adapt to the times will emerge unscathed:** Irrelevant to the story.
- **C) Pride often leads to unnecessary conflict:** This is the core theme. The Dolphin’s pride is so great that he views the Sprat's help as an insult. The ""fierce man"" (or creature) considers his dignity more important than his safety, choosing a noble death over an ""ignoble"" peace mediated by an inferior. 
- **D) Every fierce, proud man for himself:** While pride is mentioned, this doesn't capture the essence of rejecting outside interference.
- **E) Conflict among kin can lead to mutual ruin:** While true that they are fighting, the story focuses specifically on the interaction with the ""umpire.""

The traditional moral associated with this Aesop's fable is that ""conceited persons, when they think they are of no account, much prefer to perish in a general ruin rather than to be spared by the mediation of their inferiors."" This aligns most closely with the themes of pride and the rejection of help from those deemed beneath them.

One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them. When th",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** The Man and the Satyr are attempting to form an alliance or friendship. In fables, these scenarios usually test the character or integrity of the participants.
2.  **The Incident:** The Satyr observes the Man performing the same physical action (blowing breath) for two diametrically opposed purposes: once to provide heat (warm his hands) and once to remove heat (cool his food).
3.  **The Satyr's Reaction:** The Satyr perceives this as a sign of inconsistency or double-dealing. To him, someone who can produce two opposite effects from the same source is untrustworthy or ""double-tongued.""
4.  **The Idiom:** This fable is the origin of the expression ""to blow hot and cold,"" which describes someone who is inconsistent, indecisive, or two-faced—supporting one side and then the other depending on the situation.
5.  **Evaluating Options:**
    *   **A:** Directly addresses the Satyr's conclusion that a person who uses the same ""breath"" (or words/actions) to serve two opposing ends cannot be trusted.
    *   **B:** Irrelevant to the story's events.
    *   **C:** While the Man is being ""adaptable"" in a physical sense, the Satyr views this as a character flaw, making this an unlikely moral for a fable of this type.
    *   **D:** Too complex and philosophical for the specific actions described.
    *   **E:** This is a general truth, but doesn't capture the specific ""doubleness"" that the Satyr objects to.

The traditional moral of Aesop's ""The Man and the Satyr"" is that those who are inconsistent or who can argue for both sides of an issue with equal facility are not reliable friends.

morables_173,"Socrates had erected for himself a very modest house - and I myself would even be willing to die as Socrates died if I could achieve an equal fame, yes, I would be willing to suffer the same public di",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** The story describes Socrates building a very small, modest house.
2.  **The Conflict:** A neighbor questions why a man of Socrates' stature would have such a tiny dwelling, implying that it is insufficient or beneath him.
3.  **The Resolution (The Punchline):** Socrates responds, ""if only I could fill it with true friends!"" 
4.  **The Implication:** Socrates is suggesting that even though the house is tiny, ""true friends"" are so rare and difficult to come by that he likely wouldn't even be able to fill that small space with them. 

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) True friends are hard to find:** This directly aligns with Socrates’ statement. The ""tiny"" house is still too large for the number of genuine friends one can expect to have.
*   **B) No curse weighs more heavily than a guilty conscience:** This relates to morality but has nothing to do with the specific dialogue about the house or friendship.
*   **C) Curiosity fuels wisdom:** While the neighbor is curious, the focus is on Socrates' witty retort regarding human relationships, not the pursuit of knowledge.
*   **D) Do not play the modest... wise man after the fact:** This is a criticism of the narrator's preamble, not the moral of the fable itself.
*   **E) True greatness often requires enduring present hardships...:** While the narrator mentions Socrates' death and fame, the core of the specific fable (the house and the dialogue) is about the scarcity of friendship.

The story is a classic fable by Phaedrus (Book 3, Fable 9), and its traditional moral is that genuine friendship is rare.

Admittedly, Prometheus had made the lion very large and handsome, supplying him with sharp fangs in his jaw and arming him w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative progression:

1.  **The Lion’s dissatisfaction:** Despite being the most powerful and handsome animal created by Prometheus, the lion is obsessed with his one perceived flaw: his fear of roosters.
2.  **The Lion’s despair:** He is so ashamed of this single weakness that he feels his life is not worth living and contemplates death.
3.  **The Encounter with the Elephant:** The lion meets the elephant—another massive, powerful creature—and notices the elephant is terrified of something much smaller: a gnat.
4.  **The Realization:** Once the lion sees that the elephant has a similar (and arguably more embarrassing) struggle, he gains perspective. He realizes that his situation is actually quite good compared to others.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) There is always someone else worse off than you:** This aligns with the lion's conclusion. He realizes he is in ""better shape"" than the elephant because a rooster is more formidable than a gnat. He ceases his self-pity after seeing another's struggle.
*   **B) No matter how you brag, you can be undone:** The lion wasn't bragging; he was self-loathing.
*   **C) Strength alone does not guarantee invulnerability:** While true in the story, the *lesson* the lion learns (the moral) focuses on his shift from despair to self-acceptance through comparison.
*   **D) You may share the labours...:** This is a moral for a different fable (usually involving a hunting party).
*   **E) Even divine gifts can spark envy:** This does not fit the narrative arc.

The fable teaches that when we focus on our own flaws, we often despair, but gain perspective when we realize that everyone—even the most powerful—has their own burdens and weaknesses.

morables_169,"The crow was making a sacrifice to Athena and invited a dog to the feast. The dog said to her, 'Why do you foolishly squander these sacrifices? The goddess clearly hates you so much that she has taken",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue between the crow and the dog:

1.  **The Context:** The crow is performing a sacrifice to Athena, the goddess of wisdom. In Greek mythology, crows were once messengers for Athena but were famously dismissed or punished, leading to their reputation as omens of ill fortune or lack of credibility.
2.  **The Dog's Skepticism:** The dog points out that the sacrifice is a waste (""squander"") because Athena has already shown her dislike for the crow by stripping it of its credibility. The dog suggests there is no point in trying to please someone who clearly hates you.
3.  **The Crow's Logic:** The crow explains that the exact reason it is sacrificing is *because* the relationship is bad. The crow is attempting to appease an enemy or a hostile power in hopes of changing that entity's disposition to gain favor or restore its status.

**Evaluating the options:**
- **B, C, and E** do not fit the cynical or pragmatic nature of the crow’s bribe-like sacrifice.
- **D** contradicts the story, as the crow is attempting something *because* it lacks the ""means"" (credibility) and is hoping for a supernatural change.
- **A** captures the essence of the crow's behavior: performing a ritual or being ""generous"" to a hostile party (Athena) specifically to manipulate an outcome or curry favor.

In many classical collections of Aesop's fables (Perry Index 212), this story is used to illustrate how people will go to great lengths to appease those who dislike them or have power over them, often out of self-interest.

morables_418,"They say that the hyena has a double nature: for a period of time the hyena is male, and then later on she is female. The story goes that when a male hyena was treating a female badly, she said to him",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"In this fable, attributed to Aesop, the core lesson centers on the reversal of roles and the consequences of mistreating others when you are in a position of power.

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1.  **The Premise:** The fable relies on an ancient (and biologically incorrect) belief that the hyena changes sex periodically. This creates a cycle where the ""oppressor"" and the ""oppressed"" inevitably switch places.
2.  **The Conflict:** The male hyena treats the female badly because he is currently in the dominant or ""male"" role.
3.  **The Warning:** The female reminds him that the hierarchy is temporary. Soon, she will be the male and he will be the female. She is essentially saying, ""Treat me well now, because I will soon be in the position you are in now, with the power to treat you the same way.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story warns those in power (or those who judge/rule) to behave justly because fortunes change, and today's subordinate may be tomorrow's superior. 

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** This aligns with the idea of a reversal of status where a person who was once ""judged"" or subordinate gains the power to ""judge"" their former superior.
*   **B, C, E:** These do not fit the specific context of the role reversal described in the dialogue.
*   **D:** While the hyena is ""double-natured,"" the moral of the story isn't about the *mistrust* of the character, but rather a warning about the *consequence of one's actions* given that positions change.

In many classical translations of Aesop's fables, the moral associated with the Hyena is that if you are in office or power, you should not mistreat your subordinates, as you may find yourself under their authority later. Option A is the closest fit to this concept of shifting hierarchies.

The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Premise:** The lion and the dolphin form an alliance based on their status as ""kings"" of their respective domains (land and sea). They assume that because they are both powerful, they are ideal partners.
2.  **The Conflict:** The lion faces a practical problem (a war with a bull) and calls upon his ally for help.
3.  **The Failure:** The dolphin has the *will* to help, but lacks the *capacity* because his nature dictates that he must remain in the water. He cannot physically assist the lion on land.
4.  **The Lesson:** The lion feels betrayed, but the dolphin points out that his inability to help is a matter of nature, not character. The alliance failed because it was based on shared prestige rather than practical utility.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A)** Directly addresses the core issue: When choosing allies, one must consider whether they have the physical or practical ability to provide aid during a crisis.
- **B)** Incorrect; the dolphin did not *want* or *intend* to betray the lion; he was simply physically unable to help.
- **C)** This describes a plot point but isn't the overarching moral.
- **D)** This is a motivational sentiment that doesn't reflect the story's outcome.
- **E)** While true, it is less specific than **A**. This fable is a classic warning about choosing allies whose abilities align with the needs of the partnership.

In the tradition of Aesop's fables, this specific story (*The Lion and the Dolphin*) is meant to teach us to choose allies who can actually stand by us in the ""peril"" of our specific environment.

1.  **The Situation:** The fox tries to trick the cicada into coming down from the safety of a tree by using flattery.
2.  **The Response:** The cicada tests the fox by dropping a leaf, confirming the fox's predatory intent when the fox pounces on it.
3.  **The Reason:** The cicada explains he is cautious because he has seen evidence (wings in a fox's droppings/spoor) that other cicadas have been eaten by foxes.

**Analysis of the choices:**
*   **B** and **C** are not supported by the specific narrative details of this story.
*   **D** describes a ""self-fulfilling prophecy,"" which is the opposite of what happens here (the cicada successfully avoids his fate).
*   **E** is a possible observation, but it doesn't capture the wisdom of the protagonist.
*   **A** directly reflects the end of the story. The cicada is ""discerning"" and ""wise"" because he observed the remains of his ""neighbors"" (other cicadas) and used that knowledge to protect himself. This is a classic Aesop's moral: learning from the misfortunes of others allows one to avoid a similar fate.

The cicada’s survival is based entirely on his observation of what happened to those who came before him.

The Wolf, who lay lurking just by, heard this",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Command:** The mother Goat warns her Kid to be cautious and not open the door to anyone, establishing the theme of vigilance.
2.  **The Deception:** The Wolf attempts to use hypocrisy (counterfeiting/imitating the Goat's voice) to trick the Kid into opening the door. He pretends to be something he is not to gain entry.
3.  **The Revelation:** The Kid is observant. Despite the auditory disguise (the voice), the visual evidence (the Wolf's appearance) reveals the truth.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Kid identifies the ""cheat"" (the hypocrite). The story demonstrates that while a predator or deceiver may try to mimic a virtuous or familiar person, their true identity or ""wolfish"" nature will eventually expose them to a cautious observer.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) A hypocrite can usually be found out.** This directly aligns with the Wolf being caught in his disguise by the Kid's careful observation.
*   **B) and C)** involve ""demise"" or ""caring hearts,"" which are themes not explicitly developed in this short fable.
*   **D)** refers to ""cowards,"" but the Kid is portrayed as wise and cautious, not necessarily a coward.
*   **E)** refers to ""neglecting oversight,"" but the mother Goat actually provided excellent oversight and instructions.

In many classic editions of Aesop's Fables, this specific story (The Kid and the Wolf) is used to illustrate that those who pretend to be what they are not (hypocrites) will be revealed by their true nature or appearances.

morables_157,"A creeping snake who had been stepped on by many people made his way to the temple of Apollo and went inside. Apollo immediately explained to the snake, 'If you had simply killed the first person who ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this fable (often attributed to Aesop), let’s look at the logic of Apollo's advice to the snake:

1.  **The Situation:** A snake is constantly being stepped on because it allows people to mistreat it without consequence.
2.  **Apollo’s Advice:** If the snake had retaliated against the very first person who stepped on it, word would have spread that the snake is dangerous. This initial act of punishment would have served as a deterrent to everyone else.
3.  **The Lesson:** The core idea is about **deterrence**. By making an example of the first offender, potential future offenders are discouraged from committing the same act.

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) If people who have previously committed a crime are swiftly punished, then others will become afraid on their account.** This aligns perfectly with the idea of deterrence shown in the story.
*   **B) Wicked people commit crime in haste...** This is about delayed justice, which isn't the focus here.
*   **C) Immediate actions often lack depth.** The story actually advocates for immediate action (retaliating against the first person).
*   **D) Where creeping force is not enough...** This relates to cleverness over force, but the story is more about the *timing* and *reputation* of retaliation rather than being ""clever"" versus ""strong.""
*   **E) Seeking refuge...** The snake went to the temple for advice/refuge, but the lesson Apollo gave was about his past behavior on the road.

The fable teaches that those who do not defend themselves against the first injury become constant victims, and that swift punishment of one serves as a warning to all.

'I would agree,' the lion said, 'if you were not already in the habit of taking what",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions between the lion and the two characters:

1.  **The Robber:** He approaches with a sense of entitlement and a history of taking things by force (""the habit of taking whatever you want""). The lion refuses him because his aggressive and ""villainous"" nature does not deserve a reward.
2.  **The Wayfarer:** He approaches with humility and caution, not feeling entitled to the kill. He even backs away to show respect for the lion's strength and ownership.
3.  **The Lion's Reaction:** The lion rewards the wayfarer's ""modesty"" and lack of aggression. He goes so far as to divide the kill and leave so the man can take it without fear.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between the robber (force/resistance) and the wayfarer (humility/generosity).
*   **B)** This focuses on betrayal, which is not the primary theme here (the robber wasn't necessarily a traitor, just a thief).
*   **C)** While the lion acts kindly, the story is more about the character of those seeking the prize than the ""taming"" of the lion itself.
*   **D)** The villain's cunning did not outwit anyone; he was simply rejected.
*   **E)** While the robber was entitled, the story's climax is the positive reward for the modest man, making A a more complete lesson.

1.  **Identify the central characters and actions**: A man is excessively donating his money to a shrine (an act of ""piety"" that borders on financial irresponsibility).
2.  **Identify the conflict**: The man is spending so much that he is at risk of becoming poor.
3.  **Identify the turn/message**: The god appears specifically to warn the man *not* to blame the deity once the man's own actions lead to his financial ruin.
4.  **Evaluate the options**:
    *   **A**: This directly addresses the god's warning. The man's foolishness (overspending) will lead to misfortune (poverty), and the god anticipates that the man will shift the blame onto him.
    *   **B**: There is no mention of broken promises in the text.
    *   **C**: While extravagance is present, the story isn't about counsel being ignored; it's about the deflection of responsibility.
    *   **D**: The man does not seem to be seeking profit; he seems to be seeking favor or acting out of misguided devotion.
    *   **E**: While this is a common trope in fables, the specific punchline of this story is about the **blame** that follows self-inflicted hardship.

The god's dialogue—""if you spend everything... you'll put the blame on me""—is the definitive key to the moral.

When he saw the reflection of his body in the water, he disparaged the slenderness of his legs but revelled in the shape and",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Conflict of Values:** The stag evaluates his own body parts based on aesthetics. He views his slender legs as a defect (""disparaged"") and his large antlers as a source of pride and beauty (""revelled"").
2.  **The Survival Test:** When the hunters appear, the stag’s physical attributes are put to a practical test. His thin legs, which he hated, provide the speed necessary to outrun his pursuers and reach safety.
3.  **The Downfall:** The antlers, which he prized for their appearance, physically entangle him in the branches, leading directly to his capture and death.
4.  **The Realization:** In his final moments, the stag explicitly states the lesson: ""The thing that I disparaged could have saved me while I have been destroyed by the very thing I boasted about.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) What is most truly valuable is often underrated.** This encapsulates the stag's error. He underrated his legs (the truly valuable tool for survival) while overestimating the value of his horns. This is a classic interpretation of this Aesop fable.
*   **B) It is often the case that people are greedy for things which they think will bring them honour...** While the stag liked his horns for the ""honor"" or status of their appearance, the word ""greedy"" doesn't quite fit his behavior in the story.
*   **C) Persistence outshines vanity.** The story isn't about the hunters' persistence, but about the stag's physical attributes.
*   **D) Vain deceivers...** There are no deceivers in this story.
*   **E) Pride in appearances can blind us to our true strengths.** This is very close, but the fable's traditional moral usually focuses on the irony of utility versus beauty—the idea that we often despise what is useful and admire what is harmful.

Option A most accurately reflects the ironic reversal presented in the stag's lament: that the ""ugly"" but functional legs were his salvation, while his ""beautiful"" but useless horns were his undoing.

Furious at ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Eagle ignores the Beetle’s plea and disrespects her by knocking her aside to kill the Hare.
2.  **The Retaliation:** Despite being significantly smaller and ""weaker"" than the Eagle, the Beetle systematically destroys the Eagle's eggs, even when the Eagle seeks protection from the highest authority (Jupiter).
3.  **The Resolution:** Jupiter recognizes that the Beetle was justified in her revenge because the Eagle had wronged her.
4.  **The Theme:** The story centers on the idea that no matter how small or insignificant someone may seem, they have the capacity to strike back against a more powerful oppressor who has mistreated them.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) The weak may find a way to avenge a wrong:** This aligns perfectly with the Beetle's actions against the much larger Eagle.
*   **B) Greed and honor:** The story is about revenge and justice, not greed for honor.
*   **C) Power in restraint:** While the Eagle lacked restraint, the core of the story is the Beetle's successful vengeance.
*   **D) Beauty and leadership:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) Compassion:** The story is actually a cycle of lack of compassion and subsequent destruction, ending in an uneasy truce rather than a bridge between species.

The moral is a classic Aesop lesson: even the most powerful cannot afford to mistreat the weak, for the weak will find a way to retaliate.

At a certain m",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the progression of events:

1.  **The First Event:** An accident occurs where the donkey falls into a stream, the salt dissolves, and the burden is lightened. This introduces the idea that a ""trick"" can provide a benefit.
2.  **The Second Event:** The donkey attempts to repeat the benefit by falling on purpose (deception). It works once, but the merchant becomes ""observant"" and realizes he is being tricked.
3.  **The Third Event:** The merchant prepares a counter-measure (sponges). Because the donkey tries to play the same trick again, he ends up with a burden twice as heavy.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) You can fool someone only so many times:** This fits the narrative perfectly. The donkey successfully ""fooled"" the merchant once with a fake accident, but the merchant caught on and turned the trick against him. It highlights that deceit is eventually discovered and punished.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you...:** This is irrelevant to the plot of the story.
*   **C) Cunning minds see wicked traps:** While the merchant was cunning, the story is primarily a warning to the donkey (the perpetrator of the trick) rather than a praise of the merchant.
*   **D) Everyone should be satisfied...:** This is overly complex and uses ""observant disaster"" awkwardly; it doesn't quite capture the cause-and-effect of the donkey's dishonesty.
*   **E) Sometimes, accidents can lighten the load...:** This is a literal observation of the first paragraph but fails to address the lesson learned from the donkey's subsequent failure and the merchant's reaction.

The core lesson of Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Salt Merchant and His Donkey"") is that the same trick will not work forever, and dishonesty often brings its own punishment when the victim catches on.

Even after stroking the animal he was not sure of its i,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Character's Ability:** The protagonist is a blind man who relies on touch and intuition rather than sight. He is skilled at identifying the nature of creatures through tactile examination.
2.  **The Situation:** He is presented with a wolf cub. Even though the cub is young and likely small, soft, and perhaps seemingly harmless (much like a fox or a puppy), the man senses an inherent nature within it.
3.  **The Climax/Observation:** The man admits he cannot pinpoint the exact species, but he identifies the most crucial trait: the animal's inherent danger to a flock of sheep.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story suggests that even when an individual is young and hasn't yet committed an act of harm, their innate character or ""evil tendencies"" are already present and recognizable to those with discernment. It reflects the idea that nature often precedes action.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Evil tendencies are shown in early life:** This aligns perfectly with the man identifying the danger in a *cub* before it has grown into a full predator.
*   **B) Harsh means:** There is no mention of punishment or harsh treatment in the text.
*   **C) Appearances can be misleading:** While true, the man is literally blind; he is looking past physical form to the ""nature"" of the beast.
*   **D) Reward/Punish:** Not relevant to the plot.
*   **E) Familiar may conceal truth:** The wolf is not necessarily ""familiar"" in a comforting sense here; the focus is on its inherent predatory nature from birth.

This fable is traditionally attributed to Aesop, and the classical moral associated with it is that a person's (or animal's) wicked nature is apparent from their youth.

morables_694,"There was a generous Rich Man who always had a grand and open table, so he never lacked guests. This man noticed that all sorts of people came to him, and he became curious to see who were true friend",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"The story describes a man who uses a test to distinguish between those who enjoy his wealth (freeloaders) and those who are truly loyal. Out of a ""full table"" of many guests, only two remained when there was a perceived risk or a request for personal sacrifice.

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1. **The Context:** The Rich Man is generous and surrounded by many people, but he suspects their motives.
2. **The Conflict:** He introduces a scenario involving a ""quarrel"" and the need for physical support (""swords in hand""), which implies danger and effort.
3. **The Result:** The vast majority (""the rest"") prioritized their own safety/convenience and made excuses, revealing their lack of genuine bond.
4. **The Conclusion:** The story explicitly states he found only two friends among the crowd, emphasizing that while ""hangers-on"" are plentiful, those who stand by you in times of trouble are rare.

While several options touch on themes of the story (like generosity or excuses), the core lesson remains the classic observation that a large number of acquaintances does not equate to a large number of friends. True loyalty is tested by adversity and is found in very few people.

morables_107,"A River carried down in its stream two Pots, one made of earthenware and the other of brass. The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, 'Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch m",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dynamics between the characters:

1.  **The Characters:** There are two pots, one made of fragile earthenware and one made of strong brass. 
2.  **The Situation:** They are both being carried by the same river (life/circumstances).
3.  **The Interaction:** The Earthen Pot recognizes that despite their shared journey, they are not alike in strength. A collision that would not harm the Brass Pot would be fatal to the Earthen Pot.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Earthen Pot understands that it is dangerous to be too close to someone much ""harder"" or more powerful, as the disparity in their natures makes the relationship inherently risky for the weaker party. Historically, this Aesop's fable concludes that true security and friendship are found among those of similar status, strength, or ""material,"" because an accidental ""nudge"" from a powerful person can destroy a fragile one.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Equals make the best friends:** This aligns with the classic moral of this fable (often phrased as ""The strong and the weak cannot keep company"" or ""Avoid the powerful""). It highlights that disparity in power leads to danger for the weaker party.
*   **B) Do not overestimate your worth:** The Earthen Pot is actually being very realistic about its worth/fragility, not overestimating it.
*   **C & E)** These are modern, ""self-help"" interpretations that focus on intrinsic value, whereas traditional fables focus on practical survival and social dynamics.
*   **D)** This is a garbled variation of a different sentiment.

**Conclusion:** The fable teaches that partnerships are safest and most successful between equals.

The wild boar replied, 'I have",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions and dialogue of the characters:

1.  **The Action:** The wild boar is sharpening his tusks (preparing his weapons/defenses) during a time of peace or quiet (""no immediate need"").
2.  **The Rationale:** The boar explains that when danger actually arrives, it will be too late to start preparing. He needs his defenses ready for immediate use to ensure his safety.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story emphasizes the importance of being prepared for future trouble before it arrives. 

Now, let's look at the options:
*   **A) Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace.** (This aligns with the theme of preparing defenses in advance to be ready for conflict.)
*   **B) God is the ultimate judge.** (Irrelevant to the text.)
*   **C) Curiosity must be guided by prudence.** (Focuses on the fox, but the boar is the one providing the lesson.)
*   **D) Prudent men feel worst when they contribute to their own inquisitive undoing.** (Irrelevant to the outcome.)
*   **E) Even nature prepares its own defenses.** (While true, the fable is traditionally used as a metaphor for human foresight and readiness for conflict/adversity.)

Option A is the classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable (""The Wild Boar and the Fox""). It teaches that we should prepare for danger during times of safety.

morables_414,"A certain man took a deposit from a friend but intended to keep it for himself. When the depositor then summoned him to swear an oath regarding the deposit, he realized the danger he was in and prepar",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the dialogue:

1.  **The Fraud:** a man intends to steal a deposit and plans to swear a false oath to get away with it.
2.  **The False Security:** The man meets the god ""Oath,"" who tells him he usually only returns to cities every thirty or forty years. This gives the man a false sense of security, leading him to believe he won't be punished for a long time.
3.  **The Punishment:** The man commits perjury the very next day, but contrary to the ""thirty-year"" rule, Oath returns immediately to punish him.
4.  **The Lesson:** Oath explains that while he may take a long time to return for some, he can return the very same day for those who deliberately provoke or mock him.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This matches the story perfectly. The man tried to calculate a specific timeline for his punishment based on the god's general habits, but discovered that divine justice is unpredictable and can strike at any time.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there is no comparison between a single man and a crowd.
*   **C:** While the man's fear led him to ask questions, the core of the story is about the timing of justice, not the distortion of truth through fear.
*   **D:** This refers to the nature of strife and does not fit the context of perjury and divine punishment.
*   **E:** While the man is stealing, the focus of the climax is specifically onto the ""Oath"" and the timing of his retribution, not the weight of a conscience (the man seems to have no conscience, only a fear of being caught).

The fable is one of Aesop's (often numbered 170 in the Perry Index), and its traditional moral is that the timing of divine retribution is unpredictable.

morables_66,"A Lark had made her nest in the early spring on the young green wheat. The brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their feathers, whe",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the progression of the plot:

1.  **Initial Situation**: The farmer realizes his crop is ripe and decides to rely on his neighbors for help. The mother Lark remains calm because she knows that relying on the favors of others often leads to delay or lack of action.
2.  **The Turning Point**: The crop begins to over-ripen and fall. The farmer changes his strategy. Instead of waiting for neighbors or friends, he decides to take personal responsibility and hire laborers to do the work under his direct supervision the very next day.
3.  **The Conclusion**: The mother Lark recognizes that the harvest will finally happen because the farmer is now taking the initiative himself.

The lesson taught is that a task is only certain to be completed when one takes personal responsibility for it rather than waiting for the assistance of others. This is a classic illustration of self-reliance.

- **A) Self-help is the best help:** This aligns perfectly with the farmer's decision to stop waiting for friends and to handle the task himself.
- **B) Cunning often outwits itself:** Not applicable; there is no trickery involved.
- **C) Wisdom grows with determination:** While the farmer becomes determined, the core of the fable is about the source of the help (self vs. others).
- **D) The Golden Rule:** Not applicable to the mechanics of the harvest success.
- **E) Nature's promise:** This is a poetic sentiment but not the moral lesson regarding the farmer's actions.

The traditional moral of this Aesop's fable is that self-help is the most reliable path to success.

As soon as he realized what was going on, Aesop -- who w",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** Aesop, a man known for his wisdom, is observed engaging in a ""childish"" activity (playing marbles). An observer laughs at him, assuming that a wise man must always be serious and that playfulness is a sign of madness.
2.  **The Challenge:** Aesop uses a metaphor involving an unstrung bow. He challenges the critic to explain the significance of the object.
3.  **The Explanation:** Aesop explains that a bow kept under constant tension (""tightly strung"") will eventually break and lose its utility. However, if the bow is allowed to remain unstrung and ""rest,"" it preserves its strength and is ready for use when needed.
4.  **The Moral Application:** This metaphor applies to the human mind and spirit. Constant focus, work, or seriousness (keeping the bow ""strung"") leads to burnout or failure. Engaging in play or relaxation is not a sign of foolishness, but a necessary period of ""rest"" that ensures the mind remains sharp and effective for serious tasks.

Among the options:
- **A** directly addresses the lesson of the bow: that rest is essential for maintaining the mind's function.
- **B** is irrelevant to the plot.
- **C** describes the observer's situation but isn't the primary lesson.
- **D** focuses on the conflict rather than the philosophical point of the bow.
- **E** is a secondary observation (that the ""mad"" behavior was actually wise), but the specific point Aesop makes is about the necessity of rest.

The most accurate moral is that periodic relaxation and play are necessary to maintain one's mental strength and readiness.

'I breed only one,' said the lioness, 'but he is very ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interaction between the sow and the lioness:

1.  **The Interaction:** The sow is boasting about the size of her litter (quantity). She ""loudly accosts"" the lioness, implying a sense of superiority based on the number of offspring she can produce.
2.  **The Response:** The lioness acknowledges she only produces one offspring at a time. However, she retorts that her one offspring is a lion—a creature of significantly higher status, strength, and ""quality"" than a pig.
3.  **The Lesson:** The fable contrasts numerical superiority (having many) with intrinsic value (being excellent). The lioness's single ""well-bred"" cub is presented as superior to the sow's numerous piglets.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Quality is more valuable than quantity:** This directly aligns with the lioness’s argument that one lion is better than many pigs.
*   **B) Gossips are to be seen and not heard:** This does not fit, as the sow is boasting, not necessarily gossiping.
*   **C) Confidence without humility leads astray:** While the sow is overconfident, the core of the retort is about the status of the child, not a moral failing of confidence.
*   **D) Setting aside disputes:** The story does not focus on the danger of the conflict itself, but on the outcome of the comparison.
*   **E) Nurturing is key:** The story is about the result of the breeding, not the process of raising the children.

The classic moral of this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Lioness and the Sow"") is that one excellence is worth more than many mediocrities.

morables_179,"Running swiftly, balancing on the razor's edge, bald but with a lock of hair on his forehead, he wears no clothes; if you grasp him from the front, you might be able to hold him, but once he has moved",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1.  **Analyze the Imagery:** The fable describes a figure (Caerus, the personification of Opportunity) who is moving very fast (""running swiftly"") and is precarious (""on the razor's edge""). 
2.  **Analyze the Key Physical Trait:** The figure has hair on his forehead but is bald in the back. This means he can be caught from the front as he approaches, but there is nothing to grab onto once he has passed by.
3.  **Analyze the Consequence:** The text explicitly states that once he has ""moved on,"" not even the most powerful god (Jupiter) can pull him back. 
4.  **Identify the Symbolism:** The story identifies this figure as a ""symbol of Opportunity, the brief moment in which things are possible.""
5.  **Determine the Lesson:** The emphasis is on the brevity and the ""one-way"" nature of opportunity. Because you cannot catch it once it passes, you must act while it is right in front of you.
6.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A) Seize opportunities when they arise:** This aligns perfectly with the idea of grasping the hair on the forehead before the figure passes.
    *   **B) Be content with your lot:** Irrelevant to the imagery of the moving figure.
    *   **C) Power without purpose is ineffectual:** While Jupiter is mentioned, the focus is on the timing of the action, not the purpose of power.
    *   **D) Boast of one powerful thing...:** This is the moral associated with a different fable (The Fox and the Cat), not this one.
    *   **E) Every daring act teeters...:** While ""razor's edge"" suggests risk, the core of the fable is the impossibility of regaining a missed chance.

**Conclusion:** The lesson is that opportunity must be taken immediately because it is fleeting and unrecoverable once missed.

He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions of the characters step by step:

1.  **The Fox's Behavior:** The fox is clearly aware that the meat is a trap (she is ""pondering every possible approach""). Instead of warning the wolf, she uses false friendliness (""one of my very dearest friends"") and flattery to trick the wolf into triggering the trap so she can observe the danger or remove the obstacle at his expense.
2.  **The Wolf's Mistake:** The wolf takes the fox's ""gift"" at face value without questioning why she isn't eating the meat herself. He is deceived by her words of friendship.
3.  **The Outcome:** The fox’s ""kindness"" was actually a deceptive ploy that resulted in the wolf getting hurt. The wolf's concluding remark highlights that the fox's friendship is a pretense used for harm.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Flatterers and deceivers are not to be trusted:** This fits perfectly. The fox uses the guise of friendship and generosity to deceive the wolf into a dangerous situation.
*   **B) Know yourself and your limits:** This is more applicable to stories like ""The Tortoise and the Hare."" 
*   **C) Trust can be a double-edged sword:** While true, this is too vague. The story specifically focuses on the *source* of the trust (a deceiver).
*   **D) A single reliable skill...:** This is the moral for ""The Fox and the Cat.""
*   **E) Caution is wise...:** Collaboration did not occur here; it was exploitation.

The story serves as a warning against those who offer ""gifts"" or show sudden, excessive kindness when there is an ulterior motive or hidden danger.

Winter was approaching, so one of the dung beetles said to the other, 'I want to g",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Promise:** One beetle promises to bring food back to his friend if he finds a good feeding ground on the mainland.
2.  **The Outcome:** The beetle finds an abundance of food, gets fat and healthy, but returns empty-handed.
3.  **The Excuse:** He blames the ""nature of the place"" for why he couldn't fulfill his promise, essentially admitting that while he benefited personally, the promise was ultimately hollow or impossible to keep from the start.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Beware of empty promises made during good times:** This fits the narrative. The beetle made a grand promise when he was planning his journey, but when faced with the reality of his own comfort and the logistics of the situation, the promise went unfulfilled. It warns the reader that people often make promises they cannot or will not keep when circumstances change.
*   **B) We should not pick fights with people stronger than we are:** There is no conflict or fighting in this story.
*   **C) Curiosity can uncover hidden resources:** While the beetle found food, the focus of the story is on the broken promise, not the act of discovery.
*   **D) There's a curious time for work and an expectant time for play:** This does not reflect the interaction between the two beetles.
*   **E) Even the smallest creatures find value in what others discard:** While true of dung beetles generally, it is not the lesson regarding the interaction between the two friends.

The story highlights the unreliability of promises made by those who go off to seek their own fortune or comfort.

When they came to a well, one of them thought that they should jump in immediately, but the other one said, ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the steps and themes of the fable:

1.  **The Situation:** Two frogs are in need of a new home because their current one dried up.
2.  **The Decision:** They find a well. One frog wants to act immediately (jump in) because there is water available right now.
3.  **The Caution:** The second frog stops to consider the future consequences. If the water in the well dries up (just as their previous pond did), they will be trapped deep underground with no way to climb back out.
4.  **The Lesson:** The second frog is demonstrating the importance of thinking about the potential consequences of an action before committing to it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Look before you leap:** This matches the story perfectly. The frog literally pauses before ""leaping"" into the well to consider the consequences. It is a classic idiom for considering risks before acting.
*   **B) Watch the actions of your enemy:** There are no enemies in this story.
*   **C) Haste often leads to regret:** While true, ""Look before you leap"" is the more specific and traditional moral associated with this Aesop's fable.
*   **D) Impulsive, vicious people...:** This is irrelevant; the frogs are not being vicious or trying to hurt others.
*   **E) Adaptability is key...:** The story is more about caution and foresight than adaptability.

The story warns against taking an action that solves a temporary problem but creates a permanent, inescapable one later.

He saluted the gods who came to congratulate him one after another, but when he was approached by Plutus, the god of wealth and th",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the key elements:

1.  **The Characters**: Hercules represents **Virtue** and **Excellence** (he was admitted to heaven because of his ""excellent qualities""). Plutus represents **Wealth**.
2.  **The Conflict**: Hercules refuses to acknowledge Plutus while greeting all other gods.
3.  **The Reasoning**: Hercules explains that he hates Wealth because it is a ""friend to the wicked"" and ""corrupts the entire world.""

**Step-by-step evaluation of the options:**
*   **A) Coffers of cash put a stop to honest traffic in praise**: This is a direct translation of the traditional moral of this Aesop's fable (*""Pecuniae munitio prohibet sincerum laudis commercium""*). It suggests that wealth interferes with honest recognition of merit, which aligns with Hercules' disdain for how money rewards the wicked rather than the virtuous.
*   **B) Easy life and seeming good fortune...**: This focuses on the well-being of the wealthy, which is not the point of Hercules' speech.
*   **C) Wealth cannot buy true excellence**: While true in a general sense, the story focuses more on how wealth actively corrupts and favors the wicked.
*   **D) Corrupting thieves...**: This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) Virtue paves the path to the highest rewards**: Hercules' entry into heaven supports this, but the specific dialogue and central conflict of the fable focus on the rejection of Plutus (Wealth), not the reward of Hercules.

In classical literature and compilations of Aesop's fables, this story specifically serves to show that those who value virtue (Hercules) must despise wealth (Plutus) because wealth often empowers the unworthy. Option A capture the essence that wealth disrupts the ""honest traffic"" (the proper flow) of praise and reward.

The dog summoned the wolf as his witness",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Offense:** A dog and a wolf conspire to frame an innocent sheep using false testimony. 
2.  **The Injustice:** Due to the lie, the sheep is unjustly punished and forced to pay a debt she did not owe.
3.  **The Resolution:** Shortly thereafter, the wolf (the liar) meets a fatal end in a ditch.
4.  **The Lesson:** The sheep explicitly states that the wolf's death is the ""reward that gods give to liars,"" indicating that divine or poetic justice has been served.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Wicked liars generally get their just consequences:** This aligns perfectly with the sheep's concluding remark and the wolf's fate.
*   **B) Harsh means vs. kind means:** This doesn't apply, as the sheep didn't use harsh means; the wolf met a natural or accidental end.
*   **C) Deception masks innocence:** While true in the first half, it is not the ultimate ""lesson"" or outcome of the story.
*   **D) One insult invites another:** This suggests the sheep should have acted differently to prevent further harm, which isn't the focus.
*   **E) False claims unravel trust:** While true in a general sense, the story focuses specifically on the *punishment* of the liar.

The story serves as a warning that while a lie might succeed in the short term, the liar will eventually face retribution.

2.  **The Plea:** The Lark attempts to argue for her life based on logic and justice. She points out that her ""crime"" (eating a grain of corn) is minor and that she has not stolen valuable things (gold or silver).
3.  **The Result:** The Fowler does not care about the sense of justice or the triviality of the Lark's actions. He is the one with the power to kill and the one who benefits from the kill. He serves as both the captor (adversary) and the person deciding the outcome (judge).
4.  **The Communication:** The Fowler ignores the argument entirely (""without deigning any reply"") and proceeds with his intent.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) When your adversary is also your judge, don't bother arguing.** This directly reflects the futility of the Lark's plea. When the person you are arguing against is the one who holds all the power and acts as the final authority, your logic will not save you.
*   **B) People are willing to risk their lives for the sake of some petty profit.** While the Lark died for a grain of corn, the story focuses more on the interaction and the Fowler's refusal to listen rather than the Lark's risk-taking.
*   **C) Mercy is louder than silence.** This is the opposite of what happens; the Fowler is silent and shows no mercy.
*   **D)** This is a complex sentence that doesn't align with the cynical, straightforward outcome of this specific Aesop fable.
*   **E)** The story proves the opposite—sincerity was completely powerless.

The story traditionally illustrates that appeals to justice or mercy are useless when the person you are pleading with is the one intent on your destruction.

morables_82,"Be quiet now, said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap. If you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf. Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Nurse:** She makes a threat (""I will throw you to the Wolf"") that she does not intend to keep. Her words are opportunistic and used merely to influence behavior (quieting the child).
2.  **The Wolf:** He takes the Nurse's word literally, expecting her to fulfill her ""promise."" He waits based on the belief that her words reflect her actual intent.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Nurse does the opposite of what she said; instead of giving the child to the wolf, she calls the dogs to attack him.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Enemies' promises were made to be broken:** This is the traditional moral of this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Nurse and the Wolf""). It warns that one should not trust the words of an enemy or an opportunistic person, as their ""promises"" are often empty or deceitful.
*   **B) Untrustworthy people blame others:** There is no blaming occurring in the text.
*   **C) Cunning plans silence noisy fears:** This doesn't fit, as the wolf's plan failed and the child's noise wasn't a fear.
*   **D) No reward for serving the wicked:** The wolf wasn't ""serving"" the nurse; he was acting in his own interest.
*   **E) Harsh words hide protection:** While the nurse's threat was to protect her peace (or the child's safety from the wolf indirectly), the core of the fable focuses on the wolf's misplaced trust in the nurse's spoken word.

The story teaches us that we should not believe everything we hear, especially when the speaker has no intention of following through on their words. Traditionally, this fable illustrates that ""Enemies' promises were made to be broken"" (or similarly, ""Do not trust those who say one thing and mean another"").

Then the fly laughed at the man and said, 'You wanted to avenge the sting of a ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the actions:

1.  **The Action:** A man accidentally hurts himself while trying to kill a fly that bit him. 
2.  **The Fly's Mockery:** The fly suggests that the man is foolish for hurting himself in an attempt to get revenge for a small sting, and questions how he will handle the ""insult"" he dealt himself.
3.  **The Man's Reasoning:** The man distinguishes between the **intent** behind the two actions. He forgives himself for the slap because he did not *intend* to hurt himself (it was an accident). Conversely, he remains committed to destroying the fly because the fly *intended* to harm him.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Intent matters more than the outcome:** This aligns with the man's defense. He values his own accidental slap differently than the fly's intentional bite because of the motive behind it.
*   **B) Rudeness/Sharing:** Not relevant to this specific fable.
*   **C) Forgiveness outshines mockery:** While he forgives himself, the core of the argument is *why* he is justified in doing so.
*   **D) Frustrated self-effort:** This is too vague and doesn't capture the conflict between the man and the fly.
*   **E) In anger, we may cause ourselves more harm:** While the man did slap himself, the text explicitly focuses on his rebuttal about **intent** vs. the fly's malicious nature. In traditional versions of this Phaedrus fable, the emphasis is on the distinction between accidental injury and intentional malice.

The man's dialogue explores the philosophy that an injury inflicted by accident (lack of intent) is easily forgiven, whereas a small injury inflicted with malice deserves a heavy penalty.

The Hunter agreed, but said: 'If you desire to conquer the Stag, you mus",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Horse wants revenge on the Stag but cannot achieve it alone.
2.  **The Deal:** The Horse seeks the Hunter's help. The Hunter agrees but imposes conditions that require the Horse to surrender his physical autonomy (the bit and the saddle).
3.  **The Outcome:** The Horse achieves his immediate goal (defeating the Stag) but discovers he has traded his permanent freedom for a temporary victory. 
4.  **The Consequences:** The Hunter refuses to release the Horse, realizing he now has a useful servant under his control.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A:** Captures the transactional nature of the deal. The Horse used the Hunter, so the Hunter now uses the Horse.
*   **B:** Directly addresses the core trade-off: The Horse chose to suffer the ""injury"" of the Stag rather than be enslaved by the Hunter. This is a classic phrasing of the moral for this specific Aesop's fable.
*   **C:** Focuses on cunning vs. dominance, which is less relevant than the loss of freedom.
*   **D:** Focuses on the ephemeral nature of vengeance, which is a theme, but lacks the warning about power dynamics.
*   **E:** Close, but ""guidance"" is too mild a term for the physical bondage and loss of sovereignty described.

While A and E are related, the most complete lesson—and the one historically associated with this fable (often titled ""The Horse, the Hunter, and the Stag"")—is that it is better to endure a wrong from an enemy than to surrender your liberty to a ""protector"" who will then enslave you. Choice B most accurately reflects the tragic trade-off the Horse made.

You have such ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Cat's Motivation:** The cat wants the eel that the stork is carrying but does not want to get wet or exert himself.
2.  **The First Tactic (Flattery):** The cat tries to get the stork to open its mouth by complimenting its beauty and asking a question about the color of the inside of its beak. If the stork had answered, she would have dropped the eel.
3.  **The Stork's Reaction:** The stork recognizes the trap and remains silent to protect her prize. She stays focused on her meal and ignores the distraction.
4.  **The Second Tactic (Insults/Provocation):** When flattery fails, the cat turns to insults and name-calling to goad the stork into responding out of anger.
5.  **The Resolution:** The stork continues to ignore the cat and walks away with her eel intact.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Stay focused on your goals:** This fits the stork's behavior perfectly. Despite flattery and then insults, she did not let the cat distract her from keeping her meal.
*   **B) Do not fear death...:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C & E) Beauty/Flattery masks intentions:** While true for the cat, these options only cover the first half of the story. They don't account for the cat's shift to insults or the stork's successful resistance.
*   **D) Don't be seduced by cunning words...:** This is a possible secondary lesson, but the story's main focus is the stork's steadfastness in the face of *both* flattery and abuse.

The stork's success comes from her refusal to be distracted by outside noise (whether positive or negative), choosing instead to stay focused on her goal (keeping the eel).

'At the moment I am thi",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Opportunity:** The wolf has the dog in a vulnerable position (""sleeping in front of the barn"") and could have eaten him immediately.
2.  **The Deception:** The dog uses a persuasive promise (getting ""fattened up"" at a wedding) to convince the wolf to delay his meal.
3.  **The Result:** The wolf loses his initial meal because he was greedy for a better one later. The dog moves to a safer location (the roof) and explicitly tells the wolf that he won't be caught in that vulnerable position again.

**Analysis of choices:**
*   **A) Take what you can get when you can get it:** This fits the wolf's failure perfectly. He had a meal and let it go based on a promise of something better, only to end up with nothing. This is a common theme in Aesop's fables (similar to ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"").
*   **B) Liberty:** The dog wants to stay alive, but the focus is on the strategy used to escape, not an abstract love of freedom.
*   **C) The cunning prey on the gullible:** While true, the dog is the ""prey"" here using cunning to survive, rather than a predator preying on the weak.
*   **D) Cunning enemies' persuasive promises...:** This is overly complex and mislabels the dog as the ""predatory nature"" when it is actually the wolf who is the predator.
*   **E) A plea for mercy...:** This suggests the dog will eventually be eaten, but the story implies the dog has learned how to stay safe.

The primary lesson for the wolf (and the reader) is that one should not pass up a certain advantage or resource in the hopes of a better one later, especially when that ""better one"" relies on the promise of an adversary.

When he finally decided to disembark, he said, 'I will let myself down now as fast as I can so as not to burden",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the interaction between the gnat and the camel step by step:

1.  **The Gnat's Perspective:** The gnat believes his presence is a significant weight. He assumes his departure is an act of consideration that will greatly relieve the camel. He views himself as having a noticeable impact on the situation.
2.  **The Camel's Perspective:** The camel is completely indifferent. He did not feel the gnat land and does not feel him leave. To the camel, the gnat is non-consequential and irrelevant to the ""load"" he carries.
3.  **The Disconnect:** The humor and the lesson lie in the gap between the gnat's self-importance and the reality of his insignificance to others.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A:** This directly addresses the theme. The gnat views himself as a ""consequence"" (a burden that matters), while the neighbor (the camel) does not even notice him.
*   **B:** While the gnat is technically ""arrogant"" and ""has no influence,"" the core of the story is specifically about *self-perception* versus *external perception*.
*   **C:** The story isn't really about the camel's patience; it's about the gnat's vanity.
*   **D:** There are no ""misfortunes"" involved in this story.
*   **E:** While true, this is a literal observation rather than a moral lesson about character or vanity.

The most traditional and accurate moral for this Aesop-style fable is that many people overestimate their own importance in the lives or affairs of others.

The fox turned to the women and said, 'What shouts there would be aga",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the conflict and the dialogue:

1.  **The Context:** A group of women are eating roasted chickens that belong to them (their own property).
2.  **The Fox's Grievance:** The fox observes them and complains about a double standard. He points out that if he were to eat those same chickens, he would be hunted, shouted at, and attacked by dogs.
3.  **The Rebuttal:** An old woman clarifies the distinction. The women have the right to eat the chickens because the chickens belong to them. The fox, however, is a thief who takes what belongs to others.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that rights and permissions are tied to ownership and legality. Just because someone is allowed to do something with their own property does not mean a stranger or an outsider has the right to do the same to that property.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses this distinction: we cannot assume we have the right to do with others' property what they are permitted to do with it themselves.
*   **B** mentions ""false friends,"" which are not present in the story.
*   **C, D, and E** focus on ""silence"" or ""malice,"" which are descriptive elements of the scene but do not capture the core ethical lesson regarding property and behavior.

morables_245,"A viper entered a blacksmith's workshop and bit the file, testing it to see if this was something she could eat. The file protested fiercely, 'You fool! Why are you trying to wound me with your teeth,",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the viper and the file:

1.  **The Action:** A viper tries to bite or harm a tool (a file) made of a material much harder than its own teeth.
2.  **The Response:** The file points out the futility of the viper's attack. The file's nature is to wear down or ""gnaw through"" iron; therefore, the viper's attempt to wound the file is not only unsuccessful but self-destructive.
3.  **The Meaning:** The story illustrates the folly of attacking something or someone that is impervious to your weapons or who is naturally stronger and more durable than you. It specifically highlights the pointlessness of trying to harm an object (or person) that cannot be ""wounded"" by such means.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) It is useless attacking the insensible:** In many classical translations of Aesop (such as the Perry Index), the moral is described as ""It is useless attacking those who can bite back harder"" or ""It is foolish to attack those who are insensible to injury."" The file is ""insensible"" because it is a hard object that cannot be hurt by teeth.
*   **B) Words vs. Action:** This does not fit the context of the story.
*   **C) Curiosity without wisdom:** While the viper was curious, the core lesson is about the futility of the attack on a superior/harder substance.
*   **D) Forgiveness and Indignation:** The story is not about social forgiveness, but about physical/practical futility.
*   **E) Boasting:** The file only speaks after it is bitten; the story focuses on the viper's mistake rather than the file's boasting.

Option A is the most accurate representation of the traditional moral of this fable (often phrased as ""It is useless to attack those who can hurt you more than you can hurt them"" or ""attacking the invulnerable"").

As they were disputing, they passed a statue carv",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the conflict and the resolution:

1.  **The Conflict**: A Man and a Lion are arguing over who is superior. The Man uses a piece of art (the statue) as objective ""proof"" of human superiority.
2.  **The Lion's Rebuttal**: The Lion points out that the statue is biased because it was created by a human. If a lion had been the sculptor, the imagery would be reversed to show the lion's dominance.
3.  **The Lesson**: The fable highlights that ""truth"" or ""history"" is often shaped by the person telling the story. Evidence provided by one side is rarely the whole truth, as it reflects the perspective and interests of the creator.

Evaluations of the options:
*   **A) One story is good, till another is told.** This directly addresses the idea that a narrative seems convincing until a different perspective or counter-narrative is presented. It emphasizes that point of view dictates how events are portrayed.
*   **B)** The Lion and Man are both boasting; the focus is on the perspective of the ""deeds,"" not the bravery itself.
*   **C)** While the Man is prideful, the core of the Lion's witty comeback is about the bias of the source, not necessarily the downfall of the Man.
*   **D)** This focuses on ""inner worth,"" while the story is specifically about the representation of power and the bias of ""statues"" (media/history).
*   **E)** Cooperation is not the theme; the competition of perspectives is.

The most accurate moral, traditionally associated with this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Lion and the Statue""), is that the person who tells the story determines the hero.

On his way to the assembly of the birds, the peaco",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character's motivations:

1.  **The Setup:** The peacock is described as beautiful and courteous. He is on his way to an ""assembly of the birds,"" a social or political gathering.
2.  **The Interaction:** The raven asks for feathers. The peacock asks what he will get in return. The raven offers to ""squawk your praises throughout the courts."" This appeals to the peacock's desire for status and recognition (vanity).
3.  **The Pattern:** The peacock repeats this transaction with the crow, the cuckoo, and ""all kinds of other birds."" He prioritizes the public praise and the appearance of his ego over his own physical needs.
4.  **The Consequence:** Because he gave away his feathers for the sake of reputation, he is left ""plucked completely bare."" This leaves him unable to protect himself or his chicks from the elements.
5.  **The End:** Winter arrives, and the peacock dies due to his lack of feathers.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Vanity can lead to self-destruction:** This fits perfectly. The peacock sacrificed his means of survival (feathers) for the vanity of having his praises sung in the ""courts.""
*   **B) Do not boast to have something you do not:** The peacock actually had the feathers, so this doesn't fit.
*   **C) Opportunism can overshadow courtesy:** While the other birds were opportunistic, the story focuses on the peacock's choice and his subsequent death, placing the moral weight on his actions.
*   **D) Sorrow not over what is abandoned:** The peacock did not choose to be resilient; he died.
*   **E) True beauty shines through kindness:** The story suggests the opposite—that the peacock's initial ""kindness"" (largely fueled by a desire for praise) led to his demise.

The peacock's desire for social status and ""praises"" (vanity) led him to give away his essential tools for survival, ultimately killing him.

1.  **The Conflict:** A tiny Gnat challenges a powerful Lion. Through agility and targeting the Lion's weaknesses, the Gnat succeeds in defeating a much larger foe.
2.  **The Persistence of Pride:** Following the victory, the Gnat celebrates and boasts (""buzzing about in a song of triumph"").
3.  **The Downfall:** In his moment of glory and boasting, the Gnat fails to notice a simple danger—a spider's web—and is killed by an ""inconsiderable"" insect.
4.  **The Lamentation:** The Gnat realizes the irony of his fate: he defeated the ""hugest beast"" only to be undone by something small and common.

Let's evaluate the options:
- **B** refers to trusting a humble enemy, which does not fit this scenario.
- **C** and **D** touch on pride and cunning, but the story's specific focus is on the sudden reversal of fortune following a boastful victory.
- **E** is a general observation but doesn't capture the irony of the Gnat's death.
- **A** captures the essence of the ""reversal of fortune."" The Gnat’s downfall happens precisely because he is blinded by his own success and boasting, proving that no matter how great your victory or how loud your boast, you are still vulnerable to being undone by the smallest of things.

In some versions of Aesop's fables, this specific story is explicitly paired with the moral: ""The least of our enemies is often the most to be dreaded,"" or ""Success should not make us off our guard, for a reverse is often at hand.""

All of a sudden a tuna fish",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Struggle:** The fishermen are working hard (""struggled for a long time"") but their skills and efforts are failing to yield results. 
2.  **The Despair:** They are ready to quit because their intentional actions are unsuccessful.
3.  **The Turning Point:** A tuna fish lands in their boat not because of their fishing skill, but because of a random event (it was fleeing a predator). 
4.  **The Outcome:** They achieve their goal through a stroke of fortune rather than their own labor.

Looking at the options:
*   **A:** Directly addresses the contrast between ""skill"" (the fishermen's struggle) and ""luck"" (the fish jumping into the boat). This is a classic Aesop-style moral regarding fortune.
*   **B:** Relates to the ""The Reed and the Olive Tree"" or similar fables about size/reputation, which doesn't fit here.
*   **C:** Is a sentiment, but doesn't capture the mechanic of *how* the joy was achieved (luck vs. effort).
*   **D:** This is incoherent.

Not withstanding all his prayers, instead of becoming richer, he got poorer. Out ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the narrative arc:

1.  **The Action:** A man prays to a wooden idol for wealth but receives nothing.
2.  **The Turning Point:** Frustrated (and arguably no longer ""worshipping"" the idol as a sacred object), he violently smashes the idol.
3.  **The Result:** The physical act of destruction reveals hidden gold that prayer did not provide.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The man immediately changes his outlook. He stops viewing the idol as a deity to be revered and instead views it as a ""graceless deity"" that only responds to force.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) People adjust their beliefs based on what is profitable for them:** This fits the man’s behavior perfectly. He initially believed the idol was a god to be petitioned. When he found the gold through violence, he abandoned his religious reverence and adopted a pragmatic view of ""force over prayer"" because it yielded results.
*   **B) Only a man who is out of his mind...:** This is irrelevant to the lesson of hidden wealth or the man's change in perspective.
*   **C) Impatience can lead to graceless outcomes:** The outcome here was actually a success (finding gold), so this doesn't fit the result of the story.
*   **D) Impatient opposites are utterly gracelessly incompatible:** This is nonsensical in the context of the fable.
*   **E) Fortune favors the bold who challenge fate:** While the man was bold, the central irony of the story (and the specific wording of his exclamation) focuses on his shifting attitude toward the idol based on the profit gained.

Classic collections of Aesop's Fables categorize this story (The Man and the Wooden God) with the moral that people or ""gods"" are often judged or treated according to how much benefit they provide.

morables_225,"When a gnat had challenged a bull to see who was the stronger of the two, all the people came to watch the show. Then the little gnat said to the bull, 'It's enough for me that you have accepted my ch",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the key events and the narrator's commentary:

1.  **The Action:** A tiny gnat challenges a mighty bull. The bull accepts the challenge.
2.  **The Gnat’s Strategy:** Instead of fighting, the gnat claims victory simply because the bull acknowledged him as a worthy adversary. By accepting the challenge, the bull implicitly treated the gnat as an equal.
3.  **The Lesson:** The text explicitly states that if the bull had ignored the gnat (treating him as ""beneath contempt""), the gnat would have had nothing to boast about. By engaging with an unworthy or insignificant opponent, the bull allowed his own reputation and status to be diminished to the level of the gnat.

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the text’s conclusion. The bull lowered his dignity by dignifying a ridiculous challenge.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; children and arts are not mentioned.
*   **C:** While the gnat is proud, the primary lesson focuses on the bull's mistake in engaging.
*   **D:** This does not match the narrative logic of the story.
*   **E:** While technically true, the story focuses more on the loss of status through the association of the contest rather than just the futility of the contest itself.

The moral is that by engaging with someone far beneath your status or merit, you grant them a status they do not deserve and diminish your own.

morables_651,"There was a bob-tailed dog advertised in a newspaper, and someone who recognized him by his markings brought him back to his owner. The owner began to question the dog, asking how he could be so ungra",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the dialogue between the owner and the dog:

1.  **The Owner's Argument:** The owner claims to be ""kind"" because he never personally struck the dog or spoke harshly to him. He views himself as innocent of any mistreatment.
2.  **The Dog's Rebuttal:** The dog points out that while the owner didn't physically strike him, the owner **ordered** others to do so. To the dog, there is no difference between the owner doing it himself and the owner delegating the task to a third party.
3.  **The Lesson:** The core of the dog's argument is that responsibility for an action lies with the person who authorizes or initiates it. Using an intermediary does not absolve a person of the moral weight of the deed.

Looking at the options:
*   **A)** focuses on the delegation of actions, aligning perfectly with the dog's logic that an act performed ""through another"" is the owner's ""own action.""
*   **B)** misplaces the focus on ""words,"" whereas the story is about actions and responsibility.
*   **C)** misses the point that the owner wasn't actually kind; he was deceptive about his cruelty.
*   **D)** refers to trusting promises, which isn't the central theme here.
*   **E)** is a plot point (how the dog was found) but not the moral lesson.

The logic of the dog's statement—""When I am beaten by your order, I consider it as if you yourself are beating me""—is a direct match for Option A.

morables_541,"Some castrated sheep had been gathered together in a flock with the rams. Although the sheep realized that the butcher had come into the flock, they pretended not to see him. Even when they saw one of",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the correct moral, let’s analyze the steps of the story:

1.  **Indifference and Complicity:** The sheep observe a threat (the butcher) but choose ""not to see him"" and ignore the deaths of their peers because it does not immediately affect them.
2.  **Self-Centered Logic:** They rationalize their inaction by saying, ""He keeps his hands off me... let him take whom he takes."" They believe that as long as they are not the current victim, they are safe.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because they failed to act collectively when they had the strength of numbers, they are picked off one by one until only one remains, defenseless and alone.
4.  **The Realization:** The final sheep realizes that their failure to protect each other led to their individual dooms.

Now, let's look at the options:
*   **A)** aligns perfectly with the theme of collective responsibility and the danger of silence. This is famously mirrored in the ""First they came..."" poem by Martin Niemöller.
*   **B)** refers to the fable of the frogs asking for a king, which is unrelated.
*   **C)** is a general truth but doesn't capture the specific warning against failing to defend one's community.
*   **D)** refers to a different type of fable involving wit.
*   **E)** The sheep weren't trying to ""fit in"" with the butcher; they were ignoring him.

The core lesson is that by failing to stand up for the members of the group being taken first, the remaining members ensure their own destruction.

morables_131,"There was a hooligan who struck Aesop with a stone. Aesop said, 'Well done!' and he even gave the boy a coin. Then he added, 'Confound it, that's all the cash I've got, but I'll show you more where th",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **Initial Action:** A hooligan commits a reckless act (striking Aesop with a stone).
2.  **Apparent Success:** Instead of punishing him, Aesop tricks the boy by rewarding him with a coin. This makes the boy believe that his bad behavior will consistently lead to profit and ""success.""
3.  **The Mistake:** Emboldened by this small success, the hooligan repeats the behavior on a more powerful target, expecting a greater reward.
4.  **The Consequence:** Because he was led astray by the initial ""reward,"" he loses his life.

Now, evaluating the options:
*   **A) Success leads many astray to their ruin:** This fits perfectly. The hooligan’s initial ""success"" (getting the coin) gave him a false sense of security and encouraged him to continue his dangerous behavior, which eventually led to his execution.
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for:** The boy didn't really ""wish"" for something that backfired; he was manipulated into an action.
*   **C) Clever minds outwit reckless wealth:** Aesop is clever, but the second victim is ""wealthy,"" not the hooligan.
*   **D) Avoid reckless overindulgence in manipulative pursuits:** This is too wordy and misidentifies the primary actor's downfall. 
*   **E) Responding with grace can disarm hostility:** Aesop didn't respond with grace to disarm; he responded with a trap to ensure the boy was punished.

The traditional moral of this specific Phaedrus/Aesop fable is that rewarding bad behavior encourages a person to repeat it until they encounter someone who will punish them. The ""success"" of the first act leads to the ruin of the actor.

morables_584,"Winter made fun of Spring and mocked her for the fact that as soon as spring appears, nobody can keep still: some people go off to the meadows or into the woods, others like to gather flowers and lili",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue between Winter and Spring:

1.  **Winter's Argument:** Winter prides itself on its power to control behavior through fear and restriction. It compares itself to a ""dictator or a despot,"" noting that it makes people ""tremble"" and forces them to stay indoors and look at the ground.
2.  **Spring's Argument:** Spring points out that while Winter might have the power to command, that power makes people want to ""get rid of"" it. In contrast, Spring is beloved; people look forward to it, find pleasure in its name, and give thanks for its arrival because it brings freedom and joy.
3.  **The Lesson:** The contrast focuses on two different styles of influence: one based on fear and force (Winter/Despotism) and one based on affection and happiness (Spring). The conclusion of the fable highlights that being cherished and welcomed is superior to being a feared tyrant.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) It is better to be loved than feared:** This directly matches the contrast between Spring's popularity and Winter's tyrannical control.
*   **B) Use care to place your blame on the right person:** There is no ""wrongful blame"" in this story.
*   **C) Power can be both beloved and despotic:** While true, the story's conclusion emphasizes the preference for the beloved over the despotic.
*   **D) Powerful talent is wasted...:** The story is not about talent or lack of appreciation, but about the nature of one's influence on others.
*   **E) Even the harshest seasons have their own beauty...:** The story actually portrays Winter as boastful of its harshness rather than defending its beauty.

The moral is a classic Aesopic lesson: influence gained through kindness and beauty is more enduring and desirable than influence gained through fear.

morables_655,"A Soldier who already had one excellent horse bought another that was not nearly as good, yet he took more care of the new one than the first. Everyone wondered at this, since the new horse was neithe",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Premise:** A soldier owns an excellent horse (proven quality, beautiful, and useful).
2.  **The Action:** He buys a new horse that is objectively inferior (less beautiful, less useful).
3.  **The Conflict:** He neglects the superior horse to give more attention and care to the inferior new one.
4.  **The Observation:** Others notice this lack of logic. A commentator remarks that it is simply ""natural"" to be fond of the ""newest arrival,"" implying that the soldier's behavior is driven by the novelty of the new acquisition rather than its actual merit.
5.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights a flaw in human nature where we favor things simply because they are new, even when they are objectively less valuable than what we already possess.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A** focuses on the fleeting nature of pleasure, but the story is specifically about the *preference* for something new/inferior over something established/superior.
*   **B** discusses contentment and disaster, which are not present here.
*   **C** talks about beauty vs. usefulness, but here the old horse has both and the new horse has neither.
*   **D** discusses ""wicked men,"" which is irrelevant to the text.
*   **E** directly addresses the irony of the soldier’s behavior: valuing a less worthy object more than one that truly deserves the care.

While some versions of this fable (often attributed to Aesop or similar collections) use the moral ""New things are always most prized,"" option **A** is the recognized traditional moral for this specific version of the fable (often titled ""The Soldier and his Horses""). It highlights that the novelty (""everything pleases at first"") is what causes the temporary, misplaced devotion.

morables_423,"A seagull having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die. A Kite saw him and exclaimed: 'You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no bus",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A seagull attempts to eat a fish that is too large for it. This results in the bird’s fatal injury (bursting its gullet).
2.  **The Conflict:** The seagull’s death is caused by attempting to take something that exceeds its natural capacity or ""proper"" place, as perceived by the observer.
3.  **The Commentary:** A Kite (another bird) observes the dying seagull and offers a critique: ""You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no business to seek its food from the sea."" 
4.  **The Lesson:** The Kite’s comment highlights the idea that the seagull stepped outside of its natural domain (the air) to interfere with another domain (the sea). While modern biology knows seagulls eat fish, in the context of Aesop’s Fables, this story is used to illustrate the danger of overreaching or interfering in affairs that are not one's own.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A) Every man should be content to mind his own business:** This aligns perfectly with the Kite’s moralizing statement that the bird had ""no business"" in the sea. It suggests staying within one's own sphere of life.
- **B) Learn from past misfortunes:** The seagull dies, so it cannot learn from this misfortune.
- **C) Greed breeds misfortune...:** While the seagull was greedy, the specific rebuke from the Kite focuses on the ""business"" of where the bird sought its food.
- **D) Supply enemies with means of destruction:** This is the moral for ""The Eagle and the Arrow,"" not this fable.
- **E) Patience is key:** This is irrelevant to the seagull's physical overextension.

In traditional collections of Aesop's Fables, this specific story (The Seagull and the Kite) is used to illustrate that one should stick to their own sphere of activity or ""mind their own business.""

They urged one another to approach the river, but no one dared to get too close bec",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of foxes is thirsty, but the river is dangerous. They are all cautious of the current.
2.  **The Action:** One fox decides to show off. She isn't jumping in to drink, but rather to ""embarrass her fellow foxes"" and prove she is ""braver than the rest.""
3.  **The Consequence:** She is immediately swept away by the current. She has no control over her situation and is effectively drowning or being lost to the river.
4.  **The Response:** When her friends ask her to come back and show them the way, she makes an excuse (""I've got a message to take to Miletus"") to hide the fact that she is helpless and in danger.

**Analyzing the Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The fox's boastful desire to appear braver than the others led her to take a foolish risk that resulted in her being swept away.
*   **B:** There is no ""profit"" or ""greed"" involved; the motivation was pride/vanity.
*   **C:** Boldness did not quench any thirst; it led to the fox being swept away without getting a proper drink.
*   **D:** While she was mocking others, the central theme is her own boastful action leading to her downfall.
*   **E:** The story portrays the fox's ""courage"" as foolishness/bravado rather than a wise or necessary trait.

The fable (attributed to Aesop) is intended to illustrate how those who boast or act out of vanity often find themselves in precarious situations they cannot escape, and they frequently try to disguise their failure with further lies.

1.  **The Context:** The lion tries to act justly but cannot change his predatory nature. He seeks a justification to kill and eat the other animals without appearing overtly tyrannical.
2.  **The ""Trap"":** He creates a no-win scenario by asking about his breath.
    *   Those who told the truth (bad breath) were killed.
    *   Those who lied/were diplomatic (it doesn't smell) were killed.
3.  **The Monkey's Attempt:** The monkey tries extreme flattery (breath like ""the altar of the gods""). While this temporarily saves him from the first trap, the lion simply invents a different excuse (playing sick) to eat him anyway.
4.  **The Conclusion:** Regardless of whether the animals were honest, lied, or flattered, the outcome remained the same: they were consumed by the powerful predator once he had set his mind to it.

**Option Analysis:**
*   **A:** Captures the essence of the ""trap."" Whether you speak the truth, lie, or try to stay out of it, the tyrant finds a way to punish you. 
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there are no old friends mentioned.
*   **C:** This describes the monkey's behavior or the lion's facade, but the story's focus is on the inevitability of the animals' deaths regardless of their words.
*   **D:** This relates to a different fable (The Donkey in the Lion's Skin).
*   **E:** This is a ""nice"" sentiment that the story actually subverts (the lion fails to lead with integrity).

The story (found in various Aesopic traditions and the *Romulus* collections) illustrates that when a tyrant decides to be cruel, no answer—truthful or flattering—can save the victim.

The partridge immediately started squawking his usual song, sauntering through every room in the house un",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the behavior of the characters and the conflict between them:

1.  **The Partridge's Behavior:** The partridge is a newcomer to the house. Despite being there for only one day, it immediately begins to ""squawk,"" ""saunter"" through every room, and make itself the center of attention by perching and cackling loudly. It acts with a sense of entitlement and lack of restraint despite its new surroundings.
2.  **The Weasel's Perspective:** The weasel, a long-term resident of the house, points out the breach of etiquette. The weasel explains that even though it has a long-standing history in the house (born there to a ""mouser-slayer""), it remains quiet and respectful of the hearth. 
3.  **The Conflict:** The weasel's rebuke centers on the idea of **propriety** and **rank**. The newcomer (the partridge) is acting boldly and loudly before it has earned its place or understood the ""rules"" and customs of its new home.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable serves as a warning to those who enter a new environment and immediately behave with overbearing confidence or noise without respecting the established order or those who were there before them.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses the need for a newcomer to respect the environment/household they enter.
*   **D** mentions ""confident vanity,"" which the partridge displays, but the story is more focused on the breach of social conduct regarding a new environment than ""self-destruction"" (as the weasel's critique is the primary focus, not necessarily the partridge's death).
*   **B, C, and E** do not fit the specific interactions between the weasel and the partridge.

The moral is that newcomers should be humble and observe the customs of the places they enter.

Stung by the sharp pain,",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** The fox is in a moment of vulnerability (falling) and reaches out for support to save herself.
2.  **The Action:** She grabs a bramble bush. By nature, a bramble bush is covered in thorns and ""grabs"" or pricks anything that touches it.
3.  **The Conflict:** The fox is hurt by the thorns and complains, expecting the bush to have behaved differently because the fox was in need.
4.  **The Resolution/Lesson:** The bramble bush points out the fox’s mistake: the fox reached out to something that is inherently harmful/prickly by nature. The bush did not change its nature just because the fox needed help.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A)** This is the most accurate. The fox expected ""kindness"" (support) from something that is ""naturally unkind"" (the prickly bramble).
*   **B)** This refers to boasting, which is not present in this story.
*   **C)** While the fox was stung, this is a literal observation rather than the overarching lesson about the fox's poor judgment.
*   **D)** This refers to ""cat and fox"" style fables regarding skills/tricks, which is not the focus here.
*   **E)** While logically sound, it misses the character-driven point of the fable—that you shouldn't ask for help from those whose character is known to be harmful.

The traditional moral of this Aesop's fable is that it is foolish to expect help from those whose nature is to do harm.

But the fuller told him, 'How on earth would I be able to carr",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the roles and the conflict:

1.  **The Charcoal Burner:** His profession involves soot, dust, and blackening materials.
2.  **The Fuller:** His profession involves cleaning and whitening cloth.
3.  **The Conflict:** If they live and work together, the nature of the charcoal burner's work will inherently ruin the work of the fuller. One creates ""black,"" while the other creates ""white.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that people with fundamentally different and conflicting natures or interests cannot successfully combine their lives or businesses. Their core activities cancel each other out.

Now, let's look at the options:
*   **A) Opposites are utterly incompatible:** This directly reflects the conflict between the ""black"" soot and the ""white"" cloth. Their natures are at odds, making a partnership impossible.
*   **B) Appearances can be deceiving:** This doesn't apply; the issue is their actual work, not their looks.
*   **C/D/E:** While ""shared understanding"" or ""caution"" are general virtues, they don't capture the specific classical moral of this Aesop's fable, which focuses on the impossibility of uniting two incompatible things.

Historically, the moral of this fable (often titled ""The Boy and the Filbert"" or ""The Charcoal-Burner and the Fuller"") is that ""Like should associate with like"" or that opposites are incompatible.

Some travellers coming from the opposite direction asked the man how he",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:
1.  **The Crime and Deception:** A murderer is caught with bloody hands. To hide his guilt, he lies to passersby, claiming the red stains are merely juice from a mulberry tree (effectively blaming or using the tree as a scapegoat for his crime).
2.  **The Consequence:** The pursuers catch him and execute him specifically on a mulberry tree.
3.  **The Dialogue:** The mulberry tree speaks, expressing that it feels no guilt or sadness about being the instrument of his death. The tree explicitly states that its lack of mercy is because the murderer tried to ""smear"" its reputation by attributing his crime to it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This matches the tree's reaction. The tree, an ""honest"" entity in this context, does not hesitate to participate in the ""persecution"" (execution) of the man because he slandered the tree by using it as a cover for his murder. This is the traditional moral associated with this Aesopic fable (Perry Index 170).
*   **B)** This refers to stoicism, which is not the focus of the tree's dialogue.
*   **C)** While the curiosity of the travelers led to the questioning, the central point of the ending is the tree's justification for the execution.
*   **D)** This refers to greed and vanity, which are not present in this story.
*   **E)** While true in a general sense, the fable concludes with the specific dynamic of the slandered party (the tree) taking satisfaction in justice.

Option A best captures the ""punishment for slander"" theme emphasized by the tree's final speech.

The lion woke up and immediately grabbed the wretched little mouse with his paw,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central theme:

1.  **The Act of Mercy:** The lion (a powerful creature) shows mercy to a tiny, insignificant mouse. He chooses to let the mouse go despite having the power to kill it.
2.  **The Reversal of Fortune:** Later, the lion is trapped and helpless. The ""small"" creature he spared is the only one capable of saving him.
3.  **The Reciprocation:** Because of the lion's initial kindness, the mouse returns the favor, proving that even a small creature can be of great help to a powerful one.

Comparing the options:
*   **A) No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The lion's ""small"" mercy (letting a mouse live) resulted in his own life being saved later.
*   **B) Unequal matches bring misery:** False; the unequal match between the lion and mouse led to mutual benefit.
*   **C) Cleverness can free the trapped:** While the mouse used its teeth to gnaw the ropes, the core of the story is about the *reason* the mouse helped (gratitude for kindness), not just the method.
*   **D) Those who act in their own innocent self-interest...:** This contradicts the story; the mouse was genuinely grateful.
*   **E) Even the smallest actions can awaken great consequences:** While true in a literal sense (the mouse running over the lion woke him up), it doesn't capture the pedagogical ""moral"" of the fable regarding character and behavior as well as option A.

The most traditional and accurate moral for Aesop's ""The Lion and the Mouse"" is that mercy and kindness are rewarded, regardless of the size of the participants.

morables_56,"The Pigeons, terrified by the appearance of a Kite, called upon the Hawk to defend them. He at once consented. When they had admitted him into the cote, they found that he made more havoc and slew a l",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Threat:** The Pigeons are afraid of a Kite (a bird of prey).
2.  **The Solution:** They seek protection from a Hawk (an even more powerful predator).
3.  **The Result:** The Hawk, once invited inside, kills more Pigeons in a single day than the Kite would have in an entire year.

**Analysis:**
The Pigeons attempted to solve a problem (the fear of the Kite), but the ""remedy"" they chose (the Hawk) proved to be far more destructive than the original threat. While option E is a reasonable modern interpretation regarding allies, **Option A** is the classical moral historically associated with this Aesop's fable (""The Kites and the Swans"" or ""The Pigeons and the Hawk""). It specifically addresses the irony that the cure for the problem was worse than the problem itself.

- Option B refers to fables where enemies fight each other and leave the innocent alone.
- Option C is a secondary theme, but the primary focus is on the disproportionate damage caused by the ""savior.""
- Option D refers to fables where one must argue a case before a predator (like ""The Wolf and the Lamb"").

Option A most accurately captures the lesson that seeking a dangerous solution to a manageable problem leads to a worse outcome.

morables_394,"When Zeus had fashioned man and woman, he ordered Hermes to take them to Gaia, the Earth, and to show them how to obtain food by digging in the ground. At first, the Earth refused to cooperate in Herm",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Origin:** Zeus creates humans and intends for them to sustain themselves by farming (""digging in the ground"").
2.  **The Conflict:** Gaia (the Earth) is reluctant to allow humans to wound her surface for food.
3.  **The Resolution:** Coerced by Zeus's authority through Hermes, Gaia relents but adds a heavy condition: humans may take what they need, but it will be through ""groans and tears"" (hard labor and sorrow).

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Easy gains often come with hidden costs and hardships:** The story illustrates that the ""gain"" (sustenance/food from the earth) is not easy; it is extracted through toil and suffering as a result of a cosmic bargain.
*   **B) Do not fight with those who are perfectly capable of fighting back:** While Gaia ""fights back"" with a curse, the central theme is the nature of human survival, not a warning against picking fights.
*   **C) Power can sway the reluctant:** While true that Hermes/Zeus sway Gaia, this describes a plot point rather than the ""moral"" (the lesson for the reader/humanity).
*   **D) Powerful physical stature...:** Not relevant to the text.
*   **E) Guidance is the seed of self-sufficiency:** The story highlights the cost of survival rather than the benefits of the guidance itself.

The fable serves as an ""aetiological"" myth—explaining *why* human life is defined by hard labor. It suggests that nothing is provided for free by nature; every bit of sustenance extracted from the earth is paid for with the ""price"" of human suffering and effort.

The butcher turned around and said to him, 'You haven't stolen my heart; indeed, I have taken heart from this lesson! So if you eve",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Event:** A dog successfully steals meat (specifically a heart) from a butcher's shop.
2.  **The Butcher's Reaction:** Instead of simply losing the meat, the butcher uses a pun on the word ""heart."" He explains that while he lost a physical organ, he ""took heart"" (gained courage or wisdom) from the experience.
3.  **The Lesson:** The butcher realizes he was caught off guard and vows to be vigilant. He has learned from this negative experience to prepare for future encounters, effectively turning a loss into a cautionary lesson.
4.  **The Core Message:** The story emphasizes that when someone is tricked or robbed, the ""silver lining"" is the wisdom gained from the experience, which prevents them from being a victim a second time.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Experience teaches valuable lessons and encourages caution:** This directly aligns with the butcher ""taking heart"" (learning) and preparing for the dog's return. 
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** Less relevant; the story focuses more on the butcher's reaction than the dog's inherent nature.
*   **C) Boldness without caution leads astray:** While the dog was bold, the story's resolution focuses on the butcher's newfound wisdom.
*   **D) Better to face a bold... danger:** This is a moral for a different fable (usually regarding wolves and sheep).
*   **E) Desire can lead to actions that betray trust:** There was no trust between the dog and the butcher to begin with.

The focus of the butcher’s speech is his own education through experience.

morables_498,"There was a bullock who had been turned loose in the fields without ever having borne the burden of the yoke. When he saw a hard-working bull who was pulling a plow, the bullock said to him, 'You poor",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Conflict:** A young, idle bullock mocks an older, hardworking bull for the ""hard work"" he must endure under the yoke. The older bull stays silent and continues his labor.
2.  **The Turn of Events:** The situation reverses. The working bull is rewarded with rest and pasture, while the idle bullock—having been kept fat and ""free"" for a specific purpose—is led away to be slaughtered as a sacrifice.
3.  **The Resolution:** The older bull points out that the bullock's lack of a ""yoke"" (labor) was actually a sign of his impending doom. The bullock’s earlier mockery was premature and based on a misunderstanding of his true situation.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) He laughs best that laughs last:** This fits perfectly. The bullock laughed at the bull initially, but by the end of the story, the bull is the one who survives and has the final word, while the bullock faces a grim fate.
*   **B) The great do not always prevail:** This does not apply, as the ""great"" (the older, stronger bull) actually does prevail here.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers youthful naivety:** While the bull is wise, the point of the story is the reversal of fortune and the danger of idleness/arrogance, not just a lesson in temperament.
*   **D) He that is neither...:** This is nonsensical in the context of the fable.
*   **E) One should not judge others...:** While somewhat relevant, this is more of a modern platitude. The traditional moral of this Aesop-style fable focuses on the irony of the bullock’s ""freedom"" leading to his death.

In traditional collections of Aesop’s Fables, ""The Bull and the Bullock"" is most frequently associated with the moral that idleness leads to ruin or that one should not mock those who work, as those who do not work are often being prepared for a worse fate. Among the choices provided, the most fitting idiomatic moral for this reversal of status is ""He laughs best that laughs last.""

A man who was planning to make such a voyage had brought his monkey along with him,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character's behavior:

1.  **The Situation:** A monkey is saved by a dolphin during a shipwreck because the dolphin mistakes him for a human.
2.  **The Deception:** The monkey is asked if he knows Piraeus (the harbor). To appear more important and knowledgeable than he actually is, the monkey lies and pretends Piraeus is a person he knows well.
3.  **The Consequence:** The monkey’s lie is exposed because Piraeus is a place, not a person. Realizing the monkey is a fraud, the dolphin becomes angry and lets him drown.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The monkey ""pretended to be what he was not"" (a knowledgeable Athenian human) and literally ended up in ""deep water"" as a result of his dishonesty.
*   **B:** There is no moral here about crowds versus individuals.
*   **C:** The monkey's plan was to lie, which caused infuriation, not calmed it.
*   **D:** While truth-telling is relevant, this choice is phrased awkwardly and doesn't capture the essence of the fable as well as A.
*   **E:** Companionship failed here because it was built on a lie.

**Conclusion:** The fable serves as a warning against boasting and lying about things one does not know. Exposure of such lies often leads to ruin.

morables_25,"A Certain House was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this, made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the lesson learned by the characters:

1.  **The Conflict:** A cat is successfully eating mice until the mice realize the danger and stay in their holes.
2.  **The Deception:** The cat, unable to reach the mice, attempts a trick by hanging from a peg and pretending to be dead to lure them out.
3.  **The Resolution:** The mice identify the cat's ruse. Having already witnessed the cat's lethal nature, they refuse to fall for the trick, even if the cat appears harmless (or disguised as something else, like a ""meal-bag"").
4.  **The Lesson:** The mice are cautious because they have already been ""deceived"" or harmed by the cat's presence. They have learned from their previous danger and refuse to trust the predator again, regardless of the disguise.

Looking at the options:
- **A) He who is once deceived is doubly cautious.** This fits perfectly. The mice, having learned the cat is a predator, exercise extreme caution and are no longer easily fooled.
- **B)** There is no collaboration between powerful/deceitful entities in this story.
- **C)** While caution does beat the cat's cunning, the phrasing of A is the classic Aesop moral associated with this specific fable (The Cat and the Mice).
- **D)** There are no ""subordinates"" in this story.
- **E)** While the cat is opportunistic, the focus of the story's conclusion is on the wisdom/caution of the mice.

The most accurate moral, which focuses on the wisdom gained through experience and the inability of a known deceiver to regain trust, is A.

Just as he was about to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and wak",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the dialogue and the actions within the fable:

1.  **The Situation:** A traveler chooses to sleep on the edge of a deep well—a precarious and dangerous position.
2.  **The Intervention:** Dame Fortune wakes him, not necessarily out of kindness, but to protect her own reputation.
3.  **The Lesson:** Dame Fortune explicitly states that humans often blame ""Fortune"" or ""Bad Luck"" for their misfortunes, even when those misfortunes are actually the result of their own foolish decisions (like sleeping on the brink of a well).
4.  **The Conclusion:** The story teaches that individuals are responsible for the outcomes of their actions. While people like to blame fate, their own choices usually determine their safety or peril.

- **Choice A** (""Everyone is more or less master of his own fate"") aligns perfectly with the idea that our own ""folly"" or ""wisdom"" dictates our success or failure, rather than external luck.
- Choice B is irrelevant to the plot.
- Choice C is a literal observation of the traveler's state but not the philosophical point of the fable.
- Choice D relates to conflict and strife, which are not present here.
- Choice E describes the setup of the story but misses the ""Fortune vs. Personal Responsibility"" message that the dialogue emphasizes.

Therefore, the moral is that we are responsible for our own destinies.

morables_168,"When a man had made an axe, he asked the trees to give him a handle made of the hardest wood. The other trees selected the wood of the wild olive. The man took the handle and fitted it to his axe. The",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the actions and consequences in the fable:

1.  **The Action:** The trees provide the man with a handle (a resource/tool) made of hard wood.
2.  **The Result:** The man immediately uses that handle to fit his axe and destroy the very trees that helped him.
3.  **The Realization:** The oak tree realizes that by providing the man with the means to harm them, they brought about their own destruction.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This is a strong candidate because the trees essentially armed their enemy, leading to their downfall.
*   **B:** While the trees put themselves in the man's power, this phrasing is slightly more abstract and specific to legal/philosophical definitions often found in other Aesop fables (like ""The Wolf and the Lamb"").
*   **C:** This is a very strong candidate. The trees were ""generous"" by giving the wood, but they lacked the ""wisdom"" to foresee how that gift would be used against them.
*   **D:** This suggests the trees were forced, but the text says they ""selected"" the wood, implying a choice.
*   **E:** This does not fit the narrative arc of the fable.

Between A and C, we look at the traditional moral associated with this Aesop's fable (*The Woodcutter and the Trees*). The core lesson emphasizes that those who provide their enemies with the means to destroy them are the architects of their own ruin. While ""generosity without wisdom"" (C) is applicable, the most direct lesson regarding the specific interaction with the ""enemy"" who asks for help is captured in A. 

However, looking at the phrasing of many classic translations (like those by Townsend or James), the moral is often stated as: ""In yielding the rights of others, we may endanger our own,"" or more simply, that we should not provide the tools for our own destruction to those who might use them against us.

Option A directly addresses the specific folly of the trees: helping an enemy (the man with the axe-head) obtain the one thing he lacks to be dangerous.

morables_527,"The crab's mother said to him, 'My son, why do you walk in a crooked line when you should be walking straight ahead?' The crab said to her, 'O mother, lead the way, and I will try to walk accordingly.",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Precept:** The mother crab gives her son a lecture (a precept) on how he should behave, telling him to walk straight instead of crookedly.
2.  **The Challenge:** The son asks the mother to demonstrate the behavior she is demanding (to lead by example).
3.  **The Failure:** The mother is physically unable to perform the task she commanded her son to do.
4.  **The Lesson:** One cannot effectively teach or command others to do what they cannot or will not do themselves. Instruction is hollow if the instructor does not provide a practical example to follow.

Reviewing the options:
*   **A) Example is more powerful than precept.** This fits perfectly. It highlights that showing how to do something (example) is more effective and necessary than simply telling someone to do it (precept).
*   **B) Contentment...** This relates to happiness and being satisfied with one's situation, which is not the focus here.
*   **C) Those who cannot see the path...** While the mother is guiding the son ""astray"" (orthopedically speaking), the core of the fable is about the hypocrisy of her demands.
*   **D) Hypocritical equals...** The characters are mother and son, not equals, and the focus is on leadership/parenting rather than friendship.
*   **E) Even the crooked...** This contradicts the ending, where neither crab is able to walk straight.

The classic moral of this Aesop's fable is that one should set a good example if one expects others to follow.

When the fox found out about this she paid a visit to the wolf a,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Wolf:** He is a thief who has accumulated a ""store of booty"" (stolen goods). He is also spiteful and rejects the fox.
2.  **The Fox:** She is a deceiver who attempts to manipulate the wolf. When spurned, she betrays the wolf to the shepherd. She then feasts on the wolf's stolen goods (the ""larder"").
3.  **The Outcome:** The wolf is killed by the shepherd. The fox is eventually caught and killed by hunters, acknowledging her ""serious crime"" and the fact that she ""brought about someone else's death.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Take pleasure when thieves destroy themselves:** This lesson fits the narrative arc. Both characters are essentially ""thieves"" or dishonest actors (the wolf with his physical booty, the fox with her deceptive ways). The story illustrates a cycle of betrayal and destruction among the wicked. It suggests that when the dishonest turn on one another, it leads to their own downfall. Historically, this fable (often attributed to Aesop or Phaedrus) is summarized with the sentiment that we should rejoice when the wicked perish by each other's hands or when their own malice destroys them.
*   **B) Never trust a known deceiver:** While true, the story is more about the mutual destruction of the wolf and fox rather than a warning to the shepherd or others about trust.
*   **C) Gratitude tempers relentless spite:** This contradicts the story; no gratitude is shown, and the spite leads to death.
*   **D) Cunning wit has always a spiteful answer ready:** This describes the dialogue, but not the overarching lesson of the fox's death.
*   **E) Isolation in abundance can lead to unexpected companionship:** This is the opposite of what happens.

The story highlights that the wolf’s hoard and spite led to his death, and the fox’s betrayal of her ""own kind"" (fellow predators/thieves) led to her eventual demise. This aligns with the classical interpretation that people should take satisfaction in the self-destruction of the wicked.

1.  **The Hook:** An Eagle and a Serpent are locked in a struggle.
2.  **The First Good Turn:** A countryman intervenes and saves the Eagle's life.
3.  **The Retaliation:** Out of spite, the Serpent poisons the man's water.
4.  **The Second Good Turn:** The Eagle, recognizing the man as its savior, knocks the poisoned water away, saving the man's life in return.

The core of the story is the exchange of life-saving favors between the man and the Eagle. The man helped the Eagle, and in return, the Eagle helped the man. This sequence illustrates the proverb that one act of kindness is repaid by another.

- **Choice A** (""One good turn deserves another"") directly reflects this reciprocal kindness.
- Choice B relates to greed, which isn't the focus here.
- Choice C describes the Serpent's action but doesn't capture the ultimate resolution of the story.
- Choice D (a variation of a moral often found in *The Farmer and the Viper*) focuses on the danger of the snake, but ignores the Eagle's gratitude.

His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, My master gives a feast, a",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of this fable (often attributed to Aesop and titled ""The Dog and the Cook""), let’s examine the narrative elements:

1.  **The Action:** A dog enters a house not because he was invited by the owner (the Rich Man), but through a ""backdoor"" invitation from another dog. He is an intruder in the eyes of the household staff.
2.  **The Consequence:** Because he has no legitimate right to be there, the Cook treats him as a nuisance and throws him out the window.
3.  **The Aftermath:** The dog is humiliated and has to lie to his peers to save face, pretending he left of his own accord due to indulgence rather than being forcibly ejected.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) ""Those who enter by the back stairs may expect to be shown out at the window.""** This is the classical moral of this specific fable. It means that those who obtain benefits through unauthorized, unofficial, or ""sneaky"" means should not be surprised when they are treated unceremoniously or evicted harshly.
*   **B)** There are no ""enemies"" making promises here; the friend was sincere but lacked the authority to invite him.
*   **C & E)** These focus on ""generosity,"" but the story is a cautionary tale about presumption and trespassing, not a celebration of giving.
*   **D)** This relates more to fables involving traps or predators; here, the ""danger"" was the consequence of the dog's own social overstepping.

The story teaches that relying on unofficial invitations or trying to gain access to benefits through ""the back door"" often leads to a sudden and painful exit.

He ordered that the bag of coins be brought to him as he was dying and then asked",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the key elements of the fable:

1.  **The Character:** The protagonist is a ""miserly man"" with ""ill-gotten"" wealth. This establishes themes of greed and unethical gain.
2.  **The Effort:** He ""sweated"" over these coins, indicating a life spent entirely on the accumulation of wealth.
3.  **The Outcome (Heirs):** The money he hoarded will be squandered by others on ""women and drinks,"" meaning his personal sacrifice did not result in a noble legacy or lasting value.
4.  **The Outcome (Spiritual):** The bag of money explicitly states it will bring pleasure to ""demons"" because his soul will face ""eternal torments"" as a result of how he lived/acquired the money.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) A life of greed and hoarding wealth leads to misery:** While partially true, the story focuses more on the specific consequences of *ill-gotten* wealth and the irony of the legacy.
*   **B) Government/chiefs:** Irrelevant to the text.
*   **C) Ill-gotten gains bring eternal torment:** This captures the climax of the story. The bag explicitly links the coins to the demons and the torment of his soul.
*   **D) Unfamiliar things:** Irrelevant to the text.
*   **E) The fruits of toil may not always yield the intended legacy:** This is a strong theme (his heirs squandering his hard work), but it ignores the spiritual weight emphasized in the final sentence of the fable regarding his ""ill-gotten"" gains and the demons.

While there are multiple lessons, the most comprehensive moral regarding the irony of a miser's life—accumulating sin (ill-gotten gains) only to lose the money to profligate heirs and his soul to torment—is best summarized by the consequences of his actions. Option C directly addresses the ""ill-gotten"" nature and the ""eternal torments"" mentioned in the text. However, often in these specific classical fables (similar to those by Aesop or in medieval collections), the focus is on the worthlessness of the wealth and the spiritual cost. Comparing C and A, C is more specific to the text's mention of ""ill-gotten"" and ""torment.""

The city mouse finished his business in the country and by means of insistent inv,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Setup:** The story contrasts two lifestyles: the country mouse's ""humble meal of acorns"" (representing poverty/simplicity) and the city mouse's ""various delicacies"" (representing wealth/abundance).
2.  **The Conflict:** While enjoying the wealth of the city, the mice are interrupted by a human (the butler). The city mouse is safe because he knows where to hide, but the country mouse is terrified and ""frightened out of his wits.""
3.  **The Resolution:** The city mouse tries to convince the country mouse to stay for the sake of the delicious food.
4.  **The Climax/Lesson:** The country mouse refuses, explicitly stating that he prefers his ""acorns"" (poverty/simplicity) as long as he is ""secure in his freedom"" (peace of mind/safety from fear).

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A:** This directly aligns with the country mouse’s conclusion. He chooses his simple, safe life over an abundant life filled with terror and worry.
*   **B:** While generic, it doesn't capture the specific trade-off between luxury and peace described in the text.
*   **C:** This describes the city mouse's ability to hide, but it is not the ""moral"" or the main lesson the story intends to convey.
*   **D:** This is a proverb related to betrayal, which does not happen in this story.
*   **E:** This describes the plot (the invitation) but ignores the negative outcome and the final lesson.

The beetle then felt contem",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative arc:

1.  **The Situation:** A beetle is dissatisfied with his humble life in a dung heap after observing the majesty of an eagle. 
2.  **The Flaw:** He becomes arrogant and delusional, claiming his voice and appearance are equal to the eagle's and deciding he is too good for his natural environment (""I will not crawl around in the dung any more!"").
3.  **The Action:** He attempts to fly with the birds and join a society for which he is physically and naturally ill-equipped.
4.  **The Consequence:** He fails miserably, is physically broken, and finds himself far from home and starving.
5.  **The Realization:** He realizes his mistake and wishes only to return to his original, humble state, acknowledging that his ambition led to his downfall.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the beetle's journey. His arrogance and ""putting on airs"" led him to abandon his secure life, resulting in failure and the loss of his ""former position"" (his home/food source).
*   **B)** This is the moral of a different Aesop's fable (*The Eagle and the Beetle*), but it does not fit this specific story.
*   **C)** The story warns against trying to be something you are not; it does not promote diversity.
*   **D)** This is a quote from Christopher Marlowe's *Tamburlaine*, focused on physical force, which is irrelevant here.
*   **E)** While the beetle had a moment of ""lofty wonder,"" it was a destructive delusion rather than a positive spark.

The story serves as a classic cautionary tale against hubris and abandoning one’s station/nature through vanity.

I can't decide what to do: my love of money and my innat",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the character's behavior and the conflict presented:

1.  **The Conflict:** The protagonist finds a treasure (a lion made of gold). He is torn between two traits: his **greed** (desire for the gold) and his **cowardice** (fear of the lion's shape/image).
2.  **The Futility:** Despite holding a fortune in his hands, he cannot bring himself to touch it or take it. He calls it a ""treasure that offers no satisfaction"" and a ""welcome gift... that is so unwelcome."" 
3.  **The Solution:** Rather than overcoming his fear to enjoy the wealth, he chooses to distance himself and involve others to do the work ""while I watch them from a distance.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The core irony is that the value of the gold is neutralized by the man's fear. He possesses the opportunity for wealth, but his character prevents him from actually benefiting from or ""possessing"" it in any meaningful way.

*   **Option A** directly addresses this irony: The gold has no ""value"" (utility or satisfaction) to the man because his fear prevents him from seizing/using it.
*   Option B is irrelevant to the text.
*   Option C is slightly off; greed isn't blinding him (he sees the gold clearly), it's his fear that is paralyzing him.
*   Option D contradicts the man's status (he is the master/ruler of the servants) and the story's focus on the gold.
*   Option E focuses on time/indecision, but the primary conflict is specifically the nature of **cowardice** vs. **wealth**.

The fable (attributed to Aesop) is intended to show that a cowardly person cannot truly enjoy the benefits of fortune because their nature prevents them from taking the necessary risks or even approaching the reward.

When opinions were exchanged back and forth, the ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interaction between the characters:

1.  **The Situation:** The hares propose a system of total equality and communal fairness to the assembly of beasts to prevent the strong from preying on the weak.
2.  **The Argument:** The hares argue based on the abstract principles of ""dignity"" and ""equal power.""
3.  **The Rebuttal:** The lions do not argue against the *concept* of the hares' words; they point out a practical reality. The hares' proposal lacks the physical enforcement (claws and teeth) necessary to back up their demands or secure their position in a world governed by power.
4.  **The Lesson:** This fable (attributed to Aesop or found in similar classical collections) illustrates that fine words and ideals of equality are ineffective if those proposing them lack the power or means to defend and implement them. It highlights the gap between idealistic rhetoric and the reality of power dynamics.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Be prepared to defend your position** aligns with the lions' observation that the hares' ""good words"" are useless without the ""claws and teeth"" to back them up. If you want equality or a change in status quo, you must have the means to enforce or defend that stance.
*   B is the moral of *The Lion and the Mouse*.
*   C is the opposite of what the lions imply.
*   D is a general sentiment not supported by the lions' dismissal.
*   E describes the process of the meeting but ignores the actual outcome/cynical point of the story.

The story teaches that for a position or a right to be respected, one must have the strength or means to defend it.

There was a whole crowd of monkeys there and one of them ,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the outcome for each character:

1.  **The Premise:** Two men—one a liar and one a truth-teller—encounter a group of monkeys led by a chief who mimics human imperial authority.
2.  **The Liar’s Action and Reward:** The liar uses flattery, calling the monkey an ""emperor"" and his followers ""nobles."" Because the monkeys *thrive* on this deception and vanity, they reward him with gifts.
3.  **The Truth-teller’s Expectation:** The honest man assumes that if lies are rewarded, the truth must be valued even more. This is a logical assumption in a just world, but the ""land of the monkeys"" is governed by vanity.
4.  **The Truth-teller’s Action and Consequence:** He speaks the literal, unvarnished truth: that they are all just monkeys. Instead of being rewarded, he is brutally attacked.
5.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that in an environment built on ego and deception (represented by the monkey ""emperor""), the truth is perceived as an insult. Those who prefer lies will actively punish someone who exposes reality.

*   **Choice A** aligns perfectly with this: The monkeys thrive on the liar's deception and retaliate against the one who speaks the truth.
*   **Choice B** is irrelevant; we know the characters' natures perfectly well.
*   **Choice C** is partially true (the monkeys are deceived), but the story focuses more on the *fate* of the truth-teller than the gullibility of the monkeys.
*   **Choice D** is incorrect; familiarity did not mollify the monkeys.
*   **Choice E** is the opposite of what happened; truth was not a defense at all; it was the cause of the man's injury.

Therefore, A is the most comprehensive moral for this specific fable.

This slave-woman, bedecked with gold and trailing a delicate purple robe aro",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative elements:

1.  **The Characters:** A man, an ""ugly, wicked"" slave-woman, and the goddess Aphrodite.
2.  **The Situation:** The man is infatuated with someone who possesses no objective beauty or virtue, showering her with wealth and status. 
3.  **The Slave-woman's Belief:** She believes her success is due to her own beauty or favors from the goddess of beauty (Aphrodite).
4.  **The Goddess's Response:** Aphrodite intervenes specifically to distance herself from the situation. She clarifies that she did not make the woman beautiful and expresses ""fury"" that the man finds her attractive.
5.  **The Lesson:** In Greek fables (this specifically being Aesop's Fable 130), a common theme is that when someone loves something objectively ""ugly"" or ""bad,"" it is a sign of a distorted mind or divine disfavor. Aphrodite's anger indicates that the man’s attraction is unnatural and offensive to the gods of beauty.

- **Choice A** aligns with the Greek concept that only a flawed or divine-cursed perception would find beauty in something ""ugly and wicked.""
- **Choice B** is incorrect as there is no mention of a conscience.
- **Choice C** is incorrect as the man's generosity is portrayed more as an absurdity than a virtue.
- **Choice D** is incorrect as the woman is not truly beautiful.
- **Choice E** is a modern sentiment that contradicts the goddess's statement that the woman is, in fact, not beautiful.

Based on the classical interpretation of this fable, the moral focuses on the man's inexplicable and ""mad"" attraction.

morables_134,A father had an unmanageable son who indulged his vicious adolescent temper by brutally whipping the slaves whenever his father wasn't looking. Aesop therefore shared this little story with the father,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the fable:

1.  **The Context:** A father has a son with a violent, unrestrained temper. To address this, Aesop tells a story about a farmer and a bull.
2.  **The Metaphor:** The young bull is aggressive and has injured others (""lamed many of the other bulls""). The farmer yokes the young bull to a steady, old bull.
3.  **The Purpose:** The farmer explains that the old bull’s role isn't heavy labor; it is to ""keep the young bull in check."" The old bull’s maturity and stability act as a physical and behavioral restraint on the young bull’s ""kicking and butting.""
4.  **The Application:** Aesop tells the father that he must keep his son close to him so that his own ""moderation"" (wisdom and calm temperament) can restrain the boy’s ""reckless inclinations.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) A mild disposition can put a stop to vicious behaviour.** This is the direct point of the metaphor. The ""moderation"" of the elder is used to counteract the ""vicious"" behavior of the youth.
*   **B) Do not mock the feelings of old age...** This is unrelated to the story's focus on restraint.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers reckless aggression.** This is also a strong candidate, as it captures the essence of the old bull/father guiding the young bull/son.
*   **D) Slow and wise steady wins the race.** This is the moral of *The Tortoise and the Hare*, not this fable.
*   **E) Unchecked behavior in youth can lead to greater harm.** While true within the story, this is the *warning* rather than the central *lesson* on how to solve the problem.

Between A and C, **A** aligns most closely with the specific phrasing used in traditional translations of this Aesop fable (often titled ""The Farmer and His Two Bulls"" or similar). The story emphasizes that the presence of a ""mild"" or ""moderate"" influence is the mechanism that stops ""vicious"" or ""reckless"" behavior. In the text provided, the farmer explicitly says the goal is to ""keep the young bull in check"" using the older bull's presence.

All the other passengers started to swim, but the Athenian kept praying to Athena, maki",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s look at the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Situation:** A ship has capsized, and the passengers are in life-threatening danger.
2.  **The Athenian’s Action:** He relies entirely on divine intervention, praying and making promises to the goddess Athena rather than taking physical action to save himself.
3.  **The Companion’s Advice:** ""While you pray to Athena, start moving your arms!"" This highlights that while faith or hope may have a place, they are useless in a crisis without personal exertion.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches that one must help oneself before (or while) expecting external or divine help. It emphasizes individual responsibility and the necessity of action.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Self-effort is essential:** This directly matches the message of the companion's advice. It reflects the famous proverb associated with this Aesop fable: ""Athena helps those who help themselves.""
*   **B)** Relates to education/wisdom, not relevant here.
*   **C)** Close, but ""Self-effort"" is the specific traditional moral of this story.
*   **D)** Irrelevant philosophical statement.
*   **E)** While true in a general sense, the specific focus of this fable is the contrast between prayer/passive waiting and physical effort.

Therefore, the moral is that one must take action to save oneself rather than relying solely on outside help.

1.  **The Conflict**: The Frog and the Mouse are so consumed by their rivalry and their status in the marsh that they commit to a ""fight to the death.""
2.  **The Distraction**: Because they are entirely focused on their internal struggle and ""armed combat,"" they lose all situational awareness. They are oblivious to their surroundings.
3.  **The Outcome**: A Kite (a predatory bird) takes advantage of their distraction. Instead of one winning the marsh, both lose their lives. The Kite ""runs away with the prize"" (the bodies of both combatants) without having to work for it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) When fools fight others run away with the prize.** This is the classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable. The ""fools"" are the Frog and Mouse, and the ""prize"" (the opportunity/the combatants themselves) is taken by the Kite.
*   **B)** Neither specifically set out to harm the other in a way that ""destroyed themselves in the bargain"" (like a suicide pact); they were simply intercepted by a third party.
*   **C & E)** These are plausible lessons (staying vigilant or being blinded by rivalry), but they are symptoms of the central irony. In the context of fables, the most traditional focus is on how a third party benefits from the discord of others.

Option A directly addresses the irony that their mutual hostility led to a third party (the Kite) winning everything.

The surviving daughter wondered to see strangers so much concerned at the loss of her sister, and he",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the narrative:

1.  **The Situation:** A mother has lost a daughter and has hired ""mourners"" (professionals) to attend the funeral.
2.  **The Observation:** The surviving daughter notices a paradox: the strangers (the professional mourners) are weeping loudly and appearing deeply concerned, while the actual family members appear less demonstrative.
3.  **The Explanation:** The mother explains that the family’s grief is internal and ""never the better for crying"" (performing for show), whereas the strangers are loud because they are being paid to do so.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) Professional mourners serve those who pay the most:** This captures the cynical essence of the story—that the outward display of emotion from the strangers is a transaction, not a reflection of genuine feeling.
*   **B) Often there is more good to be found in one man than in a crowd of people:** This is a general moral about character but does not fit the specific theme of hired grief.
*   **C) Curiosity thrives on observation:** While the daughter is curious, this describes the process of the story rather than its moral lesson.
*   **D) Pragmatic temptation can lead... to compromise integrity:** This is too complex for the simple observation of professional services being rendered.
*   **E) Grief can unite strangers in shared sorrow:** The story explicitly states the opposite; the strangers are *not* sharing the sorrow, they are being paid to simulate it.

The fable highlights that displays of emotion or loyalty can be purchased, and those with the least genuine connection to a situation often make the most noise because they are being compensated for it.

1.  **The Characters and Setting**: A traveler meets the personification of ""Truth"" in a desolate wilderness. Finding Truth in the desert—away from people—is a significant symbol.
2.  **The Conflict**: Truth is ""dejected"" and has effectively been exiled or has chosen to flee from human society.
3.  **The Dialogue**: When asked why she is in the wilderness rather than the city, Truth explains that in the past, lies were rare (""found among only a few""). However, in the present day, lies have ""spread throughout all of human society.""
4.  **The Lesson**: The story expresses a cynical view of contemporary humanity. It suggests that honesty has been driven out because falsehood is now pervasive among all people. Truth can no longer live in the city because there is no room for her where everyone is lying.

Looking at the options:
- **A) Falsehood is with all men**: This directly aligns with Truth’s statement that lies have spread throughout ""all of human society.""
- **B, C, D, E**: These options deal with self-importance, curiosity, lack of experience, or compassion, none of which are the focus of Truth's explanation for her exile.

As the ox stru",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the final outcome:

1.  **The Context:** The donkey and the ox are paired to share a single task (pulling a load).
2.  **The Conflict:** The donkey refuses to do his fair share of the work, forcing the ox to exert excessive effort.
3.  **The Consequence for the neighbor:** Because the ox receives no help, he dies from exhaustion and strain.
4.  **The Consequence for the selfish party:** Once the ox dies, the donkey is forced to carry not only the original load but also the weight of the dead ox. He is beaten for failing to handle this combined weight and ultimately dies as well.
5.  **The Lesson:** The birds explicitly state that the donkey’s death could have been avoided if he had been ""kind enough to help.""

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A)** aligns perfectly with the text. By failing to help his ""neighbor"" (the ox) with their shared burden, the donkey inadvertently caused that neighbor's burden (and the neighbor himself) to fall entirely upon his own shoulders, leading to his demise.
- **B)** is a general maxim about outcomes but doesn't capture the specific social lesson of cooperation.
- **C)** is incorrect because hard work did not ""triumph""; the hard-working ox died.

1.  **The Origin Hook:** The story begins by explaining that Man was created in a hurry, leading to the omission of Modesty. While ""haste"" is mentioned as the cause, it serves as the setup for the dialogue between Jupiter and Modesty, rather than being the primary focus of the lesson.
2.  **The Nature of Modesty:** Because she was not ""built-in"" to the human composition, she was released into the world as an external force among the multitude.
3.  **The Core Condition:** The climax of the fable occurs when Modesty agrees to exist among humans only on one specific condition: she will not stay in the presence of ""carnal love.""
4.  **The Conclusion:** Modesty explicitly states, ""wherever that [carnal love] comes... I'm gone."" This establishes a mutually exclusive relationship between the two.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A)** This directly reflects the final dialogue and the condition upon which Modesty agrees to exist.
*   **B)** ""Unreasonable requirements"" is not discussed; Jupiter’s request was accepted once conditions were met.
*   **C)** Haste is the premise, but the story focuses on the *conflict* between Modesty and Lust/Love, not the dangers of working quickly.
*   **D)** This refers to a completely different fable (The Old Man and Death).
*   **E)** The story portrays Modesty as fleeing rather than being ""gained"" as a shared virtue in certain contexts.

1.  **The Characters and Action:** A fox and a monkey are traveling together. The monkey makes a grandiose claim (that the people buried in the cemetery were his ancestors' freedmen). 
2.  **The Context:** The claim is made in a cemetery—a place where the subjects being discussed are dead and cannot speak.
3.  **The Fox's Observation:** The fox points out the convenience of the situation. He recognizes that the monkey is only telling this lie because there is no one present who can prove him wrong.
4.  **The Core Lesson:** The story highlights how braggarts and liars choose specific circumstances where their claims cannot be verified or challenged to inflate their own status.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the fox's point—that the monkey is exploiting the dead (who ""cannot rise up"") to tell a lie that can't be challenged.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there is no mention of old or new friends.
*   **C:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific detail of the story regarding the lack of witnesses.
*   **D:** The monkey doesn't necessarily get into ""deep water"" (trouble) in this specific fable; he is simply called out for his opportunism.
*   **E:** While they are on a shared path, the story focuses specifically on the lie told at the cemetery.

1.  **The Action:** A Farmer altruistically saves a dying creature (the Snake) by providing it warmth and life. This represents a ""great kindness.""
2.  **The Reaction:** Instead of showing gratitude, the Snake acts according to its ""natural instincts"" and bites its savior, causing his death. This represents ""ingratitude"" and the idea that some natures do not change based on treatment.
3.  **The Realization:** The Farmer admits he was ""rightly served for pitying a scoundrel,"" acknowledging that his kindness could not change the inherent nature of the animal.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Correct. It highlights that no matter how great the kindness (saving a life), someone with an ungrateful or malicious nature (""the ungrateful"" or ""scoundrel"") will not be changed by it.
*   **B:** Incorrect. The story shows the opposite; the man was rewarded with a mortal wound.
*   **C:** Incorrect. Gratitude is absent in this story, and the Farmer definitely feels regret.
*   **D:** Incorrect. This is a complex aphorism that doesn't fit the dynamic of the mortal betrayal described.
*   **E:** Incorrect. While compassion *did* revive the snake, the story focuses on the lethal consequence of that revival, not the beauty of the act itself.

2.  **The Conflict**: The blacksmiths notice the hypocrisy or selective attention of the dog. He is indifferent to the labor that sustains the household but highly alert to personal gain.
3.  **The Lesson**: The story illustrates how people (or animals) can be ""deaf"" or inattentive to duties, hard work, or things that do not personally serve them, yet remain incredibly sharp-eyed and attentive when there is a potential benefit for themselves.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A**: This matches the story perfectly. The dog ignores the ""heavy hammers"" (not his concern) but hears ""teeth chewing"" (his benefit).
*   **B**: This refers to the principle of agency, which is not present here.
*   **C**: While the story contrasts diligence (blacksmiths) with opportunism (dog), the specific dialogue focuses on the dog's selective perception rather than diligence ""outshining"" it.
*   **D**: This is the moral for ""The Wolf and the Lamb,"" referring to tyranny.
*   **E**: This is a modern interpretation of habituation, but not the traditional moral intended by Aesop's fables.

The classic moral for this fable (often titled ""The Blacksmith and his Dog"") is that people are often quick to notice what serves their own interests while ignoring the hard work or needs of others.

He greeted the unicorn and said to him, 'Let us put aside all that we have done in the past, because I am no ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the sequence of events and the dialogue:

1.  **The Context:** The lion and the unicorn are established as ""chief enemies.""
2.  **The Deception:** The lion feigns sickness and old age to appear harmless, appealing to the unicorn’s pity and sense of kindness.
3.  **The Mistake:** Despite their history, the unicorn believes the lion and surrender his defense (his horn). 
4.  **The Result:** The lion immediately betrays the unicorn once he is defenseless.
5.  **The Argument:** The unicorn laments the treachery, while the lion justifies his actions by stating that showing mercy or clemency to an enemy is a weakness that threatens one's own life. The unicorn counters that victory through guile is dishonorable.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** This directly addresses the central conflict: an enemy using humility and supplication to lower his opponent's guard. The unicorn’s downfall was precisely his decision to trust a known enemy because that enemy appeared ""humble and supplicating.""
*   **B:** There is no bragging involved in the story.
*   **C:** While true in a general sense, it is less specific than A. The story emphasizes that the threat comes specifically from an **enemy** pretending to be reformed/weak.
*   **D:** This is a corruption of the Golden Rule and does not represent the lesson intended for the reader.
*   **E:** While the unicorn says this at the end, the fable functions as a warning. Fables usually illustrate a practical lesson for survival. The unicorn is ""laid low"" (defeated/killed); his moral high ground does not save him. The lesson for the reader is how to avoid the unicorn's fate, which is to never trust the enemy.

Choice A captures the practical warning inherent in the lion's successful treachery and the unicorn's fatal mistake.

But being the ruler of the freshwater wasn't enough for him; he wanted to rule the sea too. With t",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** The Master-Pike is already a ""Prince"" in his own domain (the river). He possesses size, beauty, and strength relative to his environment.
2.  **The Conflict:** He becomes overly ambitious and dissatisfied with being the ruler of freshwater. He attempts to conquer a domain that is not his own (the sea).
3.  **The Result:** He encounters a much larger power (the Dolphin) that he cannot compete with. He is humbled and forced to retreat to his original home.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Pike learns to stay within his own territory and be satisfied with the status he has there, rather than risking everything to gain more than he needs or can handle.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Be content with your lot:** This fits perfectly. The Pike had a great life as the Prince of the River but risked it because he wasn't content. The ending shows him returning to his ""lot"" and staying there wisely.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you:** The story focuses more on the Pike's self-perception and ambition than the opinions of others.
*   **C) Strength without humility invites downfall:** While true, the story specifically emphasizes territory and being satisfied with one's current position (""stayed within his own territory"").
*   **D) Ambitious counsel without mighty help is useless:** The Pike acted alone; there was no ""counsel"" mentioned.
*   **E) True leadership is not just about appearance:** While appearance is mentioned, the core conflict is about overextension and lack of contentment.

The most traditional and accurate moral for this specific fable (a variation of Aesop's themes) is to be satisfied with one's own sphere of influence and current blessings.

As soon as the ro,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Event:** Two soldiers encounter a robber. One flees (showing cowardice), while the other stays and fights (showing bravery).
2.  **The Aftermath:** Once the danger has passed, the coward returns, brandishing his weapon and making bold, aggressive claims about what he would have done to the robber.
3.  **The Confrontation:** The brave soldier rebukes him, pointing out that his words are ""useless"" because they were not backed up by action when it mattered. He emphasizes that the coward's true nature was revealed by his flight.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) Courage in words means nothing if you flee in danger:** This directly addresses the contrast between the coward's boastful speech and his actual behavior during the crisis.
*   **B) There is little risk in being poor...:** This is irrelevant to the story.
*   **C) Bravery outshines cowardice:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific lesson about the emptiness of boastful words after the fact.
*   **D) Know your aggressive, unreliable enemies:** The coward is a companion, not the enemy (the robber).
*   **E) Courage in adversity reveals true character:** This is a strong theme, but the story's climax focuses specifically on the soldier’s rejection of the coward’s empty boasts.

The core lesson is that ""bragging"" or ""talking tough"" after a crisis cannot hide the fact that one failed to act when danger was present. Option A most precisely targets the dialogue and the specific hypocrisy presented in the fable.

1.  **The Situation:** The Eagle (the king of birds) grants the Hoopoe a seat of honor at a wedding.
2.  **The Reason for Honor:** The Hoopoe is chosen because of its ""crown"" and ""multicolored feathers""—purely aesthetic and outward physical traits.
3.  **The Reality/Irony:** Despite its beautiful appearance, the Hoopoe's actual habits and character involve ""rolling around in dung and filth.""
4.  **The Conflict:** The other birds resent this because they recognize that the Hoopoe's status is based on superficial beauty rather than its actual behavior or ""character.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) True worth should be measured by character and deeds, not by outward appearances.** This aligns perfectly with the story. The Hoopoe looks like royalty but lives filthily; the fable highlights the error in judging or honoring someone based solely on their ""feathers"" (appearances).
*   **B)** This is the moral of ""The Eagle and the Beetle,"" which is not the story provided here.
*   **C)** While resentment is mentioned, the story focuses more on the *reason* for the resentment (undeserved status based on looks).
*   **D)** This is a variation of a moral from ""The Lion and the Mouse.""
*   **E)** The story actually highlights a failure of judgment in a hierarchy rather than the benefits of inclusivity.

The story teaches that a beautiful exterior can hide a foul nature, and true honor should be reserved for those whose actions match their appearance.

They w",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A hen (a creature typically associated with nurturing/motherhood) finds snake eggs. Instead of leaving them or destroying them, she treats them as her own, brooding over them to help them hatch.
2.  **The Nature of the Subject:** Snakes are natural predators and inherently dangerous (""wicked"" or ""malicious"" in the context of fables). By nurturing them, the hen is ensuring the survival of creatures that will naturally prey upon her and others.
3.  **The Warning:** A swallow observes this and highlights the hen's folly. The swallow points out that by helping the enemy survive and grow, the hen is creating the instrument of her own destruction.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that kindness or devotion shown to the inherently malicious or ""wicked"" does not change their nature; it only empowers them to harm their benefactor. It is a warning against misplaced trust and the foolishness of assisting those who are inherently dangerous.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses the danger of trusting or helping ""wicked"" (harmful) individuals, even if they currently seem harmless (as eggs).
*   **B** refers to greed (associated with *The Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs*).
*   **C** is the opposite of the story's outcome.
*   **D** refers to hubris or envy (associated with *The Frog and the Ox*).
*   **E** suggests the hen's actions were positive, which the fable warns against.

This fable is attributed to Aesop (often titled ""The Hen and the Swallow"" or ""The Hen and the Snake-eggs""). Its traditional moral is that a wicked nature cannot be changed by kindness and that one who fosters evil will be its first victim.

The jackdaw, however, could not stand to live in human society, so w",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events:
1.  **The Context:** A jackdaw is captured and kept as a pet (a ""slave in human society"").
2.  **The Action:** Desiring freedom above all else, the bird escapes the moment it has an opportunity.
3.  **The Outcome:** Because it carries the ""baggage"" of its captivity (the string), its attempt to return to its natural habitat leads to its death.
4.  **The Realization:** The bird recognizes that its own dissatisfaction with its condition led to a choice that resulted in disaster.

Looking at the options:
- **B, C, and D** are irrelevant to the specific plot points of this jackdaw fable.
- **E** focuses on the perspective of the children or the man, but the fable concludes with the bird's internal realization about its own state of mind and the consequences of its flight.
- **A** reflects the classic interpretation of this Aesop's fable. The jackdaw could have survived in the house, but its ""mind"" (its inability to tolerate the condition) led it to seek a freedom that, under those specific circumstances, became a death trap. It suggests that our internal reaction to our circumstances often dictates our fate more than the circumstances themselves.

In many classical collections, this fable (The Jackdaw and the String) is used to illustrate that in seeking to improve our condition out of discontent, we often run into worse perils. Option A best encapsulates the theme of the mind's role in one's situation.

'Be careful, my friends,' he said, 'what if we all drown before the me",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict**: Sailors are in a life-threatening situation (a storm) and are wasting time and effort by directing their pleas to intermediaries (various saints).
2.  **The Sailor's Insight**: He points out the inefficiency of using middlemen in an emergency. He suggests that by the time the message passes through an intermediary to the ultimate authority, it might be too late.
3.  **The Solution**: He advises going ""directly to the one who can save us without any help."" This represents taking the most direct route to the source of power or the solution.
4.  **The Result**: By simplifying their approach and going straight to the source, the situation is resolved.

**Evaluation of Options**:
*   **A) The shortest and surest way of doing things is best.** This aligns perfectly with the sailor’s logic: skip the intermediaries and go straight to the source to ensure the quickest and most certain result.
*   **B) It is better to be loved than feared.** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C) Mercy tempers power.** While the calming of the storm could be seen as mercy, the story focuses on the *method* of the prayer, not the nature of the deity.
*   **D) Not all pragmatic advice is diverse or wise.** Usually, fables promote the pragmatic advice given by the protagonist; in this case, the sailor's advice *is* wise.
*   **E) Urgency in communication is vital.** While urgency is a factor, the core lesson is about the *efficiency* of the path taken (direct vs. indirect).

The fable (traditionally attributed to Aesop or found in similar collections like those of La Fontaine or L'Estrange) emphasizes that directness is the most effective policy.

The mice who lived in the house were always being hunted down by either the snake or the weasel, so when they saw the snake and the ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the plot step-by-step:

1.  **The Context:** Two natural predators (the snake and the weasel) are engaged in a conflict.
2.  **The Mistake:** The mice, who are the natural prey of both parties, interpret this conflict as a moment of safety or an opportunity to roam freely. They let their guard down.
3.  **The Outcome:** The moment the predators notice the vulnerable third party (the mice), they set aside their internal dispute to exploit the easier target.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This is a strong contender, as the mice are bystanders to the main fight but end up being the victims when they interfere/emerge.
*   **B:** While the mice misread the situation, the story is more specifically about the danger of getting caught between rivals.
*   **C:** The mice are not aggressive, but they certainly don't outwit the predators.
*   **D:** This choice explores the idea that when larger powers are at war, the ""weak"" are never truly safe and must remain on guard because those powers can easily unite against a common, easy target. Historically, in Aesop's fables, this specific story (Perry Index 193) is used to illustrate that those who intervene or expose themselves during the conflicts of the powerful often become the victims themselves. However, the most accurate traditional moral associated with this specific fable is that those who get involved in the quarrels of others—or think they are safe because their enemies are distracted—often find those enemies uniting against them.
*   **E:** This describes the setting but not the lesson.

Looking closely at the options provided, **A** most accurately reflects the transition of the mice from ""safe observers"" to ""targets"" because they misjudged the danger of the two powerful parties. 

However, in many classical translations of this specific fable, the moral is phrased as: ""In the quarrels of the powerful, the weak are often the victims,"" or ""When you see your enemies fighting, do not think you are safe."" Option **A** captures the essence that bystanders (the mice) suffer when they miscalculate the behavior of powerful conflicting parties.

'Well!' said the Boy, 'you'll regret it, because you'll never be as well cared for any",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the dialogue and the situation:

1.  **The Situation**: A goldfinch has escaped captivity (the cage). The master (the Boy) attempts to lure the bird back by highlighting the comfort and safety of being ""cared for.""
2.  **The Conflict**: The Boy argues that the bird is making a mistake because it will lose its security and physical well-being.
3.  **The Resolution**: The Bird acknowledges that life might be harder or less ""well-cared for"" on its own, but explicitly states that independence and the ability to ""take care of myself"" are more valuable than the comforts of the cage.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) There is no wealth greater than liberty.** This fits perfectly. The bird views its freedom as more valuable than the ""wealth"" of food and shelter provided by the master.
*   **B) Treat bad/good people differently.** Irrelevant to the text.
*   **C) Defiance can mask true concern.** This focuses on the Boy, but the fable's weight is on the Bird's choice.
*   **D) Changing location and state of mind.** This is a variation of ""Caelum non animum mutant,"" which doesn't apply here because the bird's state of mind is exactly why it changed location.
*   **E) Freedom is worth pursuing at great risk.** While similar to A, the text focuses more on the *value* of self-sufficiency versus the *value* of being provided for, rather than the ""risk"" or ""pursuit"" aspect.

The core of the fable is the trade-off between security and freedom, asserting that freedom is the higher prize.

The mole said to them, 'Silence your complaining, since you can see that I am deprived of eyes.'",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the interaction between the characters:

1.  **The Characters' Plights:** The donkey and the monkey are focused on minor physical deficiencies—a lack of horns and a tail. These are aesthetic or non-essential features compared to basic survival senses.
2.  **The Mole's Intervention:** The mole interrupts them to point out that she lacks eyes (sight), which is a much more significant deprivation than the lack of horns or a tail. 
3.  **The Lesson:** By pointing out a greater misfortune, the mole encourages the others to gain perspective. The implication is that if we look at those who are worse off than ourselves, our own problems seem smaller and more manageable.

Analyzing the options:
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the mole’s message: seeing someone with a greater misfortune (blindness) makes the minor misfortunes (no horns/tail) easier to bear.
*   **B)** This is the moral of a different fable (like ""The Horse and the Loaded Donkey"").
*   **C)** While true in life, the focus here is on the *comparison* of misfortunes, not the futility of the act of complaining itself.
*   **D)** This refers to karma or reciprocity, which is not present here.
*   **E)** The characters aren't necessarily coveting what others have so much as lamenting what they lack.

The traditional moral associated with this Aesopic fable is that we should be content with our lot when we see others who are less fortunate.

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The Fox plays a trick on the Crane by serving food in a flat dish that the Crane's long beak cannot handle. This is an act of unkindness and lack of consideration.
2.  **The Result:** The Fox finds amusement in the Crane's struggle.
3.  **The Crane's Reaction:** The Crane retaliates by doing the exact same thing to the Fox—serving food in a vessel (a long-necked flagon) that the Fox cannot access, while the Crane can.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The story ends by stating the Fox met with a ""fitting requital"" (repayment/retribution) based on the ""fashion of her own hospitality.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Do unto others what you would have them do unto you:** This is the ""Golden Rule."" The story illustrates the consequences of violating this rule: if you treat others poorly, you should expect to be treated poorly in return.
*   **B) Beware the sort of person who uses tricks:** While true, the story focuses more on the circular nature of the behavior rather than a simple warning against tricksters.
*   **C) Cleverness can outwit vexation:** This describes the Crane's specific action, but not the overarching universal lesson.
*   **D) A clever alliance with the powerless is futile:** This does not apply to the narrative.
*   **E) Consideration for others' needs fosters true hospitality:** While the story shows the *absence* of this, the primary focus is the ""tit-for-tat"" repayment the Fox receives.

1.  **The Situation:** A man notices that his wife is disliked by everyone in his household. He suspects her personality is the cause but wants to confirm if she behaves the same way elsewhere.
2.  **The Test:** He sends her to her father’s house. This is a smaller ""sample size"" of her social interactions.
3.  **The Evidence:** Upon her return, she complains that even the shepherds and herdsmen—people who are outdoors working all day and barely interact with the household—looked at her with ""aversion.""
4.  **The Conclusion:** The husband concludes that if people who barely saw her (the ""straws"" or small indicators) disliked her, then the people she spent all day with must have detested her even more.
5.  **The Lesson:** Small signs or instances (how she was treated by those she saw briefly) indicate the larger truth of her character and how she is perceived by everyone else.

The proverb **""Straws show how the wind blows""** means that small signs or insignificant incidents often indicate a larger trend or the general state of affairs. In this case, the reaction of the shepherds (the straw) revealed the nature of her character and her general reputation (the wind).

- Option B is about suitability, which isn't the focus.
- Option C and D discuss curiosity or friendship, but the husband's curiosity was to prove a point about her character, not to find a friend.
- Option E is a modern takeaway, but fables usually focus on a specific observation of human nature rather than a prescriptive ""how-to"" for marriage.

The traditional moral for this specific Aesop's fable is that small indicators reveal the larger reality.

1.  **Analyze the Characters and Action:** The story features a coachman and a creaking wheel. The coachman notices that the wheel making the noise is the ""worst wheel of the whole set.""
2.  **Evaluate the ""Complaint"":** The creaking sound is a metaphor for complaining or drawing attention to oneself. The fable highlights that the wheel that is most defective (the weakest/worst) is the one making the most noise.
3.  **Identify the Core Theme:** The story suggests that those who contribute the least or are in the worst condition are often the ones who complain the loudest or most frequently. 
4.  **Match with Options:**
    *   **A) Complaining is the privilege of the weak:** This captures the irony that the ""worst"" wheel is the one ""taking the liberty"" to complain/creak. In various versions of Aesop's fables (such as ""The Creaking Wheels""), the moral is often stated as: ""Those who do the least work often groan the loudest"" or that the weak/defective seek attention through noise.
    *   **B, C, D:** These do not relate to the relationship between the quality of the wheel and the noise it makes.
    *   **E) Noise often masks vulnerability:** While close, the fable emphasizes the *audacity* of the weak to complain, rather than the noise being a mask.

Option A is the traditional interpretation of this specific fable (often titled ""The Creaking Wheel""). It points out that those who are most problematic or least efficient are the most likely to complain.

The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, 'I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you'd gone right",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the components of the fable:

1.  **The Event**: A woman breaks a jar.
2.  **The Conflict**: The jar (personified) seeks justice by finding a witness and taking the matter to a legal/argumentative level (a ""court-case"").
3.  **The Woman's Response**: She scolds the jar, telling it that it would have been ""wiser"" to seek a bandage (a functional, practical repair) rather than a witness (a legal/argumentative victory).

**Analysis of the Lessons:**
*   The woman's point is that the jar is still broken. Winning a court case or proving she was at fault does not fix the physical damage. 
*   **A) Action is more valuable than arguments**: This fits perfectly. Seeking a ""bandage"" is a restorative action; seeking a ""witness"" is a vanity of argument that leaves the primary problem (the break) unsolved.
*   **B) You can't please everybody**: Not relevant to the context of repair vs. litigation.
*   **C) Practicality triumphs over sarcasm**: The woman *is* being sarcastic, and the jar is the one being impractical. The lesson isn't about sarcasm; it's about the futility of litigation over repair.
*   **D) Practical fortune...**: This is a complex phrasing that doesn't align with the simple ""repair over blame"" theme.
*   **E) Small actions reveal hidden strengths**: There is no display of strength here, only a debate over how to handle a mishap.

The fable teaches that when something goes wrong, one should focus on fixing the problem (action/bandage) rather than assigning blame or winning an argument (litigation/witness).

morables_506,"The dolphins and Whales waged a fierce war with each other. When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative elements:

1.  **The Situation**: Two powerful groups (Dolphins and Whales) are engaged in a major conflict.
2.  **The Intervention**: A Sprat (a very small, insignificant fish) offers to mediate and settle the dispute.
3.  **The Reaction**: The Dolphins reject the help immediately. They state they would rather continue their destructive war than let someone they consider inferior or insignificant interfere in their business.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) Some would rather fight than not**: This is partially true in the context of the story, but it misses the specific nuance regarding the ""umpire"" (the Sprat).
*   **B) Those who adapt...**: This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C) Pride often leads to unnecessary conflict**: While pride is present, the story specifically highlights that the ""proud"" characters would rather perish than accept help from those they deem ""unworthy.""
*   **D) Every fierce, proud man for himself**: This doesn't fit the communal nature of the war or the rejection of the mediator.
*   **E) Conflict among kin...**: While true for some fables, the specific punchline here is the rejection of the Sprat's help due to his low status.

Historically, this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat"") carries the moral that **insignificant people who try to meddle in the affairs of the powerful are often held in contempt.** In many classical translations, the moral is summarized as: ""Many people who are of no account in themselves, when they happen to find a state in a civil war, think they are someone."" 

Looking at the provided options, **C** is the closest fit. The Dolphins' pride is so great that they choose potential destruction over the perceived humiliation of accepting a ""lesser"" being's mediation. Their pride maintains an unnecessary and destructive conflict.

One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them. When th",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation:** A Man and a Satyr form an alliance (a friendship or bond).
2.  **The First Action:** The Man blows on his hands to **warm** them.
3.  **The Second Action:** The Man blows on his food to **cool** it.
4.  **The Satyr’s Reaction:** The Satyr is disturbed by the inconsistency. He perceives the Man as ""double-tongued"" or inconsistent because he uses the same instrument (his breath) for two diametrically opposed purposes (heating and cooling).
5.  **The Lesson:** This fable (one of Aesop's) uses the physical act of blowing ""hot and cold"" as a metaphor for human character. It warns against people who are inconsistent, hypocritical, or who shift their positions to suit the moment. A person who can argue for both sides of an issue with equal fervor—or who changes their ""temperature"" depending on who they are with—is seen as unreliable and untrustworthy.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the metaphor of ""blowing hot and cold"" and the subsequent loss of trust.
*   **B:** Irrelevant to the story's events.
*   **C:** While the man is technically being ""adaptable,"" the story portrays this as a negative trait (inconsistency/duplicity) rather than a positive path to success.
*   **D:** Too complex and focuses on ""vices,"" which doesn't fit the simplicity of the breath metaphor.
*   **E:** This is a general truth, but not the specific moral traditionally associated with this Aesop fable.

The phrase ""to blow hot and cold"" remains a common idiom today meaning to be vacillating or to change one's mind constantly. Therefore, the Satyr rejects the Man because he cannot trust someone so inconsistent.

morables_173,"Socrates had erected for himself a very modest house - and I myself would even be willing to die as Socrates died if I could achieve an equal fame, yes, I would be willing to suffer the same public di",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the context:

1.  **The Context:** The story describes Socrates building a very small, modest house. A neighbor questions why a man of his stature would live in such a cramped space.
2.  **The Response:** Socrates replies, ""If only I could fill it with true friends!"" 
3.  **The Meaning:** By saying he wishes he could fill even a ""tiny little house"" with true friends, Socrates is implying that ""true friends"" are so rare that he would struggle to find enough of them to occupy even a small space. He is prioritizing the quality and rarity of friendship over the physical size of his home.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) True friends are hard to find:** This aligns perfectly with Socrates' implication that even a tiny house might be too big for the number of genuine friends one can acquire in a lifetime.
*   **B) No curse weighs more heavily than a guilty conscience:** This is a separate moral concept not addressed in the text.
*   **C) Curiosity fuels wisdom:** While the neighbor is curious, the focus of the fable is on Socrates' witty retort regarding friendship, not the neighbor's quest for knowledge.
*   **D) Do not play the modest...:** This is a criticism of the narrator or the behavior, but not the lesson of the anecdote itself.
*   **E) True greatness often requires enduring present hardships...:** While the narrator mentions dying for fame and vindication, the core of the specific fable (the interaction about the house) is about the scarcity of true friends.

The fable (originally by Phaedrus) is a classic illustration of the rarity of authentic friendship.

Admittedly, Prometheus had made the lion very large and handsome, supplying him with sharp fangs in his jaw and arming him w",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative arc:

1.  **The Conflict:** The lion is powerful and majestic, yet he is deeply insecure and suicidal because he has one specific, irrational fear: roosters. He blames his creator for this perceived flaw.
2.  **The Encounter:** The lion meets the elephant, an animal even larger than himself. He discovers that the elephant—despite his massive size—lives in terror of a tiny gnat.
3.  **The Resolution:** The lion realizes that if a creature as grand as an elephant is bothered by something as small as a gnat, his own fear of a rooster is relatively minor. He stops wanting to die and accepts his condition.
4.  **The Lesson:** The lion finds comfort and perspective by seeing that even the most powerful creatures have weaknesses, and that his situation is actually better than that of others.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) There is always someone else worse off than you:** This aligns perfectly with the lion's conclusion (""I am... in much better shape than this elephant""). He gains perspective by comparing his struggle to another's.
*   **B) No matter how you brag, you can be undone:** The lion wasn't bragging; he was lamenting.
*   **C) Strength alone does not guarantee invulnerability:** While true in the story, the ""moral"" focuses on the lion's change in perspective regarding his own misery, rather than a warning about vulnerability.
*   **D) You may share the labours... but not the spoil:** This is the moral of ""The Lion's Share,"" not this fable.
*   **E) Even divine gifts can spark envy:** This does not fit the lion's interaction with the elephant.

The fable teaches us to look at the troubles of others to gain perspective on our own, making A the most accurate moral.

morables_169,"The crow was making a sacrifice to Athena and invited a dog to the feast. The dog said to her, 'Why do you foolishly squander these sacrifices? The goddess clearly hates you so much that she has taken",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the interaction between the crow and the dog:

1.  **The Context**: In Greek mythology, the crow was traditionally seen as a bird of omen, but legendary lore (specifically myths regarding Athena or Apollo) often portrayed the crow as having its credibility stripped or being cursed for its talkativeness or bad news.
2.  **The Dog's Argument**: The dog points out that the crow is wasting resources on Athena, a goddess who has already rejected the crow and rendered its prophetic powers useless. This represents a pragmatic, cynical view.
3.  **The Crow's Logic**: The crow explains that its devotion is not a result of a current good relationship, but a strategic attempt to *change* a bad relationship. The crow is consciously attempting to appease an adversary (Athena) to regain favor or status.
4.  **The Moral**: The story illustrates a specific human behavior: being particularly kind or sacrificial toward those who dislike us or treat us poorly, specifically with the ulterior motive of winning them over or mitigating their hostility.

**Evaluation of options:**
- **A**: This aligns perfectly with the crow's strategy of sacrificing specifically to an ""enemy"" (Athena) to gain her favor.
- **B**: The story isn't about choosing enemies, but dealing with existing ones.
- **C**: While ""hope"" is mentioned, the fable is more about the transactional and calculated nature of the sacrifice rather than pure optimism.
- **D**: This suggests the opposite of the crow's behavior (the crow lacks the ""critical means"" because its omens are already discredited).
- **E**: The dog and crow do not become friends; the focus is on the crow's relationship with the goddess.

In classical collections of Aesop's fables (such as the Perry Index), the moral translated for this specific fable is often: *Many people do not hesitate to do favors for their enemies, in the hope of winning their friendship.*

morables_418,"They say that the hyena has a double nature: for a period of time the hyena is male, and then later on she is female. The story goes that when a male hyena was treating a female badly, she said to him",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"In this fable, often attributed to Aesop, the central theme is the reversal of roles. Because the hyena is portrayed as changing its sex periodically, the female hyena warns her current oppressor (the male) that their positions will eventually switch. The core lesson is that those who hold power or authority today should treat others well, because the tables may turn, and the person being mistreated may one day hold power over their current superior.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. **The Context:** The story describes a cycle where the subject changes its identity/role (from male to female and back).
2. **The Conflict:** A male hyena is mistreating a female hyena.
3. **The Warning:** The female reminds the male that their roles are temporary and will soon be reversed.
4. **The Moral Application:** This is a metaphor for social or professional roles. Someone who is currently a subordinate (a student or someone being judged) may later become the superior (the teacher or the judge). Therefore, one should not abuse their current position of power.

Option **A** captures this sentiment: someone who is currently subject to another's judgment or authority can later inhabit the role of the judge or teacher.

The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the source of the conflict:

1.  **The Alliance:** The lion and the dolphin form an alliance based on their status (kings of their respective realms). This seems logical in theory but ignores practical geography.
2.  **The Crisis:** The lion enters a battle on land (his domain) and calls for the dolphin's help.
3.  **The Limitation:** The dolphin *wants* to help but is physically incapable because his nature binds him to the sea.
4.  **The Lesson:** The lion feels betrayed, but the dolphin points out that no amount of goodwill can overcome natural limitations.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **B** refers to betrayal and bad intent, but the dolphin did not *want* to betray the lion; he was physically unable to help.
*   **C and D** focus on ""regal"" and ""might"" but miss the functional point of why the alliance failed.
*   **E** is a modern interpretation, but traditional fables like Aesop’s (this is ""The Lion and the Dolphin"") focus on the practical necessity of a friend's ability to act.
*   **A** directly addresses the failure of the alliance: the lion chose a friend who, despite being powerful, could not provide assistance in the specific location where the lion faced peril. The primary lesson of this specific fable is that when choosing allies, one must consider whether they are actually capable of helping when needed.

The fox then ask",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the concluding dialogue:

1.  **The Situation:** A fox attempts to trick a cicada into coming down from a tree to eat it.
2.  **The Response:** The cicada tests the fox by dropping a leaf. When the fox pounces, the cicada realizes the fox's intentions were indeed predatory.
3.  **The Reasoning:** The cicada explains why he was suspicious: ""I've been on my guard against foxes ever since I saw the wings of a cicada in the spoor of a fox.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The cicada avoided becoming a victim because he observed what happened to others of his kind (seeing the wings/remains of another cicada in the fox's droppings). He learned from the misfortune of his ""neighbors"" or peers to protect himself.

Now let's look at the options:
*   **A) A discerning person is made wise by the misfortunes of his neighbours.** This matches the cicada's logic perfectly. He gained wisdom and safety by observing the tragic end of a fellow cicada.
*   **B) God is the ultimate judge.** Not relevant to the plot.
*   **C) Clever trickery breeds deception.** While trickery is present, the focus is on the cicada's protective wisdom, not the cycle of deception.
*   **D) Cautious fear... bring about the fate we seek to avoid.** This is the opposite of what happened; the cicada's caution *saved* him.
*   **E) Cunning plans often reveal true intentions.** While true, this is a subordinate point to the main theme of learning from observation.

This fable is traditionally attributed to Aesop, and the standard moral associated with it is that ""The misfortunes of others should be a warning to us."" Option A captures this precisely.

1.  **Analyze the Plot:** 
    *   The Mother Goat gives her Kid a warning to stay safe and not open the door to anyone.
    *   The Wolf (the antagonist) attempts to deceive the Kid by mimicking the Mother Goat's voice (hypocrisy/deception).
    *   The Kid verifies the visitor's identity visually through a window.
    *   The Kid recognizes the deception because, while the voice sounded right, the physical appearance (the true nature) of the Wolf was evident.

2.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A) A hypocrite can usually be found out:** This fits the narrative well. The Wolf acts as a hypocrite (pretending to be what he is not), but his disguise is imperfect and he is ""found out"" by the observant Kid.
    *   **B) Concern about demise:** This does not apply, as the Wolf isn't pretending to be concerned about the Kid's death; he is actively trying to cause it through trickery.
    *   **C) Caring hearts can see through counterfeit desires:** This is a bit too ""poetic."" The Kid sees through the trick using logic and observation, not necessarily a ""caring heart.""
    *   **D) No cautious arguments will give wise courage to the coward:** This doesn't apply; the Kid is not portrayed as a coward, but as a cautious and wise character.
    *   **E) Neglecting careful oversight can invite unforeseen perils:** This is the opposite of what happened. The Mother Goat provided *excellent* oversight/instructions, and the Kid followed them.

3.  **Conclusion:** The story is a classic example of a predator pretending to be a friend/parent to gain entry. The Kid uses observation to expose the Wolf's false persona. This aligns most closely with the idea that a hypocrite (someone pretending to be what they are not) can be detected if one looks closely.

Apollo immediately explained to the snake, 'If you had simply killed the first person who ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative:

1.  **The Situation:** A snake is being repeatedly stepped on by humans because it has not defended itself.
2.  **The Conflict:** The snake seeks guidance on its plight.
3.  **The Resolution/Advice:** Apollo points out that if the snake had retaliated against the *first* person who harmed it, it would have established a reputation or a deterrent. Because it allowed the first transgression to pass without consequence, others felt empowered to continue the mistreatment.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story is a metaphor for justice and deterrence. It suggests that if an initial transgression or crime is punished immediately and decisively, it serves as a warning to prevent others from following suit. In a societal or legal context, this aligns with the idea that swift punishment deters future offenders.

**Evaluating the choices:**
*   **A)** This directly mirrors Apollo's advice: punishing the first offender creates a deterrent for others.
*   **B)** This focuses on the delay of punishment for the wicked, which is not the primary focus of Apollo's advice to the victim.
*   **C)** This contradicts the story, which advocates for immediate (though defensive) action.
*   **D)** The story is about deterrence and consequence, not specifically ""cleverness"" vs ""force."" 
*   **E)** The temple is a setting for the dialogue, but the ""refuge"" is not the core lesson.

The moral is that an initial, swift punishment serves as a deterrent to future transgressions.

'I would agree,' the lion said, 'if you were not already in the habit of taking what",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interactions between the characters:

1.  **The Lion and the Robber:** The robber demands a portion of the kill with entitlement. The lion rejects him because the robber is already a ""villain"" accustomed to taking by force. This illustrates that aggression and entitlement meet resistance.
2.  **The Lion and the Wayfarer:** The wayfarer is modest and cautious, acknowledging the lion's power and making no demands. The lion recognizes this humility and rewards it with kindness and a share of the prize.
3.  **The Lesson:** The contrast between the two encounters highlights that one's attitude and character dictate how others treat them. People who demand things through force or perceived right are rebuffed, whereas those who are modest and respectful often receive unsolicited generosity.

Let's look at the options:
- **A** captures the duality of the story perfectly.
- **B** focuses on betrayal, which is not the central theme here.
- **C** suggests the man tamed the lion, but the lion was already portrayed as a moral judge rather than a mindless beast in need of taming.

Since he was constantly paying out money and spending great sums on the offerings, the god came to him one night and said: 'L",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the dialogue:

1.  **The Action:** A man is voluntarily spending large sums of money on religious sacrifices at a hero shrine.
2.  **The Consequence:** He is essentially ""spending everything"" and risking poverty through his own excessive decisions.
3.  **The Warning:** The god intervenes specifically to tell the man to stop ""squandering"" his wealth.
4.  **The Reason for the Warning:** The god points out that if the man becomes poor due to his own actions, he will likely turn around and blame the god/shrine for his misfortune rather than his own lack of moderation.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the god's statement. The man is being foolish (squandering his wealth), and the god is preemptively addressing the human tendency to shift blame for self-inflicted struggles onto divine or external forces.
*   **B)** The story is not about broken promises.
*   **C)** While the man is extravagant, the core lesson focuses on the eventual blame-shifting associated with that extravagance.
*   **D)** The man isn’t necessarily seeking profit; he seems to be seeking favor or showing devotion, but doing so in an unsustainable way.
*   **E)** While a modern reader might see this, the fable's internal logic is specifically about the irony of blaming the gods for poverty caused by over-spending on those very gods.

The lesson is that people often create their own problems through foolish behavior and then look for someone else (in this case, the hero or god) to blame.

When he saw the reflection of his body in the water, he disparaged the slenderness of his legs but revelled in the shape and",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Comparison:** The stag looks at himself and makes a value judgment. He finds his legs (which are functional) ""slender"" and unattractive, while he finds his horns (which are decorative/aesthetic) impressive and superior.
2.  **The Conflict:** When the hunters arrive, the stag’s legs—the part of him he despised—actually provide the means for his escape and safety.
3.  **The Downfall:** The stag’s horns—the part of him he took pride in—become a physical hindrance, tangling in the branches and leading to his capture.
4.  **The Realization:** In his final moments, the stag explicitly states the lesson: the thing he underrated (his legs) was actually his salvation, and the thing he boasted about (his horns) was his destruction.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) What is most truly valuable is often underrated:** This directly matches the stag's realization. He undervalued his legs, which were his most valuable asset for survival.
*   **B) It is often the case that people are greedy...:** While the stag's pride led to his downfall, ""greed"" is not the primary theme; it is a lack of appreciation for utility vs. beauty.
*   **C) Persistence outshines vanity:** The story is not about persistence; the hunters caught him due to a physical entanglement, not because they tried harder.
*   **D) Vain deceivers...:** There are no ""deceivers"" in this story.
*   **E) Pride in appearances can blind us to our true strengths:** This is a strong candidate, but **A** is the classical interpretation of this specific Aesop's fable (*The Stag at the Pool*). The fable focuses specifically on the ""utility"" of the disregarded parts versus the ""danger"" of the prized parts.

Furious at ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and character dynamics:

1.  **The Conflict:** The story begins with a power imbalance. The Eagle, a large and powerful predator, ignores the plea of the small Beetle and treats her with physical disrespect (""tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away"").
2.  **The Action:** Despite being physically smaller and weaker, the Beetle finds a way to strike back at the Eagle by destroying what the Eagle values most: her eggs.
3.  **The Escalation:** Even when the Eagle seeks the highest protection (Jupiter), the Beetle utilizes its natural abilities (buzzing/annoyance) to achieve its goal of retribution.
4.  **The Resolution:** Jupiter acknowledges the Beetle's ""justice."" The story concludes that even the most powerful creatures (the Eagle) are not immune to the consequences of mistreating those they perceive as weak.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) The weak may find a way to avenge a wrong:** This aligns perfectly with the Beetle (the weak) successfully avenging the Eagle's disrespect and the death of the Hare.
*   **B) Greed resulting in death:** There is no theme of greed in this story; it is about revenge and justice.
*   **C) Power lies in restraint:** While the Eagle lacked restraint, the core focus is on the Beetle's successful retaliation.
*   **D) Beauty and leadership:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) Compassion bridging the divide:** The story is about the *lack* of compassion and the subsequent vengeance, not a successful bridge between the two.

The moral is that even the most powerful should not mistreat the weak, as the weak can still find ways to retaliate.

morables_488,"A merchant who owned a donkey heard that salt was cheaper by the seashore, so he decided to go into the salt business. He went and loaded his donkey with salt and then headed back home. At a certain m",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the progression of events:

1.  **The Accident:** The donkey accidentally falls, the salt dissolves, and the load becomes lighter. This is a stroke of luck.
2.  **The Deception:** The donkey attempts to recreate the ""accident"" on purpose to avoid work. He successfully fools the merchant once.
3.  **The Discovery:** The merchant is observant and realizes he is being manipulated by the donkey's trickery.
4.  **The Consequence:** The merchant changes the cargo to sponges. When the donkey tries the same trick again, his plan backfires because he did not account for the merchant's awareness. Instead of a lighter load, he receives a much heavier one.

**Step-by-step evaluation of the options:**
*   **A) You can fool someone only so many times.** This aligns perfectly with the narrative. The donkey's trick worked initially, but once the merchant caught on, the trickery led to his downfall.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you...** This is irrelevant to the plot, which focuses on labor and deception.
*   **C) Cunning minds see wicked traps.** While the merchant was clever, the story is primarily a warning against the deceiver, not a tribute to the merchant's ""wicked traps.""
*   **D) Everyone should be satisfied...** This is overly wordy and pessimistic; the story specifically punishes dishonesty, not general existence.
*   **E) Sometimes, accidents can lighten the load...** This describes the inciting incident but misses the ""moral"" or the lesson learned from the donkey's subsequent failure.

The core lesson is that a trick used to avoid duty will eventually be discovered, and the deceiver will suffer the consequences.

Even after stroking the animal he was not sure of its i,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Premise:** A blind man has a heightened sense of touch and discernment for identifying animals.
2.  **The Object:** He is presented with a wolf cub, a predatory animal at its earliest stage of development.
3.  **The Observation:** Although the man cannot definitively name the species (wolf vs. fox), he immediately senses the inherent nature of the creature.
4.  **The Conclusion:** He recognizes that the animal possesses a disposition or character—even as a baby—that makes it a threat to sheep. He identifies its ""predatory nature"" before it has even grown up or committed an act of violence.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Evil tendencies are shown in early life:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The cub is small and hasn't killed anything yet, but the man feels its ""wolfish"" nature and warns against it based on its innate character.
*   **B) Harsh means/Reason:** Not applicable; there is no conflict resolution or discipline in the story.
*   **C) Appearances can be misleading:** In this case, the man is blind, so he isn't judging by appearance at all. The story is about *nature* rather than *looks*.
*   **D) Reward and punishment:** There is no reward or punishment mentioned.
*   **E) Familiarity:** The wolf cub is not ""familiar"" to the man in a way that conceals truth; rather, his lack of sight allows him to perceive the truth more clearly.

Aesop's Fables often use animals to represent human traits. This specific fable (frequently titled ""The Blind Man and the Wolf Cub"") is traditionally used to illustrate that a character's ""wicked"" or dangerous nature is discernible from the very beginning.

This man noticed that all sorts of people came to him, and he became curious to see who were true friend",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"The story describes a man who uses a ruse to differentiate between those who visit him for his food (freeloaders) and those who are loyal to him as a person (true friends).

1.  **Analyze the context:** The rich man provides a benefit (generosity/food) that attracts many people.
2.  **Analyze the conflict:** He sets up a fake scenario involving danger and sacrifice—a ""quarrel"" requiring ""swords in hand.""
3.  **Analyze the outcome:** The vast majority of the guests—who were happy to eat his food—made excuses when asked to face risk. Only two remained.
4.  **Evaluate the themes:** While the story touches on generosity and the behavior of freeloaders, the primary focus is the **rarity of loyal friendship**. Out of a ""full table"" of guests, only two were genuine.

**Reviewing the options:**
*   **A** highlights the scarcity of genuine friends, which is the direct result of the man's test.
*   **B** is irrelevant to this specific story.
*   **C** is a possible piece of advice, but the story is more an observation of human nature than a critique of the man's initial generosity.
*   **D** describes the hangers-on, but isn't the overarching ""moral"" as much as it is a description of the antagonists.
*   **E** is a strong thematic statement, but many classic interpretations of this specific fable (a variation of the ""Test of Friendship"") focus on the scarcity of those who remain when the ""table is empty"" or when danger arises.

Option **A** is the most direct and classic moral for this fable.

The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, 'Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch m",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the core conflict:

1.  **The Characters:** There are two pots—one made of brass (strong/tough) and one made of earthenware (fragile/brittle).
2.  **The Context:** They are both being carried by a river, meaning they are in a dynamic, unpredictable environment where they might collide.
3.  **The Interaction:** The earthenware pot asks for distance. It recognizes that while a collision wouldn't hurt the brass pot, it would be fatal for the earthenware one. 
4.  **The Lesson:** The danger lies in the inequality of their strength. If the fragile associates with the powerful, the fragile risks destruction even if the powerful means no harm. Therefore, true security and friendship are found among those who are similar in status or strength.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Equals make the best friends:** This aligns perfectly with Aesop's original moral. It suggests that a partnership between the weak and the strong is inherently dangerous for the weak.
*   **B), C), D), E):** These either misinterpret the power dynamic or apply modern ""self-worth"" sentiments that do not fit the traditional cautionary nature of this fable.

The fable teaches that an unequal power dynamic is dangerous for the more vulnerable party.

The wild boar replied, 'I have",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,0,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions and dialogue of the characters:

1.  **The Action:** The wild boar is sharpening his tusks even though there is no current enemy or immediate threat.
2.  **The Question:** The fox questions the utility of this work, implying it is unnecessary labor during a time of peace.
3.  **The Reasoning:** The boar explains that once danger actually arrives, it will be too late to prepare; he must be ready beforehand so he can act immediately.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story emphasizes the importance of readiness and foresight. It teaches that one should prepare for adversity during times of safety.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace:** This aligns with the concept of ""being ready for danger before it arrives."" While the boar's focus is on defense/combat readiness, this is the classic interpretation of this Aesop's fable (often summarized as ""Prepare in times of peace for the needs of war"").
*   **B) God is the ultimate judge:** Irrelevant to the text.
*   **C) Curiosity must be guided by prudence:** This focuses on the fox, but the fox is merely a foil for the boar's wisdom.
*   **D) Prudent men feel worst when...:** Irrelevant to the text.
*   **E) Even nature prepares its own defenses:** While true, the fable is a metaphor for human behavior and planning, making A a more precise ""moral"" or lesson.

When the depositor then summoned him to swear an oath regarding the deposit, he realized the danger he was in and prepar",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Crime and Deception:** A man intends to embezzle a deposit from a friend. To do so, he must lie under oath.
2.  **The Encounter:** He meets the personification of Oath, who claims he only revisits cities every 30 or 40 years to punish the wicked. 
3.  **The False Security:** Relying on this timeline, the man feels safe to commit perjury immediately, believing his punishment is decades away.
4.  **The Punishment:** He is caught and punished by Oath the very next day. 
5.  **The Lesson:** Oath explains that while he may take a long time to return for some, he can return instantly for those who intentionally provoke him or treat his justice with contempt.

The story highlights that divine retribution or the ""payday"" for wickedness is unpredictable. One cannot ""schedule"" their misdeeds based on an assumption of when they will be caught; punishment for wrongdoing can happen at any moment.

Looking at the options:
- **A** directly reflects the unpredictability of justice and punishment shown in the ending.
- **B** is unrelated to the plot.
- **C** is a philosophical abstraction not supported by the dialogue.
- **D** discusses inciting strife, which isn't the primary theme.
- **E** focuses on conscience, whereas the story focuses on the external arrival of punishment (the god Oath).

Option A accurately captures the subversion of the man's expectations regarding the timing of his punishment.

The brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their feathers, whe",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the progression of the plot:

1.  **The First Threat:** The farmer asks his neighbors for help. The mother Lark is not worried because she knows that depending on others often leads to delay or inaction. If the farmer isn't doing the work himself, he isn't truly ready to start.
2.  **The Second Threat:** The farmer decides to hire laborers and do the work himself. The mother Lark realizes the danger is now real because the farmer has taken personal responsibility for the task.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that a task is only certain to be completed when the person responsible for it decides to do it themselves rather than relying on the charity or assistance of others.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Self-help is the best help:** This directly aligns with the mother Lark's observation. When the farmer stops waiting for neighbors and takes action himself, the work gets done.
*   **B) Cunning often outwits itself:** This does not apply, as there is no ""cunning"" character being tricked.
*   **C) Wisdom grows with determination:** While determination is present, the specific lesson is about self-reliance versus relying on others.
*   **D) The Golden Rule:** This is about morality/ethics toward others, not personal productivity or self-reliance.
*   **E) Nature's promise:** This is a poetic sentiment but not the functional moral of the fable.

As soon as he realized what was going on, Aesop -- who w",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's break down the metaphor used by Aesop:

1.  **The Situation:** Aesop is playing children's games (marbles). An observer judges him, assuming that a serious man should not engage in play and mistake his leisure for foolishness.
2.  **The Metaphor:** Aesop uses a bow to illustrate his point. A bow that is always under tension (tightly strung) will eventually lose its elasticity or snap. It becomes useless.
3.  **The Application:** The ""bow"" represents the human mind or spirit. The ""tension"" represents work, serious study, or the rigors of adult life. The ""unstrung"" state represents play and rest.
4.  **The Conclusion:** Aesop argues that by allowing himself moments of play and relaxation (unstringing the bow), he ensures that his mind remains strong and ready for serious work when needed. Without rest, the mind breaks.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) Resting the mind is essential for clear thinking:** This directly aligns with Aesop's explanation that the bow must rest to be ""ready to use whenever you need it.""
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for:** There is no wishing involved in this story.
*   **C) Mockery often masks confusion:** While the man was confused, the core lesson is about the necessity of play, not the nature of mockery.
*   **D) Be prepared to defend your position:** This describes the plot action, but it is not the universal life lesson (moral) intended by the dialogue.
*   **E) Wisdom often hides behind playful appearances:** While true in the context of Aesop, the specific lesson derived from the bow metaphor is about the functional necessity of rest, not the perception of wisdom.

Therefore, the primary lesson is that periods of recreation and rest are necessary to maintain one's mental strength and productivity.

'I breed only one,' said the lioness, 'but he is very ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the sow and the lioness:

1.  **The Characters' Arguments:** The sow is boasting about the **quantity** of her offspring (a ""whole litter""). She judges success by how many children she can produce at once. The lioness, in contrast, acknowledges that she only produces one, but emphasizes its **quality** (""very well bred"" or, in many translations, ""but he is a lion"").
2.  **The Contrast:** The fable creates a sharp contrast between having many common things (piglets) versus having one exceptional thing (a lion).
3.  **The Lesson:** The story suggests that the value of an achievement or a creation is not found in its volume or frequency, but in its excellence and character. 

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Quality is more valuable than quantity:** This directly reflects the lioness's retort. One lion is worth more than many pigs.
*   **B) Gossips are to be seen and not heard:** This does not fit the context of the sow's boast.
*   **C) Confidence without humility leads astray:** While the sow is not humble, the core of the story is about the value of the ""product,"" not the personality trait of arrogance.
*   **D) It is good to set aside our proud disputes...:** This refers to conflict resolution, which is not the primary focus here.
*   **E) Nurturing is key:** While ""well bred"" can imply nurturing, the fable is traditionally used to contrast numerical superiority with intrinsic excellence.

Therefore, the story teaches that one high-quality item is superior to many low-quality items.

1.  **The Physical Description:** The figure (representing Opportunity or the Greek god *Kairos*) is ""bald but with a lock of hair on his forehead."" This implies that he can be grabbed only from the front.
2.  **The Movement:** He is ""running swiftly"" and ""once he has moved on not even Jupiter himself can pull him back."" This emphasizes that opportunity is fleeting and temporary.
3.  **The Conclusion:** The text explicitly states this is a ""symbol of Opportunity, the brief moment in which things are possible.""

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
*   **A) Seize opportunities when they arise:** The imagery of the lock of hair on the forehead (the ""forelock"") signifies that you must catch opportunity as it approaches. Once it passes, its bald back makes it impossible to grasp. This aligns perfectly with the text's warning that even the king of the gods cannot retrieve a missed opportunity.
*   **B) Be content with your lot:** The text focuses on action and timing, not contentment or status.
*   **C) Power without purpose is ineffectual:** While Jupiter is mentioned, the story is about the nature of time and timing, not the misuse of power.
*   **D) Boast of one powerful thing...:** This is the moral of a different fable (often associated with the Fox and the Cat or similar tales) and does not relate to the fleeting nature of opportunity.
*   **E) Every daring act teeters on the fine line...:** While the figure balances on a ""razor's edge,"" the primary focus of the allegory is the inability to catch the figure once it has passed, emphasizing timing over vulnerability.

The central lesson is that because opportunity is fleeting and impossible to reclaim once it has passed, one must act decisively and immediately.

He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Fox's Behavior:** The fox recognizes a danger (the trap) and pauses to ponder it. When the wolf appears, the fox uses flattery and the guise of friendship (""one of my very dearest friends"") to encourage the wolf to step into the danger she has already identified. Her ""gift"" is actually a trap intended to test the mechanism or simply clear the way for herself at someone else's expense.
2.  **The Wolf's Mistake:** The wolf falls for the fox's deceptive kindness and flattery, leading to his injury.
3.  **The Concluding Dialogue:** The wolf explicitly points out that the ""gift"" was a betrayal of friendship, highlighting the theme of deception.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Flatterers and deceivers are not to be trusted:** This fits perfectly. The fox used the language of friendship and generosity to mask a trap.
*   **B) Know yourself and your limits:** This is more applicable to fables where characters try to do things physically beyond their reach (like the Frog and the Ox).
*   **C) Trust can be a double-edged sword:** While true, it is less specific to the fox's active intent to deceive.
*   **D) A single reliable skill is worth more than a bag of cunning, deceptive tricks:** This is the traditional moral of ""The Cat and the Fox,"" but in this specific story, the fox's cunning actually worked for her (she stayed safe), while the wolf's lack of caution was the problem.
*   **E) Caution is wise, but collaboration can reveal new paths:** The story shows a failure of collaboration due to betrayal.

The core lesson is that one should be wary of those who offer seemingly generous gifts or use excessive flattery, as they may be leading you into a trap for their own benefit.

1.  **The Promise:** One beetle promises to bring back food to the other if he finds a good feeding ground on the mainland. This promise is made when times are about to get tough (approaching winter).
2.  **The Reality:** The beetle finds an abundance of fresh, moist food. He eats his fill and becomes ""plump and fat.""
3.  **The Failure:** Despite his success, he returns empty-handed. When confronted, he blames the ""nature"" of the place rather than his own lack of effort or the feasibility of his original promise.
4.  **The Lesson:** The beetle on the mainland enjoyed the benefits of his discovery but did not fulfill the commitment he made to his friend. The story warns that people often make generous promises when they are seeking a better situation, but those promises are rarely kept once the person is comfortable or when the logistics of the promise become inconvenient.

**Option A** directly addresses this behavior: ""Beware of empty promises made during good times"" (or in anticipation of them). The other options (B, C, D, E) do not fit the thematic conflict between the beetle's initial promise and his eventual excuse.

1.  **The Situation:** Two frogs are looking for a new home because their current one is dry.
2.  **The Opportunity:** They find a well, which contains the water they need.
3.  **The Conflict:** One frog wants to jump in immediately (impulse/action), while the other frog stops to consider the future consequences.
4.  **The Reasoning:** The second frog realizes that while the well solves their immediate problem, it creates a potential trap. If the well dries up, they will be stuck at the bottom with no way to climb out.
5.  **The Lesson:** The story emphasizes the importance of considering the potential risks or consequences of an action before committing to it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Look before you leap:** This is a literal and metaphorical fit for the story. The frogs are literally looking into a well before leaping, and the idiom means to consider the consequences before acting.
*   **B) Watch the actions of your enemy:** There are no enemies in this story.
*   **C) Haste often leads to regret:** While related, the focus of the fable is specifically on the foresight required to avoid a trap, making A a more precise match for this specific Aesop's fable.
*   **D) Impulsive, vicious people...:** This is the moral often associated with ""The Scorpion and the Frog,"" which is a different story.
*   **E) Adaptability is key...:** The story is less about adapting to the dry pond and more about the specific danger of the well.

1.  **The Premise:** Hercules is received into heaven due to his ""excellent qualities"" (his virtue and heroic deeds). This establishes that his status is earned through merit.
2.  **The Conflict:** Hercules greets all the gods except Plutus (Wealth). He intentionally snubs him.
3.  **The Reasoning:** When asked by Jupiter why he avoids Plutus, Hercules explains that Wealth is a ""friend to the wicked"" and ""corrupts the entire world."" 
4.  **The Lesson:** The story contrasts ""excellent qualities"" (virtue) with ""riches"" (corruption). Hercules, representing the pinnacle of virtue, treats wealth with disdain because it often rewards those who lack merit and undermines moral integrity.

Now, let's look at the options:
*   **A) Coffers of cash put a stop to honest traffic in praise:** This captures the essence that wealth corrupts the ""honest"" exchange of merit and recognition.
*   **B) Easy life and seeming good fortune of others conceal a threat to their welfare:** Not relevant to Hercules' disdain.
*   **C) Wealth cannot buy true excellence:** While true to the story, it doesn't fully capture Hercules' specific point about wealth being a friend to the wicked.
*   **D) Corrupting thieves may find themselves entangled in their own disdainful deceit:** Not relevant to the plot.
*   **E) Virtue paves the path to the highest rewards:** This describes how Hercules got to heaven, but the *climax* and *dialogue* of the fable focus on the rejection of Plutus.

In the classic interpretation of Aesop's fables (Phadrus or Babrius versions), this specific story is intended to show that wealth is despised by the virtuous because it encourages social and moral corruption. Option A most closely reflects the traditional moral attached to this fable (often phrased as wealth corrupting the rewards of merit).

morables_301,"A dog made false accusations against the sheep, demanding that she pay him back a loaf of bread which, he insisted, the sheep had supposedly borrowed from him. The dog summoned the wolf as his witness",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** A dog makes a false accusation against an innocent sheep.
2.  **The Deception:** A wolf provides false testimony to support the dog's lie, far exceeding the original claim.
3.  **The Injustice:** Due to the perjury, the sheep is unjustly punished and forced to pay for a debt that never existed.
4.  **The Resolution:** Shortly after the trial, the sheep discovers the wolf dead in a ditch.
5.  **The Lesson:** The sheep identifies the wolf's death as a ""reward"" from the gods for his lies.

Key themes include **false evidence**, **perjury**, and **divine retribution** (poetic justice). The story focuses on the ultimate fate of the person who provided the false testimony.

*   **Option B** is about discipline/harshness, which doesn't fit the context of lying.
*   **Option C** and **Option E** are true observations about deception, but they do not capture the ""retribution"" aspect emphasized by the wolf's death.
*   **Option D** suggests that passivity invites more insults, which isn't the focus here, as the sheep was legally forced to pay.
*   **Option A** directly mirrors the sheep's concluding statement: that those who tell wicked lies will eventually face their ""just consequences"" (or ""just desserts"").

morables_428,"A Lark, caught in a snare, pleaded earnestly with the Fowler for her life. 'What have I done that I must die?' said she; 'I have stolen neither gold nor silver, but only a grain of corn to satisfy my ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A Lark (the victim) is caught in a snare by a Fowler (the adversary). The Lark is in a position of complete powerlessness.
2.  **The Plea:** The Lark attempts to use logic and morality to save her life. She argues that her ""crime"" (eating a grain of corn) is minor compared to stealing gold or silver, implying the punishment of death is unjust.
3.  **The Reaction:** The Fowler is completely indifferent to her arguments. He does not engage with her logic or defend his actions; he simply acts as both the executioner and the beneficiary of her capture.
4.  **The Outcome:** The Lark is killed despite having a ""right"" or ""just"" argument.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) When your adversary is also your judge, don't bother arguing.** This fits perfectly. The Fowler has the power to decide the Lark's fate (the judge) while also being the one who wants to capture her (the adversary). Logic and justice are irrelevant when the person you are pleading with has a vested interest in your destruction.
*   **B) People are willing to risk their lives for the sake of some petty profit.** While the Lark risked her life for corn, the story focuses more on her plea and the Fowler's cold response than on the risk-taking behavior itself.
*   **C) Mercy is louder than silence.** This contradicts the story; the silence of the Fowler was followed by an act of cruelty, not mercy.
*   **D)** This is a complex sentence that doesn't align with the simple, brutal reality of the fable.
*   **E)** The story proves the opposite: sincerity and innocence were powerless in this situation.

The fable illustrates that reason and pleas for justice are futile against an opponent who holds all the power and intends to harm you for their own benefit.

morables_82,"Be quiet now, said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap. If you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf. Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of this fable (Aesop's ""The Nurse and the Wolf""), let’s analyze the events:

1.  **The Premise:** A Nurse makes a threat to a child (""I will throw you to the Wolf"") that she does not actually intend to honor.
2.  **The Misunderstanding:** A Wolf hears this and takes the promise literally, basing his expectations and actions (waiting patiently) on the word of someone he considers an ""enemy"" or a stranger.
3.  **The Resolution:** When the moment comes to fulfill the ""promise,"" the Nurse does the opposite—she protects the child and sets the dogs on the Wolf.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Wolf learned the hard way that he should not have believed the words of the Nurse. In fables, threats or promises made by enemies (or those with opposing interests) are generally unreliable.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Enemies' promises were made to be broken:** This fits perfectly. The Wolf relied on the Nurse’s word, but because she was essentially his adversary (protecting the ""morsel"" he wanted), her ""promise"" was meaningless.
*   **B, C, D, E:** These do not align with the core mechanics of the story (the broken verbal threat/promise).

In many classic translations of Aesop, the moral is explicitly stated as: *""Enemies' promises were made to be broken""* or *""Do not believe everything you hear.""*

Then the fly laughed at the man and said, 'You wanted to avenge the sting of a ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the dialogue and the actions:

1.  **The Conflict:** A man hurts himself while trying to hit a fly. The fly mocks him, pointing out that in his attempt to ""murder"" the fly, he only succeeded in hurting himself more (adding insult to injury).
2.  **The Man's Defense:** The man explicitly distinguishes between his self-inflicted harm and the fly's malice. He says he can forgive himself because he **did not intend** to hurt himself, whereas the fly's very nature is to harm and loathe.
3.  **The Core Message:** The man argues that the degree of physical harm is less important than the **intent** behind it. He is willing to endure personal physical pain to eliminate a malicious nuisance, and he forgives his own mistake because his heart was not set on self-harm.

Looking at the options:
- **A) Intent matters more than the outcome:** This aligns directly with the man’s defense (""I did not try to hurt myself on purpose"").
- B) Relates to sharing; irrelevant here.
- C) While the man is calm, the story’s primary focus is on the justification of the act (intent vs. accident).
- D) ""Essential"" is not quite the right fit for the narrative logic.
- E) This is a common interpretation of similar fables, but in *this specific version*, the man explicitly rejects the idea that his self-harm is a problem, prioritizing his intent to kill the fly over the accidental slap.

In Phaedrus’s version of this fable (from which this text is derived), the moral centers on the idea that ""Injustice is easily forgiven when it is unintentional, but a creature who intentionally delights in doing harm deserves any punishment.""

The Hunter agreed, but said: 'If you desire to conquer the Stag, you mus",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Motivation:** The Horse is driven by a desire for revenge against the Stag. He cannot defeat the Stag alone, so he seeks external help.
2.  **The Trade-off:** The Hunter offers help but requires the Horse to surrender his autonomy (accepting the bit, bridle, and saddle). The Horse agrees to these constraints to achieve his short-term goal.
3.  **The Consequence:** The goal (defeating the Stag) is achieved, but the Horse finds he cannot regain his freedom. The Hunter now has power over the Horse and refuses to relinquish it.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A)** Highlights that once you give someone the tools to control you for your purpose, they will continue to use those tools for their own. This is a strong fit.
*   **B)** Suggests it is better to suffer an injury (the Stag's original insult) than to give someone power over you. This is the classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable (often phrased as ""Revenge is too dearly purchased if we lock ourselves in a state of servitude"").
*   **C)** ""Cunning"" usually refers to the underdog; while the Hunter is clever, the core of the story is about the Horse's loss of liberty.
*   **D)** Focuses on the fleeting nature of vengeance, but doesn't capture the ""power dynamic"" element.
*   **E)** Mentions the cost of freedom, but ""guidance"" is a mild term for the total physical subjugation (bit and spur) depicted.

In traditional collections of Aesop's Fables (such as Townsend's or Phaedrus), the moral is specifically that seeking revenge through the power of a superior often leads to the loss of liberty. Choice B most accurately reflects the irony that the ""remedy"" (the Hunter) was worse than the ""disease"" (the Stag).

You have such ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the character interactions step by step:

1.  **The Cat's Motivation:** The cat wants the eel but doesn't want to get wet to catch one himself. He uses two tactics: first, flattery (praising the stork's beauty) to get her to open her mouth, and second, insults (calling her filthy) to provoke a response.
2.  **The Stork's Reaction:** The stork recognizes that if she speaks (whether to accept the praise or defend herself against the insults), she will drop her prize—the eel. 
3.  **The Outcome:** By remaining silent and ignoring both the flattery and the insults, the stork successfully keeps her meal and continues on her way.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core of the story is the stork's discipline. She remains steadfast in her purpose and ignores distractions (both positive and negative) designed to make her lose her prize.

Evaluating the options:
- **A) Stay focused on your goals:** This matches the stork's behavior perfectly. She did not let flattery or anger distract her from her ""goal"" (keeping her meal).
- **B) Do not fear death:** Irrelevant to the story.
- **C) Beauty mask cunning:** While the cat used flattery, the focus of the stork's success was her refusal to engage.
- **D) Don't be seduced by cunning words:** This is close, but the stork was also subjected to insults, not just ""beautiful trouble.""
- **E) Flattery masks hidden intentions:** This describes the cat's first tactic, but not the stork's successful defense against both the flattery and the subsequent insults.

The story emphasizes that the stork succeeded because she refused to be diverted from her task.

'At the moment I am thi",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the outcome:

1.  **The Situation:** The wolf has a guaranteed meal (the dog) but chooses to delay gratification based on a promise of a better meal later.
2.  **The Strategy:** The dog uses a clever excuse (""I am thin now, but I will be fat later"") to escape immediate danger.
3.  **The Result:** The dog secures his safety by moving to an inaccessible place (the roof) and essentially tells the wolf that the opportunity has passed and will not be offered again.
4.  **The Lesson:** The wolf lost his opportunity because he was greedy and believed a promise. From the perspective of the wolf (and the reader), the takeaway is that one should secure an advantage when it is first presented rather than waiting for a potentially better, but uncertain, future gain.

Analyzing the options:
*   **A) Take what you can get when you can get it:** This fits perfectly. The wolf had the dog and let him go; he should have taken the meal when he had the chance.
*   **B) Liberty:** The story isn't about the philosophy of freedom, but rather survival and trickery.
*   **C) The cunning prey on the gullible:** While true, this is a very broad observation of the characters rather than the specific didactic point of the plot.
*   **D) Cunning enemies' persuasive promises:** This describes the dog's action, but the structure of the fable (the ""lesson learned"") focuses more on the wolf's mistake of missing his chance.
*   **E) A plea for mercy:** The dog's plea wasn't for mercy based on pity, but a tactical deception.

This fable is a variation of Aesop's ""The Dog and the Wolf,"" which specifically teaches that wise people do not let go of what they have in hand for the sake of an uncertain promise.

morables_222,"A gnat happened to land on the back of a camel and lingered there on top of the baggage. When he finally decided to disembark, he said, 'I will let myself down now as fast as I can so as not to burden",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the behavior of the two characters:

1.  **The Gnat:** He believes his presence is a significant ""load"" or ""burden"" to the camel. He feels he is performing a favor or an act of mercy by leaving, assuming the camel will be relieved to be rid of his weight. This demonstrates an inflated sense of importance.
2.  **The Camel:** He is entirely indifferent to the gnat because the gnat is so small that he wasn't even aware it was there. This highlights the gap between how important the gnat thinks he is and how important he actually is to others.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the eyes of their neighbors:** This perfectly captures the gnat's self-importance compared to the camel's indifference.
*   **B) Arrogant fools have no true influence:** While true in a sense, the story focuses more on the *perception of importance* rather than the exertion of influence.
*   **C) Patience sees beyond the insignificant:** The story isn't really about the camel's ""patience""; it is about his lack of awareness due to the size difference.
*   **D) A patient, discerning person is made wise...:** This is overly complex and does not fit the simple dynamic of the interaction.
*   **E) Even the smallest presence can go unnoticed...:** While this is a literal takeaway, a ""moral"" usually addresses the character flaw or the human condition (the gnat's ego), which Option A does more effectively.

The core of this Aesop-style fable is to mock those who overestimate their own impact on others.

Why are you trying to wound me with your teeth,",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the viper and the file:

1.  **The Action:** A viper tries to bite a metal file, treating it as if it were soft prey that could be wounded or consumed.
2.  **The Result:** The file is completely unaffected because of its nature (it is harder and more durable than the viper’s teeth).
3.  **The Lesson:** The file mocks the viper for trying to ""wound"" something that is actually designed to ""gnaw through iron."" This illustrates the futility of trying to harm someone or something that is impervious to your attacks or far more powerful/durable than yourself.

Let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) It is useless attacking the insensible:** In the context of fables (specifically Aesop's), ""insensible"" often refers to objects or characters that cannot be hurt or moved by the attack of another. The viper is wasting its energy attacking an object that cannot feel pain and is harder than its fangs.
*   **B)** This relates to lending a hand/actions vs. words, which is not the theme here.
*   **C)** While the viper is curious, the core of the story is the futility of the attack, not just the curiosity.
*   **D)** This mentions forgiveness and indignation, which are not present in the file's harsh response.
*   **E)** The file does boast, but the moral is usually directed at the ""fool"" (the viper) for picking a fight it cannot win.

In traditional translations of Aesop's Fables (e.g., Townsend or Gibbs), the moral of ""The Viper and the File"" is that it is foolish to attack those who can do you more harm than you can do to them, or that it is useless to attack those who are ""insensible"" to your bite.

As they were disputing, they passed a statue carv",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the Man and the Lion:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Man and the Lion are arguing about who is superior.
2.  **The Evidence:** The Man points to a statue of a human defeating a lion as ""proof"" of human superiority. This represents a specific viewpoint or narrative.
3.  **The Counter-Argument:** The Lion points out that the statue is biased because it was created by a human. He explains that if lions were the creators of art (the storytellers), the depicted outcome would be the opposite.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates that ""truth"" or ""superiority"" often depends on who is telling the story. A single piece of evidence or a one-sided narrative does not tell the whole story; perspectives are shaped by the prejudices and interests of the narrator.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) One story is good, till another is told:** This directly addresses the concept of perspective and bias in storytelling, matching the Lion's point that the narrative would change if the narrator changed.
*   **B, C, D, and E:** While these deal with pride or bravery, they do not capture the core irony of the statue being a product of human bias, which is the crux of the Lion's retort.

The most accurate moral is that there are two sides to every story, and the narrative is often controlled by the teller.

On his way to the assembly of the birds, the peaco",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the sequence of events and the character's motivations:

1.  **The Sacrifice:** The peacock possesses beautiful feathers. When approached by the raven, the raven offers to ""squawk your praises throughout the courts"" in exchange for feathers. The peacock agrees to this deal, trading his physical protection and beauty for public flattery and status.
2.  **The Progression:** The peacock continues this trade with various other birds (the crow, the cuckoo, etc.). He prioritizes the external validation and the ""praising"" of his name over his own physical well-being.
3.  **The Consequence:** By giving away his feathers to satisfy his desire for recognition/vanity, he loses his ability to protect himself and his chicks.
4.  **The End:** Without his feathers to provide warmth or protection, the peacock dies when winter arrives.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) Vanity can lead to self-destruction:** This fits perfectly. The peacock sacrificed his survival tools (feathers) for ""praises"" (vanity/pride), which directly led to his death.
*   **B) Do not boast to have something you do not:** The peacock actually had the feathers, so this is not about lying or false boasting.
*   **C) Opportunism can overshadow courtesy:** While the other birds were opportunists, the story focuses on the peacock's choice and his subsequent demise, placing the moral weight on his actions.
*   **D) Sorrow not over what is lost:** The peacock did not choose resilience; he died because of his choices.
*   **E) True beauty shines through kindness:** The story has a tragic ending where kindness (or rather, a misplaced desire for praise disguised as generosity) leads to death, not a positive affirmation of inner beauty.

The core lesson is that seeking flattery and prioritizing one's image (vanity) over practical necessities and responsibilities leads to ruin.

1.  **The Conflict:** A small Gnat challenges a powerful Lion. The Gnat uses its small size and agility to sting the Lion where he is vulnerable (the nose), causing the Lion to injure himself in frustration.
2.  **The Triumph:** The Gnat defeats a much larger, ""superior"" foe through cleverness and speed. 
3.  **The Hubris:** Following the victory, the Gnat becomes boastful (""buzzing about in a song of triumph"") and loses its focus.
4.  **The Downfall:** Because the Gnat is caught up in its own glory and fails to remain cautious, it flies blindly into a cobweb and is eaten by a tiny spider.
5.  **The Lesson:** The Gnat’s lamentation captures the irony: he could defeat the ""hugest beasts"" but was undone by the ""most inconsiderable of insects.""

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A)** This aligns with the ending. The Gnat’s bragging and lack of caution lead to its sudden undoing by a minor threat.
*   **B)** This is a moral more suited to ""The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing"" or similar tales; there is no ""supplicating"" enemy here.
*   **C)** While pride is involved, it turns into *death*, not just ""frustration.""
*   **D)** This is more about the Gnat's strategy against the Lion, but it doesn't account for the tragic ending with the spider.
*   **E)** This is a secondary observation, but the story's structure focuses on the reversal of fortune.

The classic moral of ""The Gnat and the Lion"" is that success can lead to a dangerous lack of vigilance, and no matter how great your victory, you are still vulnerable to the smallest dangers if you are blinded by pride. Option A best encapsulates this cycle of bragging followed by an unexpected downfall.

1.  **The Situation:** The fishermen represent professionals using their ""skill"" and effort to achieve a goal (catching fish).
2.  **The Conflict:** Despite their hard work and struggle, they fail. They are ""downcast,"" suggesting that their skill alone was not enough to produce results.
3.  **The Resolution:** A tuna fish literally jumps into their boat by accident while fleeing a predator. This is a purely random, lucky event that has nothing to do with the fishermen's fishing techniques or labor.
4.  **The Outcome:** They achieve their goal (getting a fish) through a stroke of fortune rather than their own merit.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The fishermen's skill failed them, but luck (the leaping tuna) provided the result they wanted.
*   **B:** This relates to the size of the fish, but the story isn't about the dangers of being a ""big"" fish; it's about the fishermen's success.
*   **C:** This describes the mood shift, but isn't the underlying lesson of the events.
*   **D:** This is a nonsensical phrase in the context of the story.
*   **E:** This is actually the opposite of what happened; they were giving up (""prepared to turn back"") when the fish arrived, so it wasn't their perseverance that was rewarded.

4.  **The Observation:** The man concludes that the ""deity"" was ""graceless"" (unresponsive to kindness/prayer) and only yielded to force and violence.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) People adjust their beliefs based on what is profitable for them:** This fits the man’s shift from worship to destruction once he realizes violence yielded the result that prayer did not. Historically, in the context of Aesop's fables (where this story originates), this specific fable (Perry Index 285) is often used to illustrate that some characters or ""gods"" do not reward service but must be treated harshly to get results, and that people's treatment of their ""gods"" or principles changes based on utility.
*   **B), C), and D):** These options use words from the text (like ""graceless"" or ""impatient"") but distort the meaning or focus on irrelevant details. The man's impatience actually led to a *positive* outcome for him, contradicting C.
*   **E) Fortune favors the bold who challenge fate:** While somewhat applicable, it doesn't capture the specific cynical commentary on the nature of the ""deity"" and the man's changing attitude toward it.

In many classical translations of Aesop, the moral provided is: ""The more you worship a bad man, the more he treats you with contempt; but if you treat him with contempt, he will show you respect."" This aligns with the idea that people change their approach (their ""beliefs"" or ""worship"") based on what actually produces a profit/result.

Then the little gnat said to the bull, 'It's enough for me that you have accepted my ch",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Interaction:** A tiny gnat challenges a massive bull to a contest of strength. Despite the obvious physical mismatch, the bull accepts the challenge.
2.  **The Gnat's Victory:** The gnat does not actually fight; instead, he claims victory simply because the bull acknowledged him as a worthy adversary by accepting the challenge. By engaging, the bull elevated the gnat to his level.
3.  **The Consequence:** The gnat gains fame and boasting rights, while the bull is left frustrated.
4.  **The Author's Commentary:** The text explicitly states that if the bull had been ""mindful of his own mighty bulk,"" he would have ""dismissed this opponent as beneath contempt."" By not doing so, he allowed the ""impertinent creature"" to brag.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A:** This matches the story perfectly. The bull (the superior/reputable party) entered a contest with an unworthy opponent (the gnat), which resulted in the bull losing dignity and the gnat gaining unearned status.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; the story is not about child-rearing or education.
*   **C:** While pride is involved (the gnat's pride), the core lesson is about the bull's mistake in legitimizing an inferior opponent.
*   **D:** Nonsensical in the context of this story.
*   **E:** Close, but doesn't capture the specific nuance that the *act of competing* is what creates the loss of reputation for the superior party.

The moral is that responding to or engaging with those far beneath your status or merit only serves to validate them and diminish your own standing.

The owner began to question the dog, asking how he could be so ungra",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the conflict:

1.  **The Context:** A dog ran away from a master who claims to have never personally harmed him.
2.  **The Master's Argument:** He asserts he is ""kind"" because he never personally hit the dog or spoke harsh words.
3.  **The Dog's Rebuttal:** The dog points out that while the master didn't use ""his own hands,"" he ordered others to beat the dog.
4.  **The Lesson:** The dog considers the master responsible for the actions carried out on the master's behalf. The core of the fable is about accountability and the idea that delegating a cruel task does not absolve the person who ordered it.

Looking at the options:
*   **A)** ""What a person does through another is truly their own action"" directly addresses the dog's point that being beaten ""by your order"" is the same as being beaten by the master himself.
*   **B)** Focuses on ""wicked words,"" but the master's words were actually deceptive and ""kind"" on the surface.
*   **C)** Is the master's perspective, which the fable ultimately refutes.
*   **D)** Deals with ""trusting promises,"" which isn't the primary focus of the dog's grievance.
*   **E)** Is a plot point (the markings), not the moral lesson.

The fable teaches that a leader or master is responsible for the treatment of those under them, even if they delegate the dirty work to others.

Even when they saw one of",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the characters' realizations:

1.  **Isolation and Indifference:** The sheep observe a threat (the butcher) entering their flock. Instead of acting or uniting, they ignore the danger because it isn't targeting them personally in that specific moment (""He keeps his hands off me... let him take whom he takes"").
2.  **The Consequence of Inaction:** One by one, the sheep are removed and slaughtered. Because they did not stand together to protect the first victims, their numbers dwindle until only one remains.
3.  **The Final Realization:** The last sheep realizes that their survival depended on collective action at the very beginning. By failing to protect the others, he ensured his own eventual demise.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) If you don't speak out for others, there will be nobody left to speak out for you.** This matches the theme of ""First they came..."" where a lack of solidarity in the face of a common threat leads to the destruction of the whole group, one by one.
*   **B) Do not be in a hurry to change one evil for another.** This is the moral of a different fable (The Frogs Desiring a King).
*   **C) Facing the truth is the path to wisdom.** While the sheep eventually faces the truth, the core lesson is about the failure of collective defense, not just abstract wisdom.
*   **D) An insightful speaker can turn insults into compliments.** This is unrelated to the text.
*   **E) Fitting in with the mighty doesn't always shield the vulnerable.** The sheep weren't trying to fit in with the ""mighty"" (the butcher); they were simply ignoring his actions.

The fable illustrates that by failing to defend others, the sheep guaranteed their own destruction. This aligns perfectly with Option A.

1.  **The Action:** A hooligan commits a reckless act (striking Aesop with a stone).
2.  **The ""Reward"":** Instead of punishing the boy immediately, Aesop rewards him with a coin. This positive reinforcement makes the boy believe that his bad behavior is a path to success and profit.
3.  **The Temptation:** Aesop uses the boy's greed and newfound confidence to lead him to a much more dangerous target (a wealthy, powerful man).
4.  **The Consequence:** Because the boy was emboldened by his initial ""success,"" he repeats the action against someone who has the power to punish him severely. His previous ""success"" led him directly to his execution.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) Success leads many astray to their ruin:** This fits perfectly. The hooligan’s initial ""success"" (getting a coin from Aesop) gave him a false sense of security and encouraged him to be even more reckless, which ultimately led to his death.
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for:** The hooligan didn't ""wish"" for something that turned out badly; he was manipulated through greed.
*   **C) Clever minds outwit reckless wealth:** Aesop is clever, but the target wasn't ""reckless wealth""—the hooligan was reckless.
*   **D) Avoid reckless overindulgence in manipulative pursuits:** This is too wordy and doesn't quite capture the cause-and-effect of the boy's downfall. 
*   **E) Responding with grace can disarm hostility:** Aesop didn't respond with grace to ""disarm"" hostility; he responded with trickery to ensure the hooligan faced a harsher punishment later.

In many classical translations of this Phaedrus fable (fable 3.5), the stated moral is ""Success has many led to their ruin.""

morables_584,"Winter made fun of Spring and mocked her for the fact that as soon as spring appears, nobody can keep still: some people go off to the meadows or into the woods, others like to gather flowers and lili",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue between the two personified seasons:

1.  **Winter’s Perspective:** Winter prides itself on its power and control. It characterizes itself as a ""dictator or a despot"" that forces people to ""tremble"" and stay indoors. Winter equates authority with the ability to instill fear and restrict freedom.
2.  **Spring’s Perspective:** Spring highlights its popularity and the joy it brings to people. It notes that while people want to ""get rid"" of Winter, the mere mention of Spring’s name brings pleasure. Spring is associated with freedom, beauty, and being missed when gone.
3.  **The Contrast:** The core of the argument is between two styles of influence: one that dominates through fear and hardship (Winter) and one that leads through happiness and affection (Spring). The fable concludes that the legacy and presence of the ""beloved"" (Spring) are far more desirable and respected than those of the ""feared"" (Winter).

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) It is better to be loved than feared:** This directly maps to the argument. Winter values the ""respect"" gained through fear/despotism, but Spring points out that being loved creates a lasting, positive legacy and true appreciation.
*   **B) Blame:** The story isn't about shifting blame.
*   **C) Power can be both...:** While true, the story specifically argues that one form of power is superior to the other.
*   **D) Talent in unappreciative hands:** This does not fit the context of the seasons' inherent natures.
*   **E) Harshest seasons have beauty:** The fable actually undermines this by having Spring point out that people specifically want to get rid of Winter because it lacks the ""pleasantness"" of Spring.

The fable teaches that influence gained through harshness is unwelcome, while influence gained through kindness and beauty is celebrated.

Everyone wondered at this, since the new horse was neithe",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Premise:** A soldier owns an ""excellent"" (high quality/useful) horse. He then acquires a second horse that is ""not nearly as good"" (inferior in quality and utility).
2.  **The Conflict:** Despite the first horse being objectively superior in beauty and usefulness, the soldier showers more attention and care on the new, inferior horse.
3.  **The Observation:** Observers are confused because the soldier’s actions (giving more care to the lesser horse) contradict logic and merit.
4.  **The Conclusion/Explanation:** The quote at the end suggests that this behavior is driven by the fact that the horse is the ""newest arrival."" This points to a human tendency to favor novelty or the ""new"" over proven worth and excellence.
5.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   (A) ""Everything pleases at first..."" focuses on the fading of pleasure, which is not the main point here.
    *   (B) This relates to contentment and disaster, which are not present in the text.
    *   (C) ""Beauty fades..."" is not applicable as the first horse is still beautiful.
    *   (D) This mentions ""wicked men,"" which is not a theme in the story.
    *   (E) **""We value what is less worthy more than what truly deserves our care.""** This directly reflects the soldier’s behavior: he neglects the ""excellent"" horse (truly deserving) in favor of the ""not nearly as good"" horse (less worthy) simply because it is new.

This fable (attributed to Aesop or Phaedrus) serves as a critique of how people often neglect established value for the sake of novelty.

A Kite saw him and exclaimed: 'You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no bus",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of this fable, let's analyze the story step by step:

1.  **The Event:** A seagull attempts to eat a fish that is too large for it, leading to a fatal injury. This highlights an act of overreaching or acting outside of one's natural capacity/domain.
2.  **The Commentary:** A Kite (another bird) observes the dying seagull and scolds it. The Kite’s specific criticism is that a ""bird of the air"" (the seagull) had ""no business"" seeking food from a different domain (the sea).
3.  **The Core Lesson:** The story focuses on the consequences of stepping outside of one's proper sphere or nature. The Kite points out that the seagull's downfall came from interfering with a realm it did not belong to. 

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Every man should be content to mind his own business:** This aligns perfectly with the Kite's commentary that the bird should have stuck to its own domain. In the context of Aesop's fables, ""minding one's business"" often refers to staying within one's natural station or sphere of life.
*   **B) Learn from past misfortunes:** The seagull dies, so it cannot learn from this misfortune.
*   **C) Greed breeds misfortune...:** While the seagull was ""greedy"" in taking too large a fish, the specific dialogue focuses on the *nature* of the food source (the sea) rather than just the quantity.
*   **D) How often do we supply our... enemies with... means of our own destruction:** This moral belongs to the fable of ""The Eagle and the Arrow.""
*   **E) Patience is key when facing a challenge:** This is not relevant to the seagull's sudden accident.

The most traditional and accurate moral for this specific fable (often titled ""The Gull and the Kite"") is that people should stick to their own lane or business.

They urged one another to approach the river, but no one dared to get too close bec",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the characters' motivations:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of foxes is thirsty, but the river is dangerous.
2.  **The Action:** One fox decides to prove she is superior to the others. She isn't motivated by a safe plan to get water, but by a desire to ""embarrass her fellow foxes"" and show off her bravery.
3.  **The Consequence:** Her bravado leads her to leap into a current she cannot control. She is swept away, facing potential death or at least total loss of control.
4.  **The Response:** When her companions call out to her, she makes up an excuse (""a message to take to Miletus"") to hide the fact that she is actually helpless and in danger.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly. The fox boasted of her bravery and mocked others, leading her to take a reckless risk that resulted in her being swept away.
*   **B:** The story is about ego and vanity (boasting), not financial greed or profit.
*   **C:** Boldness did not quench her thirst; it led to her being swept away by the river.
*   **D:** While she was a ""mocking"" neighbor, the focus of the fable is on her own downfall due to her boastful recklessness, not the specific suffering of her neighbors.
*   **E:** The story portrays the fox's ""courage"" as foolishness/bravado rather than a wise or necessary action.

The primary lesson is that those who act recklessly to show off or boast often find themselves in situations they cannot escape, and they frequently try to cover up their failure with further lies. This is a classic Aesopic theme regarding the dangers of vanity and boasting.

1.  **The Premise:** A lion attempts to be a fair king by suppressing his predatory nature, but his hunger eventually overrides his resolve.
2.  **The Trap:** He creates a ""no-win"" situation (a ""Catch-22""). He asks animals if his breath smells. If they are honest and say ""yes,"" he kills them for being insulting. If they lie and say ""no,"" he kills them for being liars.
3.  **The Flattery:** The monkey tries a third path—extreme flattery—comparing the lion's breath to the ""altar of the gods."" 
4.  **The Result:** Even though the monkey's flattery temporarily halts the lion, the lion simply finds a different excuse (pretending to be sick and needing ""light"" meat) to eat the monkey anyway.
5.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that when a person in power is determined to do harm or satisfy their greed, it does not matter what the victim says. Whether they tell the truth, tell a lie, or offer high praise, the outcome remains the same.

While ""C"" (Flattery can mask ruthless intentions) describes the lion's behavior, it doesn't capture the fate of the victims who tried various methods of speech. Option **A** most accurately reflects the futility of the animals' attempts to save themselves: no matter their response (truth, lie, or flattery), the penalty remained death.

The partridge immediately started squawking his usual song, sauntering through every room in the house un",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** A new partridge is brought into a house and immediately begins to behave loudly and confidently, treating the space as if he has always owned it.
2.  **The Conflict:** A longtime resident (the weasel) confronts the newcomer. The weasel highlights a breach in social etiquette: the newcomer is making quite a stir despite having no history or ""seniority"" in the house.
3.  **The Subtext:** The weasel, a predator, is questioning the partridge’s right to be so loud and unrestrained. In many versions of this Aesopic fable, the partridge's arrogance or lack of humility in a new environment is what draws the negative attention of the predator.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core of the weasel's argument is that even those who have been there a long time (and have ""rank"") behave with more modesty than the newcomer. The story warns against entering a new environment and immediately acting overconfident or ignoring the established social order/customs of that place.

Comparing the options:
*   **A** focuses on the newcomer's behavior relative to the established environment, which fits the weasel's critique.
*   **B** is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C** is incorrect because the partridge’s confidence actually puts him at risk rather than outsmarting anyone.
*   **D** is a strong contender, as the partridge's ""vanity"" (loud singing/sauntering) leads him into a confrontation with a predator (self-destruction). However, most traditional interpretations of this specific fable (labeled ""The Weasel and the Partridge"") focus on the social impropriety of the newcomer.
*   **E** is too abstract.

Between A and D, **D** captures the specific dynamic of ""confident vanity"" leading to a dangerous situation with a ""tricky"" predator, highlighting the folly of the bird's behavior. However, the dialogue emphasizes the ""right"" to speak based on tenure, making **A** the more classic moral regarding social conduct. In the context of Aesop's fables, this story serves as a warning that newcomers should be humble and observe how things are done before drawing attention to themselves.

Stung by the sharp pain,",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** The fox is in a moment of vulnerability (slipping) and reaches out for help/support.
2.  **The Action:** The fox grabs a bramble bush. By its very nature, a bramble bush is covered in thorns and ""grabs"" or pricks anything that touches it.
3.  **The Conflict:** The fox is injured by the bush and complains, expecting the bush to have behaved differently because the fox was in need.
4.  **The Resolution/Lesson:** The bramble bush points out the fox’s mistake: it is the nature of the bramble to catch and prick others. It was foolish of the fox to expect a different result from an entity whose character is inherently harmful.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) It is foolish to expect help from someone who is naturally unkind:** This fits the story perfectly. The fox expected ""help"" (support) from something that is naturally harmful/prickly. 
*   **B) No one should boast...:** There is no boasting in this story.
*   **C) Cruelty stings the sharpest:** While the thorns stung, the focus of the fable is on the misplaced expectation of the fox, not the intensity of the pain.
*   **D) A single sharp skill...:** This refers to a different Aesop fable (""The Fox and the Cat"").
*   **E) In seeking support, be mindful of the harm it may cause:** While close, this is a more modern interpretation of safety. The traditional moral focuses on the folly of the seeker for misjudging the nature of the source.

The core lesson is that you cannot expect a person (or thing) to act against their own nature, especially if that nature is to be harmful. Therefore, Option A is the most accurate moral.

But the fuller told him, 'How on earth would I be able to carr",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the roles of the two characters:

1.  **The Charcoal Burner:** His profession involves soot, dust, and black residue. His work inherently creates a dirty environment.
2.  **The Fuller:** His profession involves cleaning and whitening cloth. His work inherently requires a sterile, clean environment.

The Fuller realizes that if they live together, the nature of the charcoal burner's work will physically ruin the results of his own work. No matter how hard the Fuller works to make something white, the charcoal burner's presence will turn it black. 

This fable illustrates that certain characters, lifestyles, or businesses are inherently incompatible because the fundamental nature of one cancels out or destroys the other. This aligns with the classical interpretation of Aesop's fables, which often emphasizes that people of different natures or conflicting interests cannot successfully combine their affairs.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) Opposites are utterly incompatible:** This directly reflects the conflict between the ""black"" soot and the ""white"" cloth.
*   **B) Appearances can be deceiving:** This doesn't fit, as the issue is the actual physical residue, not a misunderstanding of appearance.
*   **C & D:** These options use wordplay on ""clean"" and ""caution"" but do not accurately reflect the structural logic of the story.
*   **E) Shared spaces require shared understanding:** While true in a modern sense, the story focuses on the *impossibility* of the arrangement rather than searching for a compromise or understanding.

The traditional moral is that ""Like should associate with like"" or that incompatible things should not be joined. Option A captures the essence of this incompatibility.

1.  **The Crime and the Deception:** A murderer is caught with bloody hands. To hide his guilt, he lies and claims the blood came from a mulberry tree (implying the juice of the berries stained him).
2.  **The Confrontation:** The murderer is caught and executed upon the very object he used as a scapegoat—the mulberry tree.
3.  **The Tree's Response:** The tree speaks, noting that it is happy to help punish him because he tried to ""smear"" its reputation by blaming it for his own violent crime.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

*   **C)** Curiosity is not the catalyst; the pursuit of justice is.
*   **D)** Focuses on greed and honor, which do not fit this specific plot.

morables_430,Some field-mice were playing in the woods where a lion was sleeping when one of the mice accidentally ran over the lion. The lion woke up and immediately grabbed the wretched little mouse with his paw,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events:

1.  **The setup:** A powerful creature (the lion) shows mercy and kindness to a weak, insignificant creature (the mouse), even though there was no immediate benefit to the lion for doing so.
2.  **The reversal:** The powerful creature finds himself in a situation where his strength is useless (trapped in a net/pit).
3.  **The payoff:** The small creature uses its specific abilities (gnawing) to save the powerful one, returning the favor.

- **Option A** highlights that a small act of kindness (sparing the mouse) eventually resulted in a life-saving reward. This fits the classic theme of Aesop's ""The Lion and the Mouse.""
- **Option B** is incorrect because the match resulted in mutual benefit, not misery.
- **Option C** is a secondary theme but does not capture the reciprocal relationship between the characters.
- **Option D** contradicts the story, as the mouse’s help was genuine and based on gratitude.
- **Option E** is vague; while the mouse's action was small, the story is specifically about **mercy and gratitude**.

The core lesson is that even the most powerful being may one day need help from the humblest, and therefore, an act of kindness is never a waste.

When they had admitted him into the cote, they found that he made more havoc and slew a l",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the plot and consequences:

1.  **The Situation:** The Pigeons are afraid of a Kite (a relatively small bird of prey).
2.  **The Action:** To solve this problem, they seek protection from a Hawk (a more powerful and aggressive predator).
3.  **The Outcome:** The Hawk enters the cote and kills more pigeons in one day than the Kite would have killed in a year.
4.  **The Lesson:** The ""solution"" the pigeons chose was significantly more destructive than the original threat they were trying to escape.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **B, C, and D** relate to different Aesop fables (e.g., ""The Frogs and the Fighting Bulls"" or ""The Wolf and the Lamb"").
*   **E** is a plausible interpretation of the theme of safety, but it is less precise than A regarding the comparative damage done.
*   **A (""Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease"")** is the classic moral associated with this specific fable. It perfectly encapsulates the irony that the Hawk (the remedy) caused more ""havoc"" than the Kite (the disease).

morables_394,"When Zeus had fashioned man and woman, he ordered Hermes to take them to Gaia, the Earth, and to show them how to obtain food by digging in the ground. At first, the Earth refused to cooperate in Herm",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Origin:** Zeus creates humans and intends for them to survive by farming the Earth.
2.  **The Conflict:** Gaia (the Earth) initially refuses to help, likely because she knows the toll it will take on her or the effort it will require.
3.  **The Resolution:** Hermes compels the Earth to obey, but the Earth provides a condition/prophecy: Humans can take food from her, but it will come at the price of ""groans and tears"" (hard labor and sorrow).

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Easy gains often come with hidden costs and hardships.** This fits the narrative perfectly. While humans gain the ability to feed themselves (an essential gain), it is not ""free."" The Earth explicitly states that the price for this sustenance is physical labor and suffering.
*   **B) Do not fight with those who are perfectly capable of fighting back.** While Hermes uses force, the focus of the Earth's final word is on the human condition of labor, not the conflict between deities.
*   **C) Power can sway the reluctant.** While Hermes (representing Zeus) sways the Earth, this is a plot point rather than the ""moral lesson"" intended for the reader (usually humans).
*   **D) Powerful physical stature does not guarantee wisdom.** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **E) Guidance is the seed of self-sufficiency.** While Hermes provides guidance, the story ends on a somber note about the cost of that self-sufficiency, making ""A"" a more accurate reflection of the fable's warning.

The story serves as an etiological myth explaining why agriculture is such exhausting, grueling work. It emphasizes that human survival is inextricably linked to struggle and toil.

The butcher turned around and said to him, 'You haven't stolen my heart; indeed, I have taken heart from this lesson! So if you eve",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Event:** A dog successfully steals a piece of meat (a heart) from a butcher.
2.  **The Butcher's Reaction:** Instead of simply being angry about the loss, the butcher acknowledges that he has learned something from the experience (""I have taken heart from this lesson"").
3.  **The Resolution:** The butcher declares that he will be more vigilant and prepared in the future, ensuring the dog cannot repeat the act without facing consequences.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Experience teaches valuable lessons and encourages caution:** This aligns perfectly with the butcher's statement. He used the negative experience of the theft to gain wisdom and will now be more cautious.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** While the dog acted according to its nature, the focus of the fable's resolution is on the butcher's newfound wisdom.
*   **C) Boldness without caution leads astray:** This might apply to the dog, but the story ends with the butcher's perspective on learning.
*   **D) Better to face a bold, known danger...:** This relates to other Aesop fables (like the Wolf and the Crane) but doesn't fit the context of a merchant learning from a thief.
*   **E) Desire can lead to actions that betray trust:** There was no established trust between the butcher and the stray dog.

The core of the story is the butcher's realization that he was caught off guard and his determination to let that experience inform his future behavior. This is a classic ""lesson learned"" narrative.

morables_498,"There was a bullock who had been turned loose in the fields without ever having borne the burden of the yoke. When he saw a hard-working bull who was pulling a plow, the bullock said to him, 'You poor",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the narrative arc:

1.  **The Conflict:** A young bullock mocks an older bull for his hard work and ""pitiful"" life under the yoke. The bullock is proud of his leisure and freedom from toil.
2.  **The Turning Point:** The hard-working bull is rewarded with rest (unvoked and led to pasture), while the idle bullock is chosen for sacrifice because he is ""fresh"" and unlabored. 
3.  **The Resolution:** The older bull points out that the bullock's previous ease was actually the precursor to his early death. The bullock's mockery was premature because his fate ended up being far worse than that of the hard worker.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) He laughs best that laughs last:** This is a classic idiom for stories where someone mocks another's misfortune or situation, only to have the tables turned in the end. The bullock laughed at the bull initially, but the bull eventually had the final word (the ""last laugh"") as the bullock was led to slaughter. 
*   **B) The great do not always prevail:** This does not fit, as the ""greatness"" of the characters is not the focus.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers youthful naivety:** While true in a general sense, the story focuses more on the reversal of fortunes and the dangers of idleness/mockery.
*   **D) He that is neither...:** This is nonsensical in this context. 
*   **E) One should not judge others...:** This is a secondary lesson, but the primary traditional moral of this specific Aesop’s fable (""The Bullock and the Ox"") focuses on the vanity of the bullock's ease and the reversal of their fates.

In many classical translations of this fable (often titled ""The Bullock and the Ox""), the moral is specifically summarized as: ""He who laughs last, laughs best,"" or ""Idleness leads to destruction."" Given the options, **A** most accurately captures the reversal of the bullock's mockery.

morables_174,It is common to take Maltese dogs and pet monkeys on long sea voyages in order to relieve the boredom of the passage. A man who was planning to make such a voyage had brought his monkey along with him,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Situation:** A monkey is saved from drowning by a dolphin who mistakes him for a human.
2.  **The Lie:** While being saved, the monkey attempts to impress the dolphin by pretending he is a high-born Athenian.
3.  **The Exposure:** When the dolphin asks if the monkey knows Piraeus (the harbor), the monkey, trying to maintain his facade, pretends Piraeus is a person he knows personally.
4.  **The Consequence:** The dolphin realizes the monkey is a liar. Because the monkey tried to pretend he was something he wasn't (a knowledgeable, high-status human), the dolphin becomes angry and lets him drown (or actively kills him).

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A)** This directly addresses the monkey's behavior. He pretended to be a prestigious human and ended up literally and figuratively ""in deep water"" (a pun on his death and his trouble).
*   **B)** This is unrelated to the theme of the story.
*   **C)** The story is about the failure of lies, not the calming effect of plans.
*   **D)** This is grammatically confused and doesn't accurately reflect the causality of the story.
*   **E)** The companionship actually led to the monkey's death because of his boastfulness; it was not a source of strength.

The story serves as a warning against being a ""pretender"" or a ""boaster."" By lying to make himself seem more important, the monkey lost the protection of his savior. This leads directly to the conclusion that those who pretend to be what they are not will eventually face disaster.

morables_25,"A Certain House was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this, made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Threat:** The Cat enters the house and begins eating the mice, establishing herself as a known predator.
2.  **The Response:** The mice adapt by staying in their holes to ensure their safety.
3.  **The Deception:** The Cat attempts to deceive the mice by playing dead, hoping they will let their guard down.
4.  **The Result:** The mice, having already experienced the Cat’s true nature, are not fooled. They recognize that even if she changed her outward appearance (like a meal-bag), her character remains dangerous.

**Step-by-step evaluation of the options:**
- **A) He who is once deceived is doubly cautious:** This fits perfectly. The mice have already been hunted (""deceived"" in the sense of being caught off guard initially) and have learned their lesson. They are now so cautious that no trick, no matter how clever, will lure them out.
- **B) Beware of when the powerful and the deceitful collaborate:** There is only one antagonist (the Cat) acting alone, so there is no collaboration.
- **C) Caution tempers cunning:** While the mice are cautious and the cat is cunning, the focus of the fable is on the mice's refusal to be tricked again based on past experience.
- **D) Relying too much on cunning subordinates...:** There are no subordinates in this story.
- **E) Unchecked problems invite opportunistic solutions:** This describes the Cat's entry, but not the resolution or the primary lesson of the interaction between the predator and prey.

The core lesson is that once someone has shown themselves to be a threat, a wise person (or mouse) remains wary of them, regardless of what new ""disguise"" or trick they employ. This is a classic Aesop moral.

Just as he was about to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and wak",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the text step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A traveler chooses to sleep on the edge of a deep well, a location that is objectively dangerous.
2.  **The Conflict:** He is about to fall in due to his own lack of caution.
3.  **The Resolution:** ""Dame Fortune"" (personified luck/fate) wakes him up.
4.  **The Message:** Dame Fortune explicitly states that if he had fallen, people would have blamed ""bad luck"" or ""fate"" for the accident, even though it was actually the traveler's own ""folly"" (carelessness) that put him in danger.
5.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches that humans often blame fate for their misfortunes when, in reality, their own choices and actions are responsible. Therefore, we are the masters of our own outcomes.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Everyone is more or less master of his own fate:** This aligns perfectly with Dame Fortune's speech about men bringing calamities on themselves through folly rather than by her hand.
*   **B) Every tale is not to be believed:** Irrelevant to the traveler's actions.
*   **C) Guard your energy wisely:** While he was tired, the danger came from *where* he slept, not the fact that he was tired.
*   **D) He who incites to concerned strife...:** This is a moral for a completely different kind of story (usually involving instigators).
*   **E) Exhaustion can lead to perilous oversight:** While true in a literal sense, the fable focuses on the *blame* attributed to fate versus personal responsibility.

The most accurate moral based on the dialogue of Dame Fortune is that individuals are responsible for their own destinies.

The man took the handle and fitted it to his axe. The",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Request:** A man creates an axe head but lacks the means to use it effectively. He asks his potential victims (the trees) for a handle.
2.  **The Cooperation:** The trees, perhaps thinking they are being helpful or prioritizing the request of the ""hardest wood,"" provide him with a handle from the wild olive.
3.  **The Betrayal:** Once equipped with the handle, the man immediately uses the completed tool to destroy the very trees that assisted him.
4.  **The Realization:** The oak tree realizes that their own contribution—providing the handle—enabled the man to harm them.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A)** This is a strong candidate as it highlights the danger of assisting someone who intends to harm you.
*   **B)** This is a variation of a moral from a different Aesop fable (*The Stag and the Horse*), focusing on freedom versus safety.
*   **C)** This captures the essence of the ""Trees and the Axe."" By giving away the ""handle"" (the tool for their own destruction) without considering the consequences, the trees invited their own ruin.
*   **D)** This is overly philosophical and doesn't fit the trees' voluntary choice to help.
*   **E)** This is irrelevant to the plot.

Historically, this specific fable (Aesop's *The Woodcutter and the Trees*) is most frequently associated with the lesson that one should not provide the means for their own destruction. While ""A"" is close, the standard moral found in classic translations (and the one that best fits the irony of the trees providing the ""handle"") is that in being over-generous or helpful to a foe without foresight, one provides the instrument of their own downfall. 

Note on the choices provided: many versions of this fable use a moral similar to **A**, but the specific phrasing ""You should think twice before offering anything to your enemies"" directly addresses the tactical error made by the trees.

The crab said to her, 'O mother, lead the way, and I will try to walk accordingly.",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Precept:** The mother crab gives her son a verbal instruction (a ""precept"") to do something that is contrary to his (and her) nature—walking in a straight line.
2.  **The Challenge:** The son asks the mother to demonstrate the behavior. He is willing to follow her example rather than just her words.
3.  **The Failure:** The mother is unable to perform the task she demanded of her son because she is limited by the same nature.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The mother's advice is rendered useless because she cannot back it up with her own actions.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) Example is more powerful than precept:** This fits perfectly. A ""precept"" is a rule or instruction. The story illustrates that teaching by doing (example) is effective, while teaching only by words (precept) is ineffective—especially if the teacher cannot follow their own rules.
*   **B) Contentment...:** The story is about behavior and instruction, not contentment or happiness.
*   **C) Those who cannot see the path...:** While the mother is guiding her son ""astray"" (by asking for the impossible), the core of the story is about the hypocrisy of the teacher.
*   **D) Hypocritical equals...:** While there is hypocrisy, the focus is on the relationship between instruction and action.
*   **E) Even the crooked can find their way...:** This is factually incorrect based on the story, as neither can walk straight.

The most traditional and accurate moral for this Aesop's fable is that one should not criticize others for things they cannot do themselves, or more concisely, that setting an example is the only way to lead effectively.

When the fox found out about this she paid a visit to the wolf a,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the character traits displayed:

1.  **The Characters:** Both the wolf and the fox are established as ""thieves"" or predators. The wolf has a hoard of stolen ""booty,"" and the fox is characterized by her deceitful attempt to get some of it.
2.  **The Conflict:** The wolf is rude and suspicious; the fox is vengeful. The fox betrays the wolf to the shepherd, leading to the wolf's death.
3.  **The Outcome:** The fox enjoys the wolf's stolen goods, but shortly after, she is caught by hunters.
4.  **The Resolution:** In her final moments, the fox acknowledges that her death is a result of the ""serious crime"" she committed by bringing about someone else's death (betrayal). 

Looking at the options:
- **A) Take pleasure when thieves destroy themselves:** This aligns with the classic interpretation of this Aesopic fable (often titled ""The Wolf and the Fox""). The story demonstrates a ""no honor among thieves"" scenario where two dishonest beings cause each other's downfall. The reader/observer is meant to find satisfaction in the fact that two predators are removed from the world by their own treachery.
- **B, C, D, E:** These either focus on only one part of the story (the wolf's rudeness or the fox's cunning) or contradict the story's grim ending (there is no gratitude or ""unexpected companionship"").

The core lesson is that the wicked often bring about their own destruction through their mutual malice, and the world is better for it.

But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; ,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **Initial Conflict:** An Eagle and a Serpent are locked in a life-and-death struggle.
2.  **Act of Kindness:** A countryman intervenes to help the Eagle, saving its life and allowing it to escape.
3.  **The Threat:** In retaliation, the Serpent poisons the man's water supply (his drinking-horn). 
4.  **The Reciprocation:** Just as the man is about to drink the poison, the Eagle intervenes and knocks the horn away, saving the man's life in return for the man's earlier help.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) One good turn deserves another:** This fits the narrative perfectly. The man did a ""good turn"" for the Eagle, and the Eagle returned the favor by saving the man's life.
*   **B) Do not try to grasp too much at once:** This is the moral of the fable ""The Boy and the Filberts,"" and does not apply here.
*   **C) Quick actions can be vengeful:** While the serpent's action was vengeful, the overarching lesson focuses on the relationship between the man and the eagle.
*   **D) Destroy the swift seed of vengeful evil...:** While this sounds like a proverb, it does not capture the reciprocal nature of the story's climax. 
*   **E) Even the mighty must be wary...:** While true for the Eagle initially, the resolution of the story is about the repayment of a debt of gratitude.

The story is a classic illustration of gratitude and the idea that kindness is rewarded with kindness.

His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, My master gives a feast, a",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** A dog invites a stranger dog to a feast hosted by his master. The guest dog has no legal or social standing to be there; he is essentially an uninvited interloper entering a private space through a personal connection rather than an official invitation.
2.  **The Expectation:** The guest dog is greedy and presumptive, planning to gorge himself on food that was not intended for him.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he did not have the right to be there, the Cook (the authority figure of the kitchen) treats him like an intruder and violently ejects him through a window.
4.  **The Aftermath:** The dog lies to his peers to hide his shame, but the physical reality remains: he was thrown out because he entered through an illegitimate ""back door"" route.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. ""Entering by the back stairs"" is a metaphor for entering a place through unofficial, unauthorized, or ""sneaky"" means. Being ""shown out at the window"" is the undignified and forceful removal that follows such an intrusion.
*   **B:** There were no ""enemies"" making promises in this story; it was a friend’s invitation.
*   **C:** While the dog felt hope, the story is a cautionary tale about the consequences of that hope being misplaced/unauthorized. 
*   **D:** There was no specific ""deceitful promise of safety"" from a danger; it was an invitation to a feast.
*   **E:** This is the opposite of the lesson; the generosity of the master did *not* extend to the dog, which is why he was thrown out.

The traditional moral of this Aesop fable (often titled ""The Dog and the Cook"") emphasizes that those who sneak into places where they don't belong should not be surprised when they are treated harshly.

He ordered that the bag of coins be brought to him as he was dying and then asked",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the narrative elements:

1.  **The Character:** A ""miserly man"" who has acquired wealth through ""ill-gotten"" means.
2.  **The Conflict:** He is dying and realizes he cannot take his wealth with him. He asks the money who will benefit from it.
3.  **The Outcome (The Lesson):** The money informs him that his labor was in vain. Not only will his heirs waste the money on vice (meaning he failed to leave a meaningful legacy), but the ""ill-gotten"" nature of the wealth has secured his soul's ""eternal torment.""

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) A life of greed and hoarding wealth leads to misery:** While partially true, the story focuses specifically on the *source* of the wealth (""ill-gotten"") and the specific spiritual consequence mentioned at the end.
*   **B)** Irrelevant to this fable.
*   **C) Ill-gotten gains bring eternal torment:** This directly reflects the climax of the story. The bag explicitly states the demons will torment his soul because of the nature of his accumulation. It captures both the ""ill-gotten"" aspect and the ""torment"" mentioned in the text.
*   **D)** Irrelevant; this describes a lesson about fear of the unknown.
*   **E) The fruits of toil may not always yield the intended legacy:** This is a secondary theme (the heirs squandering the money), but it misses the primary spiritual warning regarding the ""ill-gotten"" nature of the coins.

In fables of this nature (often attributed to collections like Aesop's or medieval exempla), the emphasis is usually on the spiritual peril of dishonest gain.

The city mouse finished his business in the country and by means of insistent inv,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Setup:** The story contrasts two lifestyles: the country mouse's ""humble meal of acorns"" and the city mouse's ""various delicacies.""
2.  **The Conflict:** While the city mouse has abundance, it comes with extreme danger and fear. The country mouse is ""frightened out of his wits"" because he does not know where to hide when the butler enters.
3.  **The Resolution:** The city mouse argues that the quality of the food (wealth/luxury) is the most important thing. However, the country mouse concludes that the ""security"" and ""freedom"" of his humble life are far more valuable than the ""delicacies"" that come with constant terror.
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A:** Directly aligns with the country mouse’s conclusion. It suggests that a simple, poor life (self-sufficient poverty) is preferable to a wealthy life filled with anxiety and danger (tormented by worries of wealth).
    *   **B:** While generally true, it is too broad and doesn't capture the specific contrast between luxury and security.
    *   **C:** This describes a plot point (the city mouse knowing the hole) but isn't the ""moral"" or lesson of the story.
    *   **D:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
    *   **E:** This describes the plot of the story rather than the ethical lesson derived from it.

The central theme of Aesop's ""The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse"" is that a life of peace and safety is better than a life of luxury accompanied by fear.

The beetle then felt contem",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative arc:

1.  **The Character's State:** The beetle is initially ""fully sated"" and comfortable in his home (the dung heap).
2.  **The Conflict (Hubris/Arrogance):** Upon seeing the eagle, he becomes dissatisfied and arrogant. He claims his voice is as pleasant as the eagle's and his sheen is just as good. He looks down on his fellow beetles and his way of life.
3.  **The Action:** He attempts to leave his nature behind to ""consort with the birds,"" overestimating his physical capabilities (strength, endurance against wind).
4.  **The Resolution:** He fails miserably, ends up ""shaken and exhausted"" far from home, and faces starvation. He realizes his mistake and wishes only to return to his former, humble life.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Disaster awaits the arrogant person who puts on airs...** This fits perfectly. The beetle put on airs by comparing himself to an eagle and left his stable life for an impossible goal, nearly losing everything in the process.
*   **B) The weak may find a way to avenge a wrong.** This is the moral of a different Aesop fable involving an eagle and a beetle (where the beetle seeks revenge for the eagle eating a hare), but it does not fit this specific story.
*   **C) Embrace diversity...** The story actually warns against trying to be something you are not.
*   **D) If ambitious words suffice not...** This suggests physical violence or further action, which doesn't reflect the outcome of this fable.
*   **E) Even the humblest beginnings...** The story portrays the ""lofty wonder"" as a mistake fueled by arrogance, not an inspirational spark.

Choice A captures the essence of the ""fall from grace"" caused by hubris and the loss of one's original stability.

I can't decide what to do: my love of money and my innat",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the character's conflict and actions:

1.  **The Conflict:** The protagonist encounters a ""lion of gold."" This represents a massive opportunity and sudden wealth. However, his character is defined by two traits: greed (the desire for the gold) and cowardice (the irrational fear of the lion shape, even though it is made of inanimate metal).
2.  **The Struggle:** He describes himself as being ""at war with itself."" His internal dilemma—wanting the prize but being too afraid of the form it takes—prevents him from acting directly. 
3.  **The Resolution:** Instead of overcoming his fear to enjoy the gold, he chooses to remain at a distance and send others to do the work. The central irony is that he holds a treasure in his hands (proverbially), but his nature makes it impossible for him to truly possess or enjoy it. He calls it a ""treasure that offers no satisfaction.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This directly addresses the paradox of the story: the man has found wealth, but because of his cowardice (his fear of the ""lion""), the gold provides him no actual benefit or pleasure. He is a ""greedy coward"" who is paralyzed by the object of his greed.
*   **B)** This is a common moral for other Aesop fables (like ""The Cat-Maiden"") but doesn't fit the internal psychological struggle here.
*   **C)** Usually, greed blinds people to *danger*; here, the character is hyper-aware of a perceived (though imaginary) danger.
*   **D)** The character is not ""serving,"" nor is there actual ""peril"" (the lion is gold, not real).
*   **E)** While he is indecisive, the root cause is specifically the mismatch between his desire and his courage, making A a more precise fit for the fable's focus on the ""lion of gold.""

The fable illustrates that wealth is meaningless to someone whose character prevents them from seizing or enjoying it.

1.  **Analyze the Plot:** The hares (the weak) propose a system of equality and shared power among all animals so that the strong (the lions) cannot prey upon the weak.
2.  **Analyze the Conflict:** The lions acknowledge that the *idea* or the *rhetoric* sounds good, but they point out a fundamental physical reality: the hares do not have the natural weapons (claws and teeth) to enforce or back up such a demand for equality.
3.  **Identify the Theme:** The fable highlights the gap between idealism (the hares' desire for equality) and the reality of power dynamics. In a world governed by ""might makes right,"" a demand for rights or equality is often ignored if the party making the demand lacks the power to enforce it or defend themselves.
4.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **B, C, D, and E** all suggest a moral or idealistic outcome (usefulness of the small, fairness as strength, the value of love over fear, or the power of dialogue). However, the story ends with the lions rejecting the hares' proposal based on a lack of physical power.
    *   **A) Be prepared to defend your position:** This aligns with the lions' retort. It suggests that arguments for one's rights or status are ineffective unless one has the ""teeth and claws"" (the means or strength) to defend that position.

The fable (attributed to Aesop or found in Aristotle's *Politics*) is a classic illustration that ""Equality of rights is of no value unless there is the power to maintain them.""

There was a whole crowd of monkeys there and one of them ,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character motivations:

1.  **The Setting:** The men are in a land ruled by an animal (a monkey) who is mimicking human structures of power (an emperor). This establishes an environment based on a false pretension or a ""deception"" of grandeur.
2.  **The Liar’s Success:** The first man recognizes the leader's vanity and lies to feed it. He calls the monkey an ""emperor"" and the others ""officials."" He is rewarded because his lies align with the monkey’s desired delusion.
3.  **The Truth-Teller’s Logic:** The second man assumes that if a lie earns a reward, the truth must earn a greater one. He fails to realize that the person in power does not value reality; they value the ego-boost provided by the lie.
4.  **The Outcome:** When the truth-teller speaks the objective truth (""You are simply a monkey""), he is brutally attacked. The monkey (the one thriving on deception) reacts with violence toward the person who exposes the reality of the situation.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The monkey ""thrives on deception"" (pretending to be an emperor) and ""retaliates"" against the one who speaks the truth because the truth threatens the monkey's pride.
*   **B:** Inconsequential to the plot; we know exactly who the characters are.
*   **C:** While the monkey is deceived by flattery, the focus of the ending is the punishment of the truth-teller, not the folly of the monkey.
*   **D:** This is irrelevant to the plot’s outcome.
*   **E:** The story proves the opposite—truth was not a defense; it was the cause of the man’s injury.

The fable teaches that in a ""land"" or situation built on lies and vanity, telling the truth is dangerous because those in power would rather be flattered than accurately described.

This slave-woman, bedecked with gold and trailing a delicate purple robe aro",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the key elements of the fable:

1.  **The Premise:** A man is inexplicably in love with a woman described as ""ugly"" and ""wicked."" He lavishes her with gifts (gold and purple robes) despite her bad character.
2.  **The Conflict:** The slave-woman believes her good fortune (the man's affection) is a result of Aphrodite’s favor. She believes Aphrodite has made her desirable.
3.  **The Resolution:** Aphrodite personally intervenes to correct this misconception. She expresses anger rather than pride, stating she had nothing to do with it and is offended that the man finds such an ""ugly"" person attractive.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the irrationality of the man's attraction. In ancient Greek fables (like those of Aesop, from which this is derived), such inexplicable behavior is often attributed to a ""blindness"" or a lack of sanity. Aphrodite’s disgust emphasizes that there is nothing divinely beautiful or naturally good about the situation; it is a perversion of taste or a form of madness.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This aligns with the ancient context. The gods are offended by the misapplication of ""beauty"" to something ""ugly,"" suggesting the man is ""out of his mind.""
*   **B:** There is no mention of a conscience or guilt.
*   **C:** The story does not suggest the man's generosity makes her better; it makes her more arrogant.
*   **D:** The ""lot"" isn't beautiful; it's considered an affront to beauty.
*   **E:** This is a modern moral, but the fable emphasizes that she is ""wicked"" and ""ugly"" and that the goddess herself rejects her.

The classical moral focuses on the madness of the man for seeing beauty where none exists.

morables_134,A father had an unmanageable son who indulged his vicious adolescent temper by brutally whipping the slaves whenever his father wasn't looking. Aesop therefore shared this little story with the father,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the lesson provided in the fable:

1.  **The Problem:** A father has a son with a ""vicious adolescent temper"" who is causing harm to others (the slaves).
2.  **The Analogy:** A farmer yokes a ""young bull"" (representing the reckless son) to an ""old bull"" (representing the moderate, experienced father). 
3.  **The Purpose:** The farmer clarifies that the old bull is not there to pull a heavy load, but to ""keep the young bull in check"" because the young bull has ""lamed many of the other bulls.""
4.  **The Application:** Aesop explicitly tells the father to keep the boy beside him to ""restrain his reckless inclinations"" using the father’s own ""moderation.""

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) A mild disposition can put a stop to vicious behaviour:** This is the core message. The moderation (mild disposition) of the father/old bull acts as a tether or restraint to the violence of the youth.
*   **B) Do not mock the feelings of old age...:** This is irrelevant to the plot of the story.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers reckless aggression:** While similar to A, the text focuses specifically on the ""moderation"" (the temperance of behavior) rather than just intellectual wisdom. However, ""moderation"" and ""mild disposition"" are closer synonyms to the narrative's solution for ""vicious behavior"" and ""reckless inclinations.""
*   **D) Slow and steady wins the race:** This is the moral of *The Tortoise and the Hare*, not this fable.
*   **E) Unchecked behavior in youth can lead to greater harm:** This is a warning found in the story, but it describes the *consequence* rather than the *moral lesson* (how to solve the problem).

The story teaches that the steady, moderate influence of an elder can serve as a corrective restraint on the volatile temper of youth. Option A most accurately captures this dynamic of a ""mild disposition"" (moderation) stopping ""vicious behavior"" (the whipping/kicking).

All the other passengers started to swim, but the Athenian kept praying to Athena, maki",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s look at the behavior of the characters:

1.  **The Situation:** A ship has capsized, and the passengers are in life-threatening danger.
2.  **The Athenian's Action:** He relies entirely on divine intervention, praying and making promises to the goddess Athena instead of physically trying to save himself.
3.  **The Fellow Passenger's Advice:** He tells the Athenian to ""start moving your arms"" (i.e., swim) while he prays.

The story highlights the folly of relying solely on external or divine help without taking personal action. It teaches that while faith or hope might be part of one's process, it must be accompanied by individual exertion to be effective. This is often summarized by the proverb, ""God helps those who help themselves.""

*   **Option A (Self-effort is essential)** directly reflects this lesson: the Athenian must swim if he wants to survive.
*   Option B refers to wisdom/education, which isn't the focus here.
*   Option C (Practicality) is close, but A is more specific to the necessity of personal action in the face of a challenge.
*   Options D and E do not fit the narrative arc of the fable.

Therefore, the moral is that one must put in personal effort rather than expecting to be saved by others or by fate alone.

1.  **The Conflict:** The Frog and the Mouse are so focused on their petty rivalry over a small territory (the marsh) that they decide to engage in a ""fight to the death.""
2.  **The Distraction:** Their intense focus on one another and their combat blinds them to their surroundings. They are preoccupied with winning the ""sovereignty"" of the marsh.
3.  **The Outcome:** Because they are preoccupied with fighting each other, they become easy targets for a third party—the Kite. The Kite does not care about their dispute; it simply sees an opportunity to seize both of them.
4.  **The Lesson:** This fable (often attributed to Aesop) illustrates that when two parties consume themselves with infighting, they become vulnerable to a common enemy or allow a third party to benefit from their ruin.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A) When fools fight others run away with the prize:** This is a strong candidate, as the Kite ""wins"" while the combatants lose. However, the story emphasizes the loss of life and the lack of awareness more than just a stolen prize.
- **B) People who do harm to others destroy themselves in the bargain:** While they are destroyed, the focus is more on the external threat they ignored.
- **C) Stay vigilant:** A bit too broad.
- **D) Be observant before you make a predatory leap:** This applies to the Kite, but fables usually focus on the protagonists (the Frog and Mouse).
- **E) Rivalries can blind us to the greater dangers lurking nearby:** This most accurately captures the tragic irony of the story—that their obsession with their domestic rivalry prevented them from seeing the lethal threat from above.

In traditional collections of Aesop's Fables, this story (The Frog and the Mouse) is most frequently used to illustrate that **""When fools fight, others run away with the prize""** or ""In quarrels, a third party often reaps the fruits."" Between A and E, A is the classical phrasing of the moral associated with this specific fable.

The surviving daughter wondered to see strangers so much concerned at the loss of her sister, and he",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A mother has lost a daughter. She hires professional mourners (strangers) to cry at the funeral.
2.  **The Observation:** The surviving daughter notices a discrepancy: the strangers appear deeply distraught and loudly emotional, while the actual family members (the ""kin"") appear relatively calm or reserved.
3.  **The Question:** The daughter asks why the strangers seem to care more than the family.
4.  **The Mother's Explanation:** The mother reveals that the family gains nothing from performative crying (""we... are never the better for crying""), but the strangers are exhibiting grief because it is their job—they are being paid to do so (""the strangers have money for it"").

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Professional mourners serve those who pay the most:** This aligns directly with the text. The grief shown by the strangers is a transaction, not an emotion. It highlights the artificial nature of their sorrow.
*   **B) Often there is more good to be found in one man than in a crowd:** The story isn't about the ""goodness"" of individuals versus crowds, but about the motivation behind actions.
*   **C) Curiosity thrives on observation:** While the daughter is curious, this is a minor plot point, not the central lesson.
*   **D) Pragmatic temptation... compromise integrity:** This is too complex for this specific fable. The mother isn't compromising her integrity; she is following a social custom of the time (hiring mourners).
*   **E) Grief can unite strangers in shared sorrow:** The story actually suggests the opposite—that the strangers' sorrow is fake and motivated by money, not shared grief.

The core lesson revolves around the fact that outward displays of emotion can be purchased and do not necessarily reflect internal reality. In the context of classic fables (such as Aesop's, where this story originates), it serves as a commentary on hired service versus genuine feeling.

1.  **The Setting:** Truth is found in the ""wilderness"" or ""desert,"" far away from human cities.
2.  **The Conflict:** Truth has been exiled or has fled from society. 
3.  **The Reason:** Truth explains that while lies used to be rare (""found among only a few""), they have now ""spread throughout all of human society.""

*   **A) Falsehood is with all men:** This directly reflects Truth's statement that lies have spread to everyone in society, explaining why Truth can no longer reside among people.
*   **B), C), D), E):** These options introduce themes (divine sources of good, curiosity, fear of the unknown, or compassion) that are not present in the text. The text is specifically a commentary on the ubiquity of dishonesty.

As the ox stru",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Situation**: A donkey and an ox are tasked with pulling a shared load. One party (the ox) is struggling and injured, while the other (the donkey) refuses to help.
2.  **The Consequence of Neglect**: Because the donkey does not help, the ox dies from the strain.
3.  **The Shift in Burden**: Once the ox is dead, the donkey is forced to carry not only the original load but also the heavy carcass of the ox.
4.  **The Ultimate Result**: The donkey dies due to the overwhelming weight that he could have prevented by sharing the initial workload.
5.  **The Lesson**: The birds explicitly state that if the donkey had helped his companion, he would have avoided this fate.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) We must help one another, for if a neighbor falls, their burden will fall on you**: This directly mirrors the plot. The donkey’s refusal to help led to him bearing the entire burden (plus the weight of the neighbor) alone.
*   **B) Instead of looking at how things start, we should look instead at how they turn out in the end**: While true of many fables, it is too general and doesn't capture the specific theme of mutual aid.
*   **C) Hard work triumphs over cruelty**: This is incorrect, as both animals die.
*   **D) Unhelpful burdens can continue in unexpected ways**: This is close, but choice A captures the ""neighborly"" aspect and the cause-and-effect of the donkey's selfishness.
*   **E) True strength is shown through perseverance, not by avoiding effort**: This ignores the collaborative nature of the fable.

The story teaches that selfishness in a shared task is self-defeating because the failure of one's partner results in a heavier burden for oneself.

1.  **The Origin:** The story claims Man was made in a hurry, and Jupiter forgot to include ""modesty"" in his internal makeup.
2.  **The Solution:** Instead of redesigning humans individually, Jupiter released Modesty as an external force/ideal among the people.
3.  **The Conflict/Condition:** Modesty agreed to this arrangement only on the condition that she would never have to be in the company of ""carnal love."" She explicitly states, ""wherever that comes... I'm gone.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Modesty and carnal love cannot survive together:** This directly reflects the final sentence of the fable and the specific condition set by Modesty herself. The core lesson/observation of the story is the mutual exclusivity of these two forces.
*   **B) We must not require what is unreasonable:** While Jupiter’s fix was practical, the story focuses more on the nature of the virtues themselves than on the fairness of requirements.
*   **C) Haste can lead to unwelcome outcomes:** While the story mentions Man was made in a hurry, this is the premise (the ""inciting incident""), not the primary lesson or moral being illustrated by the dialogue between Modesty and Jupiter.
*   **D) Do not unmodestly mock...:** This is irrelevant to the text provided.
*   **E) Virtues shared are virtues gained:** The story describes Modesty as wary and conditional, rather than focusing on the benefits of sharing.

The narrative logic dictates that the ""moral"" is the defining characteristic of the subject (Modesty) established at the end of the tale: that modesty and lust/carnal love cannot occupy the same space.

1.  **The Action**: A monkey makes a grand, boastful claim regarding his ancestry (claiming the dead are his ancestors' freedmen).
2.  **The Context**: He chooses to make this claim while in a cemetery, where the subjects of his claim are dead.
3.  **The Observation**: The fox points out the convenience of the location. Because the people are dead, they cannot speak up to deny the monkey's claim.
4.  **The Lesson**: The fox identifies that the monkey is lying specifically because there is no one present capable of refuting him. This highlights how boasters and liars often choose circumstances where their claims cannot be verified or challenged by those involved.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** Accuracy reflects the core of the fox's observation: the monkey exploits the silence of the dead to tell a lie that can't be challenged.
*   **B)** This is the moral of a different fable (*The Dog and the Shadow* or *The Two Dogs*).
*   **C)** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific mechanical irony of the cemetery setting as well as A does.

The fable, often attributed to Aesop, is intended to show that people who boast of their pedigree or achievements usually do so when no one is around to prove them wrong.

The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural i",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events step by step:

1.  **The Act of Kindness**: The Farmer performs a selfless act of compassion by warming a frozen snake in his own bosom to save its life.
2.  **The Result**: Instead of showing gratitude, the snake follows its ""natural instincts"" (its inherent nature) and bites the man who saved it.
3.  **The Consequence**: The Farmer dies, realizing too late that his kindness could not change the nature of a ""scoundrel.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful**: This aligns perfectly with the story. No matter how much kindness the Farmer showed (saving the snake's life), it did not change the snake's harmful nature or instill a sense of loyalty/gratitude.
*   **B) The man who treats others well is rewarded by gratitude**: The story shows the exact opposite of this.
*   **C) Gratitude prevents regret**: This is a general sentiment, but the story is about the *lack* of gratitude and the presence of betrayal.
*   **D) Injuries may be regretfully forgiven, but not ungratefully forgotten**: This refers to the perspective of the victim forgiving, but the core of this fable is about the nature of the perpetrator.
*   **E) Even in the coldest times, a touch of compassion can revive what seems lost**: While literally true in the story, this is a ""surface-level"" observation rather than the moral lesson. The story serves as a warning against helping those who are inherently dangerous or ungrateful.

The classic moral of Aesop's ""The Farmer and the Viper"" is that kindness to the ill-disposed is thrown away and will not change their nature.

1.  **The Environment:** The dog is in a blacksmith shop, a place of extreme noise (heavy hammers clanging).
2.  **The Dog's Reaction to Work:** Despite the loud noise of the hammers, the dog remains asleep. This suggests that the ""work"" being done does not concern him or provide him with any immediate benefit, so he ignores it.
3.  **The Dog's Reaction to Food:** As soon as the masters start eating (a quiet activity compared to blacksmithing), the dog wakes up. This is because the food represents a direct personal benefit to him.
4.  **The Blacksmiths' Observation:** They point out the hypocrisy/selective attention of the dog: he can sleep through ""heavy hammers"" but is alerted by the ""slightest sound"" of chewing.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses this selective attention: a person (or animal) ignores what doesn't concern them but is hyper-alert to anything that benefits them.
*   **B** relates to agency and proxy actions, which is not present here.
*   **C** is a general proverb, but the story is more about selective awareness than comparing hard work to luck.
*   **D** refers to ""The Wolf and the Lamb,"" where a tyrant finds a pretext for cruelty.
*   **E** suggests a positive transformation of noise, which is not the focus.

The lesson is clearly about how self-interest dictates what we choose to notice.

He greeted the unicorn and said to him, 'Let us put aside all that we have done in the past, because I am no ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the dialogue:

1.  **The Context:** The lion and the unicorn are ""chief enemies."" This sets the stage that their relationship is fundamentally antagonistic.
2.  **The Deception:** The lion feigns illness and old age (supplicating behavior) to lower the unicorn's guard. 
3.  **The Mistake:** The unicorn pities his enemy and hands over his only means of defense (his horn), believing a promise of peace.
4.  **The Result:** Without his defense, the unicorn is immediately attacked. The lion justifies his treachery by stating that mercy toward an enemy is a weakness.
5.  **The Unicorn's Lament:** While the unicorn argues for honor (Option E), the narrative structure focuses on the *consequence* of his choice to trust a known enemy. The lion's successful attack serves as a warning against being a ""fool"" (as the lion calls him) by disarming oneself in front of a foe.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A** captures the core cautionary element of the fable: an enemy remains an enemy regardless of how humble they appear, and one must never strip away their defenses.
*   **B** is irrelevant as neither character is bragging.
*   **C** is a general truth, but not as specific to the ""enemy"" dynamic emphasized in the text.
*   **D** is a corruption of the Golden Rule and does not fit the lesson.
*   **E** represents the unicorn's perspective at the end, but the story serves more as a cautionary tale about the lion's successful treachery than a celebration of the unicorn's honor (since the unicorn ends up wounded/defeated).

The primary lesson taught by the outcome of the action is that trusting a sworn enemy—especially to the point of becoming defenseless—is a fatal mistake.

But being the ruler of the freshwater wasn't enough for him; he wanted to rule the sea too. With t",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the progression of the fable:

1.  **Preparation/Context:** The Master-Pike is already a ""Prince"" in his own domain (the river). He is described as having size, beauty, and strength.
2.  **The Conflict:** Despite having a position of power and excellence in his own sphere, he becomes overly ambitious and seeks to rule a domain (the sea) where he does not belong and where his power is insufficient compared to the native inhabitants (the Dolphin).
3.  **The Resolution:** He is humbled and forced back to his original home, realizing he was better off staying in the territory where he actually belonged.
4.  **The Lesson:** The pike learned that seeking more than what he had and venturing out of his natural place led to danger.

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Be content with your lot:** This fits perfectly. The Pike was a ruler in the river but risked everything because he wasn't content with his own ""lot"" (territory).
*   **B) Value is what others think of you...**: The story doesn't focus on the opinions of others, but rather on the Pike's own ambition.
*   **C) Strength without humility invites downfall:** While the Pike lacks humility, the core of the story is about overstepping one's bounds/territory rather than just a lack of modesty.
*   **D) Ambitious counsel without mighty help is useless:** The Pike didn't seek counsel; he acted on his own ambition.
*   **E) True leadership is not just about appearance...**: The Pike was a functional leader in the river; his failure was in expansion, not his style of leadership.

The classic moral associated with this specific Aesop-style fable is to be satisfied with your own position and territory rather than greedily reaching for things beyond your reach.

As soon as the ro,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the dialogue:

1.  **The Conflict:** Two soldiers are attacked. One flees (cowardice), while the other fights (bravery).
2.  **The Aftermath:** Once the danger is over, the coward returns, making grand threats and brandishing his weapon, pretending he is brave and ready to fight.
3.  **The Response:** The brave soldier rebukes him, noting that his boastful words are ""useless"" because his actions (running away) proved his lack of courage. He points out that while the coward's words might fool strangers, they cannot fool someone who saw him ""turn tail and run.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Courage in words means nothing if you flee in danger:** This directly addresses the contrast between the coward's post-battle boasting and his actual behavior during the crisis. It highlights the main point of the story: words are cheap if not backed by action.
*   **B) There is little risk in being poor...:** This is irrelevant to the text provided.
*   **C) Bravery outshines cowardice:** While true, this is a general observation and doesn't capture the specific irony of the coward's boastful behavior which is the focus of the fable's conclusion.
*   **D) Know your aggressive, unreliable enemies:** The coward is a companion, not an ""aggressive enemy,"" so this doesn't fit.
*   **E) Courage in adversity reveals true character:** This is a strong candidate, but option A matches the specific focus on the *deception of boastful words* versus *cowardly actions* more precisely.

The fable essentially warns against people who talk big after the danger has passed, proving that empty talk is not a substitute for actual courage.

1.  **The Premise**: All birds are invited to a prestigious event (the Eagle's wedding).
2.  **The Conflict**: The birds are upset that the Hoopoe is given a ""higher seat of honor.""
3.  **The Reasoning**: The Eagle (or the organizers) granted this honor because the Hoopoe possesses a ""crown"" and ""multicolored feathers""—purely superficial, outward traits.
4.  **The Contrast**: Despite its beautiful appearance, the Hoopoe's true nature or character involves spending ""all its time rolling around in dung and filth.""

The story highlights the irony and injustice of valuing someone based on their external beauty (the crown and feathers) while ignoring their unseemly habits or true character (living in filth). 

- **Option A** directly addresses this contrast between outward appearance and true character/deeds.
- **Option B** refers to a different fable (The Eagle and the Beetle).
- **Option C** focuses on the birds' reaction rather than the reason for the fable's structure.
- **Option D** and **E** do not fit the context of the Hoopoe's unsavory hygiene versus its ornamentation.

The lesson is that a beautiful exterior can hide a base or unrefined nature, and honor based solely on appearance is misplaced.

A swallow saw what the hen was doing and said, 'O you stupid, senseless creature! They w",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A hen (symbolizing kindness or maternal instinct) finds the eggs of a snake (symbolizing a natural predator or a ""wicked"" entity). Instead of avoiding them, she nurtures them.
2.  **The Warning:** A swallow observes this and warns the hen that she is being ""senseless.""
3.  **The Consequence:** The swallow predicts that the hatched snakes will not be grateful for the hen's care; instead, their inherent nature is to destroy. They will kill the hen (their benefactor) first, and then harm others.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates that kindness or devotion cannot change the inherent nature of something dangerous or evil. Helping a ""wicked"" entity only facilitates your own destruction.

**Analysis of choices:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The snake represents the ""wicked man"" who may seem harmless as an egg (innocuous) but remains dangerous by nature.
*   **B:** This describes greed (the moral of ""The Dog and the Shadow""), which is not present here.
*   **C:** The story teaches the exact opposite: devotion to the wrong thing creates danger.
*   **D:** This describes hubris or envy (the moral of ""The Frog and the Ox""), which is not present here.
*   **E:** While the hen tries to transcend boundaries, the story frames this as a ""senseless"" mistake rather than a virtue.

The moral is that you cannot change a villain's nature with kindness, and nurturing a threat will eventually lead to your own ruin (a theme found in many Aesop's fables, such as ""The Farmer and the Viper"").

The jackdaw, however, could not stand to live in human society, so w",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events:

1.  **The Situation:** A jackdaw is captured and kept as a pet (slave) by humans. He is unhappy because he is not in his natural environment.
2.  **The Action:** The bird seeks freedom at any cost and escapes the moment he has the chance.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he is still dragging the string from his captivity, he becomes entangled in his own home and dies.
4.  **The Realization:** The bird recognizes that his desire to escape one form of suffering (slavery/unhappiness) led him directly into a fatal situation. 

Looking at the options:
*   **A) It is not the place, nor the condition, but the mind alone that is responsible for our happiness.** This aligns with the bird's realization. He thought he could only be happy in the wild, but his impulsive drive for that ""place"" led to his death. However, in many versions of Aesop's fables, this specific story (Perry Index 131) highlights how the quest for liberty, if reckless, can lead to a worse fate or that our own nature/choices dictate our end.
*   **B, C, D:** These do not fit the plot points (there is no pity, generosity, or betrayal by trusted parties).
*   **E) Possession without freedom is a gift unappreciated.** While true for the children, the story focuses on the bird's internal realization and his ultimate fate caused by his own ""stupidity"" (as he calls it).

Option **A** is a classical philosophical takeaway for this fable (often attributed to the idea that the bird's internal state/desire for a specific ""condition"" led to his demise). It captures the theme that the bird’s perspective on his ""condition"" (viewing the home as intolerable slavery vs. the safety it provided) was the catalyst for the tragedy.

1.  **The Problem:** There is a storm at sea, and the sailors are in immediate danger.
2.  **The Action:** The sailors are praying to intermediaries (saints) to deliver their messages to a higher power.
3.  **The Critique:** One sailor points out that in an emergency, using intermediaries takes too much time and risks failure (""what if we all drown before the messenger can deliver our message?"").
4.  **The Resolution:** They stop using ""messengers"" and go ""directly to the one who can save us."" This direct approach leads to the wind calming.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) The shortest and surest way of doing things is best:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The sailor argues against the indirect route (intermediaries) in favor of the direct route (the source) because it is faster and more reliable in a crisis. 
*   **B) It is better to be loved than feared:** This is a Machiavellian principle not present in the text.
*   **C) Mercy tempers power:** While the storm stops, the focus of the sailor's speech is on the efficiency of the prayer, not the quality of mercy.
*   **D) Not all pragmatic advice is diverse or wise:** The sailor's advice *was* pragmatic and wise, so this contradicts the outcome.
*   **E) Urgency in communication is vital:** While communication was urgent, the lesson is specifically about removing unnecessary steps (intermediaries) to ensure success, which is best summarized by the ""shortest and surest way.""

The fable (often attributed to Aesop or similar collections) teaches that going to the source is more effective than relying on proxies.

The mice who lived in the house were always being hunted down by either the snake or the weasel, so when they saw the snake and the ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** Two predators (the snake and the weasel) are preoccupied with fighting each other.
2.  **The Opportunity:** The prey (the mice) assume that because the predators are distracted, it is safe to come out of hiding.
3.  **The Consequence:** The predators immediately set aside their mutual grievance to capitalize on the vulnerability of the mice.
4.  **The Lesson:** The mice made a fatal error by assuming that a conflict between two dangers meant those dangers no longer applied to them. In power struggles or conflicts between strong entities, smaller or weaker parties (bystanders) often find themselves at risk the moment they let their guard down or become visible.

Evaluating the options:
- **A** reflects the reality that the mice (bystanders) suffered when they intervened or became visible during a conflict between more powerful parties.
- **B, C, and E** do not fit the specific mechanics of the predators turning on the mice.
- **D** is a variation of the traditional moral often attributed to this Aesop's fable (sometimes titled ""The Snake, the Weasel, and the Mice""). It emphasizes that when enemies are at war, the ""little people"" should not assume they are safe, as the enemies may unite against a common, easier target. Option A best encapsulates the danger posed to those caught in the orbit of ""powerful parties.""

In many classic translations of this fable, the moral is specifically: ""In a quarrel between the great, the small are often the victims,"" or that one should not rejoice in the discord of enemies if both are still a threat. Choice A aligns most closely with this logic.

'Well!' said the Boy, 'you'll regret it, because you'll never be as well cared for any",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the dialogue and the conflict between the characters:

1.  **The Context**: A Goldfinch has escaped a cage, trading guaranteed food and safety (being ""well cared for"") for independence.
2.  **The Conflict**: The Master (the Boy) warns the bird that life outside will be harder and less comfortable. He equates the cage with security and high-quality care.
3.  **The Bird’s Stance**: The bird acknowledges that the Boy's claim might be true (it might be less ""well cared for"" in the wild), but explicitly states that the ability to ""take care of myself"" (self-determination/liberty) is more valuable than being provided for by someone else.

**Evaluating the options:**
- **A) There is no wealth greater than liberty:** This matches the theme perfectly. The ""wealth"" of the Master’s care is rejected in favor of the ""liberty"" of the wild.
- **B) You should not treat bad people...**: Irrelevant, as there is no indication of ""bad"" or ""good"" people, just a conflict of values.
- **C) Defiance can mask true concern**: This focuses on the Boy, but the moral of a fable usually centers on the central choice made by the protagonist (the bird).
- **D) Changing your location...**: This is a misinterpretation; the change in location (leaving the cage) is what *enabled* the bird's independence.
- **E) Freedom is a treasure worth pursuing, even at great risk**: While this is a common theme, the specific dialogue in this fable focuses more on the *value* of self-sufficiency versus comfort/wealth, making A the most precise fit for the ""care vs. liberty"" trade-off described.

The bird chooses the ""poverty"" of the wild over the ""wealth"" of the cage, illustrating that liberty is the ultimate treasure.

1.  **The Donkey and the Monkey:** Both animals are complaining about lacking features that are common to other animals but are not essential for their basic survival or identity (horns for the donkey, a tail for a specific type of monkey). These can be seen as minor or aesthetic grievances.
2.  **The Mole:** The mole interrupts them to point out a much more significant deprivation: the lack of sight (""deprived of eyes""). 
3.  **The Lesson:** By comparing their minor complaints to the mole's major disability, the story illustrates that our own misfortunes often seem trivial when compared to the much greater struggles faced by others. 
4.  **The Objective:** The mole's interjection is meant to silence their complaining by providing perspective. This aligns with the idea that observing the更大 misfortunes of others can help a person bear their own situation with more patience and less resentment.

Evaluating the options:
- **A** directly reflects this lesson of gaining perspective through the misfortunes of others.
- **B** is about mutual aid (the theme of ""The Donkey and the Ox"").
- **C** is a general truth but doesn't capture the specific ""comparison"" element of the fable.
- **D** describes karma or retribution, which isn't present here.
- **E** focuses on coveting, whereas the animals are complaining about what they lack in a general sense, and the mole's lack is a physical deficiency rather than a ""gift.""

The soup fell out of the long bill of the Cra",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The Fox invites the Crane to dinner but serves the food in a flat dish. This is a ""trick"" because the Fox knows the Crane's long beak makes it impossible for him to eat from a flat surface. The Fox enjoys the Crane’s frustration.
2.  **The Crane's Reaction:** Instead of simply being angry, the Crane retaliates using the exact same logic. He invites the Fox to dinner but serves the food in a long-necked flagon. This suits the Crane's anatomy perfectly but prevents the Fox from eating.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Fox experiences the same frustration she inflicted on the Crane. The text concludes that she met with a ""fitting requital"" based on ""the fashion of her own hospitality.""

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) ""Do unto others...""** This is the Golden Rule. The story shows the negative version of it: if you treat others poorly, you should expect to be treated poorly in return. By acting selfishly, the Fox set the standard for how she herself was eventually treated.
*   **B) Beware the sort of person...** While true in life, the story focuses more on the *consequences* for the trickster rather than a warning to the victim.
*   **C) Cleverness can outwit vexation.** This describes the Crane’s specific tactic, but it doesn't capture the broader ethical lesson regarding mutual treatment.
*   **D) Clever alliance...** This is irrelevant to the plot of the story.
*   **E) Consideration for others' needs...** While the story demonstrates a lack of consideration, the primary lesson is about the *reciprocity* of bad behavior (retribution).

2.  **The Observation**: Upon her return, she complains that even the shepherds and herdsmen (who are outside with their animals from dawn until dusk and barely see her) looks at her with ""aversion.""
3.  **The Conclusion**: The husband concludes that if people who barely saw her (the ""straws"" or small indicators) disliked her, then the people who spent the whole day with her must have found her intolerable.
4.  **The Logic**: Small signs (the shepherds' glances) indicate a much larger truth (her overall character and how she treats everyone). This aligns perfectly with the idiom ""Straws show how the wind blows,"" which means that small signs or hints can indicate a larger trend or a bigger problem.

morables_693,"The coachman, hearing one of the wheels of his coach creak, was surprised; but more especially when he perceived that it was the worst wheel of the whole set, and which he thought had but little prete",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the text step by step:

1.  **Analyze the Characters and Action:** The story features a coachman and a coach wheel. The wheel is described as the ""worst wheel of the whole set""—meaning it is the weakest, most worn, or most defective. Despite being the ""worst,"" it is the one making the most noise (creaking).
2.  **Analyze the Coachman's Reaction:** The coachman is surprised because he expects the strongest wheels to bear the load or perhaps be the ""loudest"" in their utility, but instead, the wheel that contributes the least and is in the poorest condition is the one complaining or making a fuss.
3.  **Identify the Core Theme:** This fable is a variation of a classic Aesop-style trope (often titled ""The Creaking Wheel""). The core observation is that those who are the least capable, the most problematic, or the weakest are often the ones who complain the loudest or demand the most attention.
4.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A) Complaining is the privilege of the weak:** This aligns with the irony that the weakest wheel is the one ""taking the liberty"" to complain (creak). 
    *   **B, C, D:** These do not relate to the specific interaction between the quality of the wheel and its noise.
    *   **E) Noise often masks vulnerability:** While close, ""masking"" implies a deliberate strategy. The fable focuses more on the irony of those who are the most burdensome being the most vocal.

In the context of traditional morality fables (specifically versions by Aesop or Croxall), the ""creaking wheel"" represents those who complain the most despite doing the least or being the least reliable. The phrase ""Complaining is the privilege of the weak"" (or ""Those who do the least work complain the most"") is the standard lesson derived from this specific imagery.

morables_612,"There was a woman of Sybaris who broke a jar. The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, 'I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you'd gone right",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the woman's reaction:

1.  **The Event:** A woman breaks a jar.
2.  **The Reaction of the ""Injured"":** The jar (personified or representing its owner) seeks a witness to build a legal case and assign blame.
3.  **The Woman's Advice:** She points out that instead of focusing on the legalities and the argument of who is right or wrong, the ""jar"" should have prioritized the practical fix (a bandage/repair).

**Step-by-step logic:**
The contrast is between **taking action** to fix a problem (the bandage) and engaging in **litigation or argumentation** (the witness/court case). The woman emphasizes that it is ""wiser"" to minimize damage or seek a cure than to spend time proving a point in a dispute. This aligns with the classic interpretation of Aesop's fables where practical effort is prioritized over useless talk.

- **Option A** (Action is more valuable than arguments) directly addresses this contrast.
- **Option B** is irrelevant to the situation.
- **Option C** is incorrect because the woman herself is being sarcastic; it is her pragmatism that she values over the legal argument.
- **Option D** is overly complex and misidentifies the tone.
- **Option E** does not fit the context of the woman's critique.

Therefore, the story teaches that one should focus on resolving a situation practically rather than winning a verbal or legal battle.

morables_506,"The dolphins and Whales waged a fierce war with each other. When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the interaction between the characters:

1.  **The Conflict**: Large, powerful creatures (dolphins and whales) are engaged in a serious war.
2.  **The Intervener**: A Sprat (a very small, insignificant fish) offers to act as an umpire or mediator to settle the dispute.
3.  **The Reaction**: The Dolphin rejects the offer immediately, stating that they would prefer to continue their destructive war rather than allow someone as lowly as a Sprat to interfere in their business.

**Analysis of the Lessons:**
*   The primary theme is **pride**. The dolphins and whales consider themselves superior and important. Even though their war is destructive, their ego prevents them from accepting help from someone they deem inferior.
*   **Choice A** (Some would rather fight than not) is a bit too broad and misses the nuance of *why* they are fighting (pride).
*   **Choice B** (Adapt to the times) is unrelated to the plot.
*   **Choice C** (Pride often leads to unnecessary conflict) is a strong contender, but if we look at the specific wording of traditional Aesop’s morals for this story, the focus is often on the insignificance of the mediator.
*   **Choice D** (Every fierce, proud man for himself) is a variation of the moral often associated with this fable in classical collections (sometimes phrased as: ""Some men are so proud that in a time of trouble they will not accept the advice or help of those they consider beneath them""). It highlights that a proud man would rather face ruin than accept help from a social inferior.

However, in most standardized tests or traditional interpretations of this specific fable (""The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat""), the central message is that **some people are so arrogant and proud that they would rather perish than be ""saved"" or mediated by someone they despise or look down upon.**

Comparing the choices to the logic of the story:
- The dolphin explicitly states they would ""far rather be destroyed"" than admit interference from a sprat. This is the height of **pride**. 
- Option **C** addresses that pride sustains the conflict unnecessarily.

Looking at common literary interpretations of this specific Aesop fable, the moral is usually: ""Some people of no consequence, in a time of discord, think themselves important."" Or, conversely, that the great would rather suffer than be managed by the small.

Between the options provided, **Choice C** best captures the reason the war continues: the participants' pride makes them reject a peaceful solution, thus leading to ""unnecessary"" continued conflict.

morables_74,"A Man and a Satyr once drank together in token of a bond of alliance being formed between them. One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them. When th",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"In this fable by Aesop, the key element is the Satyr’s reaction to the Man’s inconsistent use of his breath. To the Satyr, using the same ""source"" (the breath) to achieve two diametrically opposite results (warming and cooling) is a sign of duplicity or double-mindedness.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Observation of Inconsistency:** The Man uses his breath to warm his cold hands. Shortly after, he uses the same breath to cool his hot food.
2. **The Satyr's Interpretation:** The Satyr perceives this as a character flaw. He does not see it as practical adaptability, but rather as a sign that the Man is ""double-tongued"" or inconsistent.
3. **The Conclusion:** The Satyr breaks the alliance because he believes a person who can ""blow hot and cold"" (a common idiom originating from this very fable) is inconsistent, untrustworthy, or hypocritical. 
4. **Applying to Human Nature:** In a moral context, this refers to people who change their opinions or allegiances depending on their immediate circumstances or who they are talking to.

Choice **A** directly reflects this lesson: a person who says one thing at one time and the opposite at another (talking for both sides) is unreliable and untrustworthy.

morables_173,"Socrates had erected for himself a very modest house - and I myself would even be willing to die as Socrates died if I could achieve an equal fame, yes, I would be willing to suffer the same public di",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the dialogue and the context provided:

1.  **The Context:** Socrates builds a very small, modest house. A neighbor questions why a man of his stature would live in such a cramped space.
2.  **The Response:** Socrates replies, ""If only I could fill it with true friends!"" 
3.  **The Implication:** By saying he hopes he could fill even a *tiny* house with true friends, Socrates implies that true friends are so rare that he likely won't be able to find enough of them to occupy even a small dwelling. 
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A) True friends are hard to find:** This aligns perfectly with Socrates' witty remark. It highlights the rarity of genuine friendship.
    *   **B) Guilty conscience:** There is no mention of guilt or crime in the fable.
    *   **C) Curiosity fuels wisdom:** While a neighbor asks a question, the focus is on the answer regarding friendship, not the pursuit of knowledge through curiosity.
    *   **D) Modest, philosophical wise man:** This sounds like a critique of Socrates' persona, but it ignores the core sentiment of the punchline about friendship.
    *   **E) Greatness requires hardships:** While the introductory text mentions Socrates' death and future fame, the specific fable (the interaction about the house) is focused on the scarcity of real friends.

Historically, this fable comes from Phaedrus (Book III, Fable 9), titled ""Socrates to his Friends,"" where the explicit point is that many people claim to be friends, but few are sincere.

morables_122,"The lion often found fault with the way he had been designed by Prometheus. Admittedly, Prometheus had made the lion very large and handsome, supplying him with sharp fangs in his jaw and arming him w",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative arc:

1.  **The Lion’s Complaint:** Despite being the most powerful and handsome animal created by Prometheus, the lion is miserable because he has one specific, seemingly irrational fear: roosters. He is so ashamed of this ""weakness"" that he wishes to die.
2.  **The Comparison:** The lion meets an elephant, an animal even larger than himself. He notices the elephant is terrified of a tiny gnat.
3.  **The Realization:** The lion realizes that even the mightiest creatures have vulnerabilities. He concludes that his situation is actually better than the elephant's (""I am... in much better shape than this elephant""), which alleviates his shame and restores his self-worth.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) There is always someone else worse off than you:** This aligns with the lion's conclusion. He stops feeling suicidal once he realizes the elephant has a similar (and in his eyes, more pathetic) problem. 
*   **B) No matter how you brag, you can be undone:** The lion wasn't bragging; he was self-deprecating.
*   **C) Strength alone does not guarantee invulnerability:** While true in the story, the lion's specific takeaway is not about caution, but about finding comfort/perspective by looking at others' struggles.
*   **D) You may share the labours...:** This is a moral for a different fable (usually ""The Lion's Share"").
*   **E) Even divine gifts can spark envy:** The lion wasn't envious of others; he was ashamed of himself until he saw the elephant.

The fable teaches that perspective is key; we often focus on our own flaws until we see that others—even those who seem superior or equal—struggle with their own difficulties.

morables_169,"The crow was making a sacrifice to Athena and invited a dog to the feast. The dog said to her, 'Why do you foolishly squander these sacrifices? The goddess clearly hates you so much that she has taken",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the dialogue between the dog and the crow:

1.  **The Conflict:** The dog points out that the crow’s sacrifices are ""foolish"" because Athena (the goddess of wisdom) has already shown her displeasure by making the crow’s omens unreliable/discredited. In the dog's view, the crow is wasting resources on someone who dislikes her.
2.  **The Crow’s Reasoning:** The crow explicitly states that her bad standing with Athena is the exact reason she is making the sacrifice. She isn't acting out of love or tradition, but out of a calculated attempt to change the goddess's mind (""I hope she will change her attitude towards me"").
3.  **The Lesson:** This fable highlights a common human behavior: people often go out of their way to appease or be generous toward those who are currently their enemies or who hold power over them, specifically to win favor or neutralize a threat.

Evaluating the options:
- **A** directly reflects the crow’s motivation: treating an ""enemy"" (or someone hostile) well to gain a better outcome.
- **B** and **E** are irrelevant to the text.
- **C** is a superficial reading that ignores the transactional nature of the sacrifice.
- **D** is factually disconnected from the crow's behavior (she lacks the ""critical means"" as her omens are already discredited).

Historically, this Aesop's fable (Perry Index 128) is interpreted as a commentary on those who try to buy the favor of their enemies or those who despise them.

morables_418,"They say that the hyena has a double nature: for a period of time the hyena is male, and then later on she is female. The story goes that when a male hyena was treating a female badly, she said to him",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"In this fable, derived from Aesop, the key element is the cyclical role reversal: the hyena currently being mistreated (the female) will eventually occupy the position of the one currently mistreating her (the male). 

1.  **Analyze the narrative:** The female hyena warns the male that their statuses will flip. Her warning is a reminder that positions of power and subjection are temporary.
2.  **Evaluate the options:**
    *   **A) People who have been judged in the past can later on be in a position to judge their former teachers.** This captures the essence of role reversal and the warning that those currently in power/authority should treat others well because they may one day be subject to those same people. While ""teachers"" is a specific application (often found in translations of this fable referring to ""those who have been taught""), the core concept is about the reversal of status.
    *   **B), C), E):** These themes (flattery, adversity, or personal potential) are not supported by the dialogue or the specific ""double nature"" mechanic of the story.
    *   **D) Double-natured ambiguity...** focuses on mistrust, whereas the story focuses on the consequences of mistreatment during a temporary position of power.

In many classical collections (such as the Perry Index), the moral of this specific fable is that if you are in a position of authority or power, you should treat your subordinates well because the roles may one day be reversed. Option A is the closest representation of this ""reversal of roles"" lesson.

morables_227,"A lion was wandering on the seashore when he saw a dolphin stick his head out of the water. The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the conflict:

1.  **The Agreement:** The lion (king of the land) and the dolphin (king of the sea) form an alliance based on their status and shared authority over their respective domains.
2.  **The Peril:** The lion enters a battle with a wild bull and calls upon his ally for help.
3.  **The Failure:** The dolphin wants to help but is physically unable to leave the water. The alliance fails precisely when it is needed most.
4.  **The Lesson:** The lion feels betrayed, but the dolphin points out that his nature (being a sea creature) makes it impossible for him to assist on land.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **B, C, and D** do not fit the narrative. There was no betrayal of intent (only an inability to act), and the story is focused on the practical limitations of the alliance rather than ""regal might"" or ""wild adversaries.""
*   **E** is a decent observation, but it is less specific than the traditional Aesopic lesson.
*   **A** directly addresses the failure of the alliance. The lion chose an ally based on prestige (""King of the Sea"") rather than a practical assessment of whether that ally could actually assist him during a conflict on land (""moments of peril"").

In historical translations of Aesop's fables, this specific story (The Lion and the Dolphin) is used to teach that when choosing allies, we should look for those who have the capacity to help us in our times of need, rather than just choosing those who seem impressive or equal in rank.

1.  **The Situation:** A fox tries to deceive a cicada into coming down from a tree to eat it, using flattery and curiosity as a ruse.
2.  **The Resolution:** The cicada is not fooled. It tests the fox by dropping a leaf, confirming the fox's predatory intent when the fox pounces.
3.  **The Lesson:** The cicada explicitly states why it was prepared: ""I've been on my guard against foxes ever since I saw the wings of a cicada in the spoor of a fox.""
4.  **Analysis:** The cicada learned to be cautious and wise not through its own near-death experience, but by observing what happened to others of its kind (the wings in the fox's droppings). This observation allowed the cicada to avoid a similar misfortune.

- **Choice A** aligns perfectly with this: ""A discerning person is made wise by the misfortunes of his neighbours."" The cicada saw the ""misfortune"" of a previous cicada and used that knowledge to protect itself.
- **Choice B** is irrelevant to the text.
- **Choice C** describes the fox's action but doesn't capture the lesson learned by the protagonist.
- **Choice D** describes a self-fulfilling prophecy (the ""Oedipus"" trope), which is the opposite of what happens here; the cicada's caution successfully *averts* fate.
- **Choice E** is a true statement about the fox, but the ""moral"" of Aesop-style fables usually focuses on the wisdom gained or the warning provided by the outcome.

The Wolf, who lay lurking just by, heard this",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The setup**: The mother Goat gives her Kid a specific instruction (a ""charge"") to be cautious and not open the door to anyone.
2.  **The conflict**: The Wolf attempts to deceive the Kid by ""counterfeiting"" the mother's voice. This is an act of hypocrisy—pretending to be something he is not to gain entry.
3.  **The resolution**: The Kid performs a secondary check (looking out the window) and realizes that while the voice sounds right, the physical appearance reveals the truth.
4.  **The lesson**: The Kid identifies the ""cheat."" The story illustrates that an impostor or a hypocrite may try to disguise one trait (the voice), but their true nature or other inconsistencies (the appearance) will eventually expose them to those who are vigilant.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) A hypocrite can usually be found out:** This directly matches the outcome where the Wolf's disguise is seen through by the Kid.
*   **B) Concerns about demise:** This does not fit the plot of the story.
*   **C) Caring hearts:** While the Kid is cautious, the story is more about discernment and spotting a lie than about ""caring hearts.""
*   **D) Cautious arguments/cowards:** This relates to a different Aesop fable (*The Mountain in Labour* or *The Wolf and the Sheep*).
*   **E) Neglecting oversight:** The Mother Goat actually successfully provided oversight/instructions; the story is about the Kid following them and detecting a lie.

Apollo immediately explained to the snake, 'If you had simply killed the first person who ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the interaction between the snake and Apollo:

1.  **The Context:** The snake is suffering because it has been repeatedly stepped on by many people. It seeks refuge or an explanation in the temple.
2.  **Apollo's Lesson:** Apollo tells the snake that the reason people continue to step on it is because there was no consequence for the very first person who did so. Had the snake retaliated immediately against the first offender, word would have spread (or the deterrent would have been established), and others would have feared to repeat the action.
3.  **The Principle:** The story emphasizes that if a transgression is met with immediate and decisive punishment (or a show of force), it prevents others from attempting the same transgression. This is a classic lesson in **deterrence**.

Looking at the options:
*   **A)** Aligns perfectly with the concept of deterrence. By punishing the first offender swiftly, others are frightened and discouraged from committing the same ""crime"" (stepping on the snake).
*   **B)** Focuses on ""wicked people"" and delayed punishment, which contradicts Apollo's advice for immediate action.
*   **C)** Suggests immediate action is bad, while the story suggests it was necessary.
*   **D)** Focuses on ""cleverness"" vs. ""force,"" but the snake’s issue was a lack of using its natural force (striking) to defend itself.
*   **E)** Focuses on the sanctuary, which is the setting but not the lesson.

The moral is that swift retribution serves as a deterrent to others.

'I would agree,' the lion said, 'if you were not already in the habit of taking what",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions between the lion and the two characters:

1.  **The Robber:** He approaches with a sense of entitlement (""demanded"") and an established reputation for taking things by force. The lion rejects him because his character is defined by greed and theft.
2.  **The Wayfarer:** He approaches with humility and caution (backing away), showing respect for the lion's power and rightful claim over the prey. The lion rewards this lack of aggression and modesty with kindness and a share of the meal.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between the robber (force/resistance) and the wayfarer (humility/generosity).
*   **B:** While the robber is untrustworthy, the story focuses more on the *reward* of the modest man rather than the *betrayal* of a friend.
*   **C:** This is close, but the wayfarer didn't ""tame"" the lion through action; rather, the lion rewarded his existing temperament.
*   **D:** This doesn't fit, as the villain was not cunning and did not outwit anyone; he was rejected.
*   **E:** This describes the robber's perspective, but the fable's primary lesson is found in the outcome for both men (the contrast).

1.  **The Action:** A man spends excessive amounts of money on religious sacrifices at a hero shrine.
2.  **The Potential Consequence:** The man is at risk of becoming poor because of his own ""squandering"" and ""spending great sums.""
3.  **The Intervention:** The god/hero appears to warn the man.
4.  **The Lesson:** The god explicitly points out that if the man becomes poor due to his own financial choices (spending everything on the shrine), he will likely shift the responsibility and blame the deity for his misfortune rather than his own lack of moderation.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses the god's warning: that people create their own problems through foolishness (overspending) and then blame divine forces.
*   **B** refers to promises, which are not mentioned.
*   **C** talks about counsel (advice) being clouded, but the advice here is actually being given by the god to clear up the man's behavior.
*   **D** suggests a profit motive, which doesn't fit the man's ""squandering.""
*   **E** focuses on heart-felt devotion versus ritual, but the god's specific concern is about the future attribution of blame.

1.  **The Conflict of Value:** The stag looks at himself and makes a judgment based on aesthetics. He dislikes his legs because they are ""slender"" (unattractive to him) but admires his horns because of their ""shape and size"" (impressive/grand).
2.  **The Test of Utility:** When the hunters arrive, the ""ugly"" legs perform the vital function of saving his life by outrunning the pursuers. The ""beautiful"" horns, however, become a physical hindrance by getting caught in the branches.
3.  **The Realization:** At the moment of his capture, the stag explicitly states the lesson: the thing he criticized (his legs) was his means of salvation, while the thing he took pride in (his horns) caused his destruction.
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A:** Correct. This captures the essence of the stag's realization—his legs were ""most truly valuable"" in a life-or-death situation, yet he ""underrated"" them because of how they looked.
    *   **B:** While the stag was proud, the story isn't primarily about ""greed"" for honor, but rather a misjudgment of what is useful versus what is ornamental.
    *   **C:** Persistence is not a major theme; the stag runs efficiently, but the failure is due to a physical snag, not a lack of persistence.
    *   **D:** There are no ""deceivers"" in this story; it is an internal realization.
    *   **E:** This is a strong candidate, but ""underrated value"" (Option A) more precisely matches the stag's regret about disparaging his legs, which were his actual strength.

The story teaches that we often value things based on appearance rather than utility, and what is truly helpful is often overlooked or under-appreciated.

But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Eagle, a symbol of power and strength, dismisses the Beetle (a small, seemingly insignificant insect) and rudely knocks her aside while killing the Hare the Beetle was protecting.
2.  **The Revenge:** Despite being small, the Beetle is persistent and clever. She systematically destroys the Eagle's eggs, even when the Eagle seeks the highest protection (Jupiter, the king of the gods).
3.  **The Resolution:** Jupiter realizes the Beetle was justified in her revenge because the Eagle had wronged her and ignored her plea.
4.  **The Theme:** The story centers on the idea that no one is so powerful that they can afford to disregard or insult the weak, because even the smallest creature can find a way to retaliate.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) The weak may find a way to avenge a wrong.** This directly matches the Beetle's actions and the outcome of the story.
*   **B) Greed and honor.** There is no theme of greed for honor in this specific fable.
*   **C) Restraint.** While the Eagle lacked restraint, the core of the story is the Beetle's revenge.
*   **D) Beauty and leadership.** This is not relevant to the characters described.
*   **E) Compassion between predator and prey.** The Beetle (the protector) and the Eagle (the predator) never find common ground; they remain at odds until Jupiter intervenes to change the timing of their life cycles.

The most accurate moral is that the weak can still overcome or avenge themselves against the strong.

At a certain m",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Accident:** The donkey accidentally falls into the stream, and the salt dissolves. This teaches the donkey that he can lighten his load through a specific action (falling in the water).
2.  **The Deception:** The donkey intentionally repeats the action to avoid work. He ""fools"" the merchant once.
3.  **The Discovery:** The merchant is observant. He realizes the donkey is tricking him and devises a counter-strategy.
4.  **The Consequence:** The donkey tries the trick a second time, but the merchant has changed the circumstances (from salt to sponges). Instead of lightening the load, the donkey’s trick backfires, making the burden twice as heavy.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) You can fool someone only so many times:** This fits perfectly. The donkey successfully deceived the merchant once, but the merchant caught on and punished the trickery the next time. It highlights that deceit is unsustainable once the victim becomes aware.
*   **B) Value is what others think...:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C) Cunning minds see wicked traps:** This is close but slightly misaligned; it was the merchant's cunning that created the ""trap"" to counter the donkey's wickedness.
*   **D) Everyone should be satisfied...:** While Aesop’s fables often touch on being content with one's lot, the wording is overly complex and does not fit the specific resolution of this story as well as option A.
*   **E) Sometimes, accidents can lighten the load...:** This describes the initial incident but ignores the rest of the story and the ultimate lesson about deception.

The core lesson is that a trick used to avoid duty will eventually be discovered and turned against the trickster.

Even after stroking the animal he was not sure of its i,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Character's Ability:** The protagonist is a blind man who relies on touch and intuition to understand the nature of things. This suggests a focus on sensing the ""essence"" or ""character"" of a creature rather than its visual appearance.
2.  **The Subject:** He is presented with a wolf cub. A cub is the ""early life"" stage of a predator.
3.  **The Conflict/Doubt:** While the man cannot pin down the exact species (wolf vs. fox), he immediately senses a dangerous nature or a specific predisposition.
4.  **The Conclusion:** He realizes that regardless of its specific name, the animal possesses a nature unsuitable for being around a flock of sheep. He recognizes the inherent danger/malice in the creature even before it is fully grown or has committed an act of predation.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Evil tendencies are shown in early life:** This aligns perfectly with the story. Even as a cub, the wolf's nature is recognizable to the perceptive man. This is the classical moral attributed to this Aesop's fable.
*   **B) Harsh means:** There is no mention of punishment or discipline in the text.
*   **C) Appearances can be misleading:** While true in some contexts, the man is blind, so he isn't being misled by ""appearances"" in the traditional sense; rather, he is sensing the innate nature.
*   **D) Reward and punishment:** The story doesn't involve a choice to reward or punish, but rather an observation of character.
*   **E) Familiar concealing truth:** The cub is not necessarily ""familiar"" to the man in a way that hides its danger; he actually identifies the danger quite quickly.

The fable emphasizes that one's nature is evident from the beginning, even before it has fully manifested in adult behavior.

This man noticed that all sorts of people came to him, and he became curious to see who were true friend",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"The story describes a man who uses a ""test of hardship"" to distinguish between those who enjoy his benefits (freeloaders/hangers-on) and those who are truly loyal to him.

1.  **Analyze the Plot**: The Rich Man provides for everyone, resulting in a ""full table."" This shows that generosity attracts a crowd.
2.  **Analyze the Conflict**: When the Rich Man asks for a sacrifice or a risk (standing by him with swords), almost everyone abandons him.
3.  **Analyze the Outcome**: Out of a large group, only two remain. The text explicitly contrasts ""true friends"" with ""hangers-on.""
4.  **Evaluate the Options**:
    *   **A**: This is a common sentiment, but the story is more specifically about the *test* of friendship in times of trouble.
    *   **B**: This is irrelevant to the plot.
    *   **C**: This is a practical takeaway for the host, but doesn't capture the essence of the ""test.""
    *   **D**: This aligns with the behavior of the guests (the ""excuses""), but focuses only on the negative side.
    *   **E**: This captures the full arc of the story: his generosity brought the guests (""attracts company""), but only sincerity/true friendship survived the test (""sincerity keeps it""). 

In the context of Aesop-style fables (from which this narrative is derived), the focus is often on how adversity or a demand for loyalty reveals the scarcity of genuine character versus those who are only there for the ""feast."" Option A is the most fundamental lesson: among a multitude of associates, very few are actually genuine.

The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, 'Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch m",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the text step by step:

1.  **The Characters:** The story features two pots in a river: one made of **earthenware** (fragile, easily broken) and one made of **brass** (strong, hard, durable).
2.  **The Conflict:** The pots are being tossed about in the same current. The earthenware pot recognizes that any contact between the two will result in its destruction, whereas the brass pot would remain unharmed.
3.  **The Dialogue:** The earthenware pot asks for distance, acknowledging that it cannot coexist safely with someone so much stronger or ""harder"" than itself in a volatile situation.
4.  **The Lesson:** This fable (often attributed to Aesop) illustrates that a relationship between the powerful/strong and the weak/fragile is inherently dangerous for the weaker party. Therefore, it is best to associate with those who are your equals in terms of status or vulnerability to avoid being crushed.

*   **Option A** directly addresses this theme: ""Equals make the best friends"" (or ""The strong and the weak cannot keep company"").
*   **Option B** focuses on ego, which isn't the primary point (the pot is actually being very realistic about its worth/fragility).
*   **Option C and E** are modern, inclusive interpretations that do not align with the traditional cautionary nature of this specific fable.
*   **Option D** is a garbled phrase not related to the core lesson.

Historically, this fable (""The Two Pots"") concludes with the moral that the poor or weak should avoid the company of the rich or powerful, summarized as: **Equals make the best friends.**

The wild boar replied, 'I have",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Situation:** The wild boar is sharpening his tusks even though there is no current enemy or danger in sight.
2.  **The Question:** The fox questions the necessity of the task, implying that it is a waste of time to prepare when there is no ""immediate need.""
3.  **The Lesson:** The boar explains that if he waits until danger arrives, it will be too late to prepare; he must be ready beforehand so he can act immediately when the threat appears.

**Evaluating the Options:**
- **A) Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace:** This aligns with the theme of preparing ""weapons"" (tusks) during times of calm to ensure safety during times of conflict. It reflects the classic Latin adage *Si vis pacem, para bellum* (If you want peace, prepare for war).
- **B) God is the ultimate judge:** There is no religious or judicial context in this story.
- **C) Curiosity must be guided by prudence:** This focuses on the fox, but the ""hero"" of the story is the boar, whose proactive behavior is the focus.
- **D) Prudent men feel worst when they contribute to their own inquisitive undoing:** This is too complex and doesn't fit the narrative.
- **E) Even nature prepares its own defenses:** While true, ""A"" provides a more traditional moralistic interpretation of the fable's intent regarding human (and animal) foresight.

The core lesson is that it is better to be prepared for trouble before it arrives than to try to prepare once it is already there.

When the depositor then summoned him to swear an oath regarding the deposit, he realized the danger he was in and prepar",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the dialogue between the man and the god, Oath:

1.  **The Context:** A man intends to commit perjury (swearing a false oath) to steal a deposit. He encounters the god Oath, who claims he only revisits cities every thirty or forty years.
2.  **The Action:** Believing he has decades before he will face divine retribution, the man immediately commits the crime, thinking he is safe from discovery or punishment in his lifetime.
3.  **The Turn:** The god reappears the very next day to punish him.
4.  **The Lesson:** When the man protests, citing the ""thirty-year"" rule, the god explains that for those who intentionally provoke or mock him (by sinning specifically because they think they won't be caught), he can return at any moment, even the same day.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the god's explanation. The man thought there was a ""fixed day"" (30 years away), but the god reveals that punishment is unpredictable and can happen anytime.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there is no comparison between a man and a crowd.
*   **C:** While the man's fear led him to seek information, the story is more about the unpredictability of divine justice than a general distortion of truth.
*   **D:** This concerns the incitement of strife, which is not the primary theme of perjury and divine punishment.
*   **E:** While technically true in a general sense, the specific punchline of the fable focuses on the timing of punishment, not the state of the man's conscience.

The fable (attributed to Aesop) serves as a warning that divine retribution is not on a predictable schedule and that those who try to ""game the system"" of morality will be caught when they least expect it.

1.  **Initial Situation**: The farmer realizes the grain is ripe but decides to wait for his neighbors to help him. The mother Lark remains calm because she knows that relying on others usually leads to delay.
2.  **The Turning Point**: The farmer realizes the grain is falling from the stalks (wasting) because his friends didn't show up. He decides that *he* will hire laborers and do the work *himself*.
3.  **The Lark's Reaction**: Only when the man decides to take personal responsibility for the task does the mother Lark realize the danger is imminent and it is time to leave.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Self-help is the best help:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The harvest only moves forward when the owner stops waiting for others and takes initiative himself.
*   **B) Cunning often outwits itself:** There is no ""cunning"" or trickery involved in this story.
*   **C) Wisdom grows with determination:** While the farmer learns a lesson, the core of the story is about the reliability of self-reliance versus the unreliability of others.
*   **D) Do unto others...**: This is the Golden Rule, but it doesn't apply to the farmer's logistical problem.
*   **E) Even the tiniest cradle...**: This is a poetic sentiment about the nest, but it ignores the central conflict of the harvest.

1.  **The Situation:** Aesop (a sage) is seen engaging in lighthearted play (marbles). An observer assumes this play is a sign of madness or lack of intelligence.
2.  **The Challenge:** Aesop uses an unstrung bow as a riddle. The observer, despite considering himself smart (""know-it-all""), cannot solve it.
3.  **The Metaphor:** Aesop explains that a bow kept under constant tension (tightly strung) will eventually break. To remain functional and strong, the bow must be unstrung and allowed to rest.
4.  **The Lesson:** Aesop is comparing the human mind and spirit to the bow. Constant serious work or intellectual strain leads to ""breaking"" (burnout or loss of efficacy). Play and relaxation are not signs of madness, but a necessary ""unstringing"" that preserves one's strength for when it is needed.

**Evaluation of choices:**
*   **B** and **C** are largely unrelated to the bow metaphor.
*   **D** describes Aesop's actions, but it is not the universal lesson of the bow.
*   **E** is a secondary observation (Aesop was wise despite appearing playful), but it doesn't capture the specific mechanical lesson of the bow explanation.
*   **A** directly addresses the explanation given by Aesop: one must rest to remain useful and clear-headed.

'I breed only one,' said the lioness, 'but he is very ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the sow and the lioness:

1.  **Analyze the Characters:** The sow is characterized by her ability to produce a large number of offspring (a ""whole litter""). She uses this number to boast or ""accost"" the lioness, implying that her high volume of production makes her superior.
2.  **Analyze the Rebuttal:** The lioness acknowledges that she only produces one offspring at a time. However, she distinguishes her single cub by its quality (""well bred""). In the context of the animal kingdom, a single lion is a creature of high status and power, whereas a piglet is common.
3.  **Identify the Contrast:** The fable sets up a direct contrast between the **quantity** of the sow’s piglets and the **quality** of the lioness’s cub.
4.  **Evaluate the Moral:** 
    *   (A) directly addresses this contrast: Quality is more valuable than quantity.
    *   (B) mentions gossip, which isn't the central theme.
    *   (C) mentions humility, but the lioness is actually being quite proud/confident herself.
    *   (D) discusses safety and jeopardy, which are not the focus of this verbal exchange.
    *   (E) discusses nurturing, but the focus is on the inherent nature/value of the offspring.

The lioness's statement ""only one, but a lion"" (or ""well bred"" in this version) is a classic illustration that one excellent thing is worth more than many mediocre things.

1.  **Running swiftly / Balancing on the razor's edge:** This suggests that opportunity is fleeting and exists only for a precise, precarious moment.
2.  **A lock of hair on his forehead / Bald in the back:** This is a metaphorical anatomical description. If you see him coming toward you, you can grab the lock of hair (the opportunity). However, once he passes, his head is bald, meaning there is nothing left to grab hold of.
3.  **Not even Jupiter himself can pull him back:** This emphasizes that once a moment is lost, it is permanent; no amount of power or divinity can restore a missed chance.
4.  **The explicit explanation:** The text concludes by stating this is a ""symbol of Opportunity, the brief moment in which things are possible.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Seize opportunities when they arise:** This aligns perfectly with the imagery of grabbing the forelock before the figure passes.
*   **B) Be content with your lot:** The text encourages action, not contentment with the current state.
*   **C) Power without purpose is ineffectual:** While Jupiter is mentioned, the focus is on the nature of time and timing, not the application of power.
*   **D) Boast of one powerful thing...:** This relates to a different type of fable (like Aesop's ""The Fox and the Cat"") and does not fit this text.
*   **E) Every daring act teeters on the fine line...:** While the figure balances on a razor's edge, the moral focuses on the *impermanence* of the moment rather than the psychological state of bravery.

The lesson is clear: because opportunity is fleeting and cannot be caught once it has passed, one must act immediately.

He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Fox's Behavior:** The fox identifies a danger (the trap) but chooses not to warn the wolf. Instead, she uses ""flattery"" and false kindness, calling the wolf a ""dearest friend"" to lure him into a situation that benefits her (by springing the trap safely so she can potentially get the meat later, or simply out of malice).
2.  **The wolf's Mistake:** The wolf takes the fox’s words at face value. He believes the ""gift"" is an act of friendship, only to be harmed by the hidden trap.
3.  **The Resolution:** The wolf realizes that the fox’s friendly words were a mask for deception.

Now, let's look at the options:
*   **A) Flatterers and deceivers are not to be trusted:** This fits perfectly. The fox used flattering language (""dearest friend"") to deceive the wolf into a trap.
*   **B) Know yourself and your limits:** This doesn't apply; the wolf's issue wasn't a lack of ability, but a lack of discernment regarding the fox's intent.
*   **C) Trust can be a double-edged sword:** While true, it is less specific to the ""fox and wolf"" dynamic which focuses on the fox's active deception.
*   **D) A single reliable skill...:** This is the moral of the ""Fox and the Cat,"" not this specific fable.
*   **E) Caution is wise...:** The story actually shows that collaboration (in this case) led to injury, not new paths.

The story warns the reader that those who offer ""gifts"" or ""favors"" with excessive flattery often have ulterior motives.

1.  **The Promise**: One dung beetle promises to bring food back to his friend if he finds a good feeding ground on the mainland. This promise is made when they are together and the prospect of abundance seems achievable.
2.  **The Situation**: The beetle finds plenty of food (moist, fresh manure) and becomes fat and healthy during the winter.
3.  **The Failure**: When the beetle returns, he arrives empty-handed. He blames the nature of the environment (""the food cannot be taken away""), essentially admitting that the promise he made was impossible to fulfill because of the nature of the resource he was seeking.
4.  **The Lesson**: The beetle made a grand promise during a time of transition or ""good times"" (planning for the future) that he ultimately could not or would not keep once he was actually enjoying the benefits. It serves as a warning about trusting promises that sound good but are made without a realistic understanding of the circumstances or by those who may forget their obligations once they are satisfied.

3.  **The Reasoning:** The second frog realizes that while the well provides immediate water, its depth makes it a trap if that water also disappears.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story emphasizes the importance of considering the consequences of an action before committing to it, especially when that action is difficult to reverse.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Look before you leap:** This is a literal and metaphorical fit. The frog is literally looking into a well before leaping and figuratively considering the future.
*   **B) Watch the actions of your enemy:** There are no enemies in this story.
*   **C) Haste often leads to regret:** While true, this is a broader result; ""Look before you leap"" specifically addresses the preventive wisdom shown by the second frog.
*   **D) Impulsive, vicious people...:** This describes a different type of fable (like *The Scorpion and the Frog*); there is no malice here.
*   **E) Adaptability is key:** The frogs are trying to adapt, but the story focuses more on foresight than the act of adaptation itself.

In Aesop's Fables, this specific story is the origin of the proverb ""Look before you leap.""

morables_368,"Thanks to his excellent qualities, Hercules was received into heaven. He saluted the gods who came to congratulate him one after another, but when he was approached by Plutus, the god of wealth and th",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the key elements of the story:

1.  **The Characters**: Hercules represents virtue, physical excellence, and heroism. He has earned his place in heaven through his ""excellent qualities."" Plutus represents wealth and fortune.
2.  **The Conflict**: Hercules accepts greetings from all the gods except Plutus. He deliberately turns away from him.
3.  **The Reasoning**: When questioned by Jupiter, Hercules explains that he hates Plutus because he is ""a friend to the wicked"" and ""corrupts the entire world.""
4.  **The Lesson**: The story contrasts true merit (Hercules' virtue) with the corruptive nature of money. Hercules' disdain for Plutus suggests that wealth is often associated with vice and that material riches do not align with the purity of spirit or excellence required for divine favor.

Looking at the options:
- **A**: This relates to the idea that money corrupts ""honest traffic,"" which aligns with Hercules' complaint about wealth corrupting the world.
- **B**: This focuses on the threat to the rich themselves, which isn't the primary focus here.
- **C**: This is a common theme, as Hercules reached heaven through his qualities, not money.
- **D**: This focuses on thieves, which is not the subject of the story.
- **E**: This focuses on Hercules' ascent via virtue.

Historically, this specific Aesop's fable (often titled ""Hercules and Plutus"") is used to illustrate that while riches may be widely sought, they are often the companions of the wicked and can undermine true virtue. Between the options provided, Option A (often a traditional translation of the moral for this specific fable: *""pecunia vero obstat, ne ad veras laudes perveniatur""*) focuses on how money interferes with or ""puts a stop to"" the honest distribution of praise or merit. 

However, in the context of Hercules’ specific speech—where he explicitly rejects the ""friend to the wicked""—the most direct moral is that **wealth is the companion of the wicked** and does not equate to or facilitate true virtue. In many standardized versions of this fable text, **Option A** is the classical interpretation assigned to it.

morables_301,"A dog made false accusations against the sheep, demanding that she pay him back a loaf of bread which, he insisted, the sheep had supposedly borrowed from him. The dog summoned the wolf as his witness",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s look at the plot and the resolution:

1.  **The Conflict:** A dog makes a false accusation against an innocent sheep.
2.  **The Deception:** A wolf provides false testimony (perjury) to ensure the sheep is wrongfully convicted and punished.
3.  **The Resolution:** Shortly after the injustice occurs, the wolf (the liar) is found dead in a ditch.
4.  **The Lesson:** The sheep explicitly states the theme: ""This is the reward that gods give to liars."" 

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Wicked liars generally get their just consequences:** This aligns perfectly with the sheep's concluding statement and the wolf's fate. It reflects the concept of ""poetic justice"" or divine retribution for dishonesty.
*   **B) Harsh means:** The story is about injustice and lies, not about discipline or education.
*   **C) Masking innocence:** While the wolf and dog mask the sheep's innocence with lies, the focus of the ending is on the *fate* of the liar.
*   **D) Inviting insults:** The sheep was a victim of a conspiracy, not someone who ""put up"" with an initial insult to invite more.
*   **E) Fabric of trust:** While true in a general sense, the fable specifically focuses on the punishment of the perpetrator rather than the societal impact on trust.

The story serves as a warning that those who use lies to harm others will eventually face their own ruin.

morables_428,"A Lark, caught in a snare, pleaded earnestly with the Fowler for her life. 'What have I done that I must die?' said she; 'I have stolen neither gold nor silver, but only a grain of corn to satisfy my ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the relationship between the characters and the outcome:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Lark is trapped by the Fowler. The Lark tries to argue her innocence and the insignificance of her ""crime"" (eating a grain of corn) to save her life. 
2.  **The Dynamic:** The Fowler is the one who caught the Lark; he acts as both the adversary (the one who wants to kill her) and the judge (the one who decides if her plea for mercy is valid).
3.  **The Outcome:** The Fowler ignores the logic and pleading, remaining silent and proceeding to kill the Lark. This demonstrates that when the person you are pleading with has already decided your fate to benefit themselves, rational arguments or pleas for justice are futile.

Looking at the options:
*   **A)** This directly reflects the futility of the Lark's plea given the Fowler’s dual role as captor and executioner.
*   **B)** This focuses on the Lark's mistake, but the story emphasizes the Fowler's cold response to the Lark's plea.
*   **C)** This is the opposite of what happened; silence was merciless.
*   **D)** This is unnecessarily convoluted and doesn't fit the narrative flow.
*   **E)** This is contradicted by the text, as sincerity failed to save the Lark.

The story belongs to the tradition of Aesop’s Fables, where the lesson often points to the harsh reality that the powerful do not listen to the logic of the weak.

morables_82,"Be quiet now, said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap. If you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf. Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events:

1.  **The Situation:** An old nurse threatens a child that she will throw him to the wolf if he continues to be noisy.
2.  **The Listening Party:** A wolf overhears this threat and believes it to be a sincere promise. He waits patiently for the child to cry so he can receive his meal.
3.  **The Outcome:** When the child finally cries and the wolf presents himself to collect his ""morsel,"" the nurse does the exact opposite of what she said—she shuts the window and calls for dogs to attack the wolf.
4.  **The Lesson:** The wolf's mistake was believing the words of someone who considered him an enemy. The nurse's threat was empty rhetoric, never intended to be fulfilled. In Aesop's fables (this is a variation of ""The Wolf and the Nurse""), the primary lesson is that one should not trust the words or ""promises"" of an enemy, as they are often deceptive or meaningless.

Looking at the options:
*   **A)** Correct. The ""promise"" (or threat) made by the nurse was not something the wolf should have relied upon.
*   **B)** Irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C)** The plan didn't silence fear; it invited danger.
*   **D)** The wolf wasn't serving anyone; he was acting on his own greed.
*   **E)** While the nurse was protecting the child, this is a literal interpretation rather than a traditional moral.

The traditional moral for this specific fable is that the promises of enemies (or those who fear/hate you) are not to be trusted.

Then the fly laughed at the man and said, 'You wanted to avenge the sting of a ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the conflict between the man and the fly:

1.  **The Conflict:** The fly mocks the man for hitting himself while trying to kill the fly, suggesting that the ""insult"" (the slap) is worse than the original ""injury"" (the bite).
2.  **The Man's Defense:** The man explicitly distinguishes between his actions and the fly's actions based on **intent**.
3.  **The Core Logic:** He forgives himself for the self-inflicted slap because he ""did not try to hurt [himself] on purpose."" Conversely, he remains committed to destroying the fly despite the physical pain he causes himself, because the fly's intent is malicious (drinking blood).

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Intent matters more than the outcome:** This aligns perfectly with the man's argument. He justifies the painful slap (the outcome) by citing his lack of harmful intent toward himself, while condemning the fly for its nature and purpose. This is the classic moral of the Phaedrus version of this fable.
*   **B) Sharing/Rudeness:** Not relevant to the themes of this story.
*   **C) Forgiveness vs. Mockery:** While the man forgives himself, the story is more about the justification of his actions than a general lesson on forgiveness.
*   **D) Frustrated self-effort:** This is too vague and doesn't capture the man's specific reasoning.
*   **E) Anger/Self-harm:** While it is true the man harmed himself, the text portrays the man's decision as a conscious choice (""I would be glad to get rid of you even if it required an even greater inconvenience"") rather than a cautionary tale against losing one's temper. The man wins the verbal exchange by asserting that his intent justifies the effort.

The story emphasizes that while an accidental self-inflicted blow is excusable, a malicious act from an enemy is not, and the sacrifice made to stop an enemy is worth the ""inconvenience.""

The Hunter agreed, but said: 'If you desire to conquer the Stag, you mus",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Horse wants revenge on the Stag but cannot achieve it alone.
2.  **The Deal:** The Horse seeks the Hunter's help. The Hunter agrees but demands total control (the bit, the bridle, and the saddle) as a condition for his assistance.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Horse achieves his goal (defeating the Stag), but in doing so, he has permanently surrendered his independence. The Hunter now refuses to let him go because he finds the Horse's servitude useful.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** While the Hunter does use the Horse for his own purposes, the core lesson emphasizes the specific danger of surrendering one's liberty to settle a score.
*   **B:** This is the classic moral associated with this Aesop fable (often titled ""The Horse, the Hunter, and the Stag""). It highlights the trade-off: is revenge worth the price of slavery? The story teaches that it is better to endure an injury (from the Stag) than to surrender one's power to a master (the Hunter).
*   **C:** This fits a different type of fable where a smaller creature outsmarts a larger one; it doesn't fit the themes of vengeance or loss of freedom.
*   **D:** This focuses on the fleeting nature of pleasure, but the story is specifically about the permanence of the Horse's servitude.
*   **E:** This is a strong potential answer, but it is slightly less precise than ""B"" because it misses the context of the ""injury"" (the quarrel with the Stag) that initiated the disaster.

The most traditional and accurate moral for this fable is that seeking revenge through the power of a superior party often leads to a loss of freedom that is far worse than the original grievance.

1.  **The Conflict:** The cat wants the eel that the stork is carrying. However, the cat cannot get it unless the stork opens her beak.
2.  **The First Tactic (Flattery):** The cat tries to trick the stork into opening her mouth by complimenting her beauty and asking a question that requires an answer (""Could it be that your beak is just as red on the inside?"").
3.  **The Stork's Reaction:** The stork recognizes the trap. She stays focused on her prize (the eel) and refuses to be distracted or tricked into speaking.
4.  **The Second Tactic (Insults):** When flattery fails, the cat turns to insults and ""sour grapes"" logic, calling the stork ""filthy"" and ""wretched"" to provoke a defensive response.
5.  **The Conclusion:** The stork ignores the insults just as she ignored the flattery. She keeps her mouth shut and successfully keeps her meal.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Stay focused on your goals:** This is the most accurate description of the stork's behavior. Despite both flattery and verbal abuse, she remained focused on keeping her eel.
*   **B) Do not fear death:** Irrelevant to the story.
*   **C & E) Beauty/Flattery masks intentions:** While true of the *cat's* behavior, the story concludes with the stork's success in ignoring the distractions. 
*   **D) Don't be seduced by cunning words:** This is a common moral for stories like *The Fox and the Crow*, but the cat also uses insults here. The overarching theme is the stork's refusal to be diverted from her goal.

In many collections of fables (specifically those derived from Syntipas or similar traditions), this specific story highlights the wisdom of the stork in staying silent and focused on her prize despite the provocations of the cat.

'At the moment I am thi",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Opportunity:** The wolf has the dog in a vulnerable position (""sleeping in front of the barn"") and has the immediate opportunity to eat him.
2.  **The Deception:** The dog uses a clever argument—that he will be ""fattened up"" later—to convince the wolf to delay his meal.
3.  **The Mistake:** The wolf acts against his own interest by passing up a certain meal for the hope of a better one in the future.
4.  **The Lesson:** When the wolf returns, the dog is in a safe place (the roof) and reveals that he has no intention of keeping the ""agreement."" The dog's final remark (""don't wait for a wedding!"") highlights that the wolf should have acted when he had the chance.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Take what you can get when you can get it:** This directly aligns with the wolf's mistake. He had a meal and let it go. This is a classic Aesop lesson: a certain small benefit is better than a risky large one.
*   **B) Liberty:** The story is about survival and wit, not political or personal liberty.
*   **C) Cunning prey on gullible:** While true, the primary ""moral"" in Fables of this type usually focuses on the mistake of the predator/protagonist.
*   **D) Predatory nature:** This is slightly confused; the dog isn't the ""predatory nature"" here, the wolf is.
*   **E) Delay the inevitable:** The dog successfully avoided being eaten entirely, so it wasn't inevitable.

The core lesson is that one should not pass up a certain opportunity based on a future promise that may never be fulfilled.

When he finally decided to disembark, he said, 'I will let myself down now as fast as I can so as not to burden",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of this story, let’s look at the interaction between the gnat and the camel step by step:

1.  **The Gnat’s Perspective:** The gnat believes his presence is a significant burden to the camel. He feels he is ""weighing down"" the animal and that his departure is a considerate act that will provide relief. This shows the gnat has an inflated sense of his own importance and impact.
2.  **The Camel’s Perspective:** The camel is completely indifferent. He didn’t feel the gnat arrive, and he won’t feel him leave. To the camel, the gnat is inconsequential.
3.  **The Core Lesson:** The fable highlights the gap between how someone perceives their own importance (the gnat) and how others actually perceive them (the camel). The gnat thinks he is of great consequence, but to his neighbor, he is nothing.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the discrepancy between self-importance and the reality of one's influence on others.
*   **B:** While the gnat is arrogant, ""influence"" is a broad term, and the story focuses more on self-perception vs. neighbor perception.
*   **C:** The story isn't primarily about the camel’s ""patience.""
*   **D:** The camel is not being ""made wise"" by ""misfortunes""; there is no misfortune involved.
*   **E:** This is a literal description of the events, but it lacks the critical element of the gnat's vanity/self-importance, which is the ""moral"" point of the dialogue.

The most traditional and accurate moral for this Aesop-style fable is that people often think they are much more important than they actually are to those around them.

The fox turned to the women and said, 'What shouts there would be aga",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the fox and the women:

1.  **The Situation**: The fox observes women eating their own chickens in peace.
2.  **The Fox's Grievance**: The fox complains about a perceived double standard. He points out that if he were to eat those same chickens, he would be hunted, shouted at, and chased by dogs. He views his potential action (eating the chicken) as identical to the women's action.
3.  **The Old Woman's Rebuttal**: The woman points out the crucial distinction—**ownership**. The women are consuming their own property (""things which are ours""), whereas the fox is a thief who takes ""things that belong to others.""
4.  **The Lesson**: The story highlights that rights and permissions are tied to ownership or legitimate authority. Just because someone is allowed to do something with their own property does not mean a stranger or an outsider has the same right to that property.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A** directly addresses the distinction between what is permitted to a person in their own home/with their own property versus what others are allowed to do to it.
- **B** is irrelevant as there is no friendship described.
- **C** and **E** focus on the ""silence"" mentioned in the text, but the silence is a secondary detail to the main conflict regarding theft versus ownership.
- **D** is a general proverb about malice that doesn't fit the specific logic of the old woman's argument.

The fox's error is thinking he is entitled to the same behavior (eating the chickens) without the same right of ownership. Therefore, option A is the most accurate moral.

Why are you trying to wound me with your teeth,",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the viper and the file:

1.  **The Characters:** A viper (a soft creature with teeth/venom used for biting prey) and a blacksmith's file (a hardened tool made of iron designed to wear down or ""gnaw through"" metal).
2.  **The Action:** The viper attempts to bite the file to consume it or damage it.
3.  **The Reaction:** The file points out the futility of the viper's attack. Because the file is harder and stronger than the viper's teeth—and because it is an inanimate, ""insensible"" object that actually destroys the very materials it touches—the viper is the only one at risk of getting hurt in the exchange.
4.  **The Lesson:** This fable warns against attacking someone (or something) that is invulnerable to your weapons or who is much stronger/harder than you are. By attacking something ""insensible"" (meaning something that cannot be felt, moved, or damaged by your efforts, or an entity indifferent to your malice), you only hurt yourself.

Comparing this to the options:
*   **A) It is useless attacking the insensible:** This matches the classic moral of Aesop's ""The Viper and the File."" It highlights the futility of trying to harm someone who is invulnerable to your specific type of attack.
*   **B), C), D), and E):** While these contain general wisdom, they do not specifically address the dynamic of a soft creature trying to bite a piece of iron.

As they were disputing, they passed a statue carv",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interaction between the Man and the Lion:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Man and the Lion are arguing about who is superior.
2.  **The Evidence:** The Man points to a statue as ""proof"" of human superiority because it shows a human defeating a lion.
3.  **The Counter-Argument:** The Lion points out that the statue is biased because it was created by a human. He suggests that if lions were the ones creating the art/history, the depiction would be reversed.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that ""truth"" or ""victory"" depicted in art and history often depends entirely on who is telling the story. A single perspective (the statue) does not represent the absolute truth, especially when that perspective is created by a party with a vested interest in looking superior.

This leads directly to the idea that a story or argument may seem convincing until you hear the opposing side or consider the source.

- **Choice A** (""One story is good, till another is told"") perfectly captures the essence of perspective and the bias of the narrator.
- Choice B is incorrect as the story isn't about physical bravery, but about the representation of it.

On his way to the assembly of the birds, the peaco",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s look at the sequence of events and the motivations of the characters:

1.  **The Character's Motivation:** The peacock is described as beautiful and gentle. However, he agrees to give away his feathers specifically in exchange for **praises** (""I will squawk your praises throughout the courts""). This reveals that his primary motivation is vanity—the desire to be admired and spoken well of by others.
2.  **The Process of Destruction:** Because the peacock values the ""praises"" of the other birds more than his own physical needs (protection/nourishment), he continues to give away his feathers to anyone who asks (the crow, the cuckoo, etc.).
3.  **The Consequence:** By prioritizing his social standing and reputation (vanity) over his survival and his responsibilities (nurturing his chicks), he is left ""plucked completely bare."" Without feathers, he cannot survive the winter and dies, leaving his chicks to fend for themselves.

While the other birds were opportunistic (C), the story focuses on the peacock's choices and his ultimate demise. The lesson focuses on how his obsession with being praised for his beauty led to his literal and metaphorical exposure and death.

**A) Vanity can lead to self-destruction.**

2.  **The Triumph:** The Gnat successfully defeats the Lion by exploiting the Lion’s inability to hit such a small target, causing the Lion to wound himself.

**Analysis of Options:**

*   **C) Pride can turn triumph into frustration:** While pride is involved, ""frustration"" is too mild a word for the Gnat’s total destruction (death).
*   **D) Boastful cunning often outwits its frustrated self:** This is confusingly phrased and doesn't quite capture the irony of being killed by a smaller foe after beating a larger one.
*   **E) True strength is not always visible:** This applies to the Gnat beating the Lion, but it fails to account for the second half of the story where the Gnat is defeated by a spider.

The traditional moral of this Aesop's fable (*The Gnat and the Lion*) is that the person who defeats great enemies should still be wary of small dangers, and that overconfidence or bragging after a victory often leads to an unexpected downfall. Option A is the most accurate summary of the Gnat's journey from a boastful victor to a victim of a minor threat.

morables_361,"Some fishermen had gone out fishing, and when they had struggled for a long time but had not managed to catch anything, they became very downcast and prepared to turn back. All of a sudden a tuna fish",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Effort:** The fishermen exert significant effort and skill to catch fish (""struggled for a long time""), but their skill yields no results.
2.  **The State of Mind:** They are ""downcast"" and ready to give up, acknowledging their failure to obtain what they worked for.
3.  **The Turning Point:** A tuna fish literally falls into their lap (leaps into the boat) not because of their fishing techniques, but because it was fleeing a predator. 
4.  **The Conclusion:** They achieve their goal (obtaining a fish) through a stroke of pure luck/chance rather than through their labor or expertise.

**Evaluation of options:**
- **A:** Directly reflects the narrative. Their ""skill"" failed, but ""luck"" provided the prize.
- **B:** Talks about size and reputation, which relates to a different Aesop fable (*The Fir Tree and the Bramble* or *The Reed and the Olive*).
- **C:** While they were sad and then happy, this is a description of the plot rather than a universal moral lesson.
- **D:** This is nonsensical/grammatically incorrect.
- **E:** Their perseverance didn't actually lead to the reward; the reward was an external accident that happened just as they were about to stop.

The most accurate moral, traditionally associated with this Aesop's fable (*The Fishermen and the Tunny*), is that chance often provides what hard work or art cannot.

Not withstanding all his prayers, instead of becoming richer, he got poorer. Out ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the protagonist's response:

1.  **The Belief**: The man believes the Idol is a deity capable of granting wealth through prayer. He spends a long time worshiping it with no results.
2.  **The Action**: Frustrated (impatient), he destroys the Idol. This act of violence inadvertently reveals the gold hidden inside.
3.  **The Shift in Perspective**: Upon finding the gold, the man immediately changes his view of the ""deity."" He labels it ""graceless"" and concludes that the Idol only responds to force rather than prayer. 

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A**: This captures the essence of the man's shift. While he previously treated the object as a holy deity, he immediately rationalizes his violent act as the ""correct"" way to handle the Idol once it becomes profitable. His logic adapts to justify the outcome.
*   **B**: This does not fit the narrative, as the man does not delight in the ""ugly"" (the broken idol) for its aesthetics, but for the money inside.
*   **C & D**: While ""impatience"" is mentioned in the text, the outcome is not ""graceless"" (it is very profitable) and the story isn't about the incompatibility of opposites.
*   **E**: While the man was bold/violent, the story's concluding quote is more about the man's cynical re-interpretation of his ""religious"" relationship with the Idol based on the material gain.

In many editions of Aesop's Fables, this specific story (The Man and the Wooden God) is used to illustrate how people's perceptions of the divine or their principles change based on their own success or failure. The man’s ""belief"" was transactional; when prayer failed and violence worked, he simply adjusted his ""belief"" to favor violence.

Then the little gnat said to the bull, 'It's enough for me that you have accepted my ch",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict**: A gnat (small and insignificant) challenges a bull (large and powerful) to a contest of strength.
2.  **The Interaction**: By accepting the challenge, the bull acknowledges the gnat as a potential rival. The gnat immediately claims victory not by fighting, but by the mere fact that the bull treated him as an equal worthy of a challenge.
3.  **The Result**: The gnat boasts to the crowd, and the bull is left looking foolish despite his actual strength. 
4.  **The Lesson (explicitly stated in the text)**: The narrator notes that if the bull had ignored the gnat as being ""beneath contempt"" (ignoring an unworthy opponent), the gnat would have had nothing to boast about. 

**Evaluating the options:**
- **A**: This aligns perfectly with the text. By engaging with the gnat, the bull lowered his status to that of the gnat, allowing the gnat to claim equality. 
- **B**: Irrelevant; there is no mention of children or education.
- **C**: While pride is involved, the specific lesson is more about the loss of status through poor judgment of rivals rather than a ""downfall"" in the tragic sense.
- **D**: Nonsensical in the context of this story.
- **E**: While the contest was futile, the specific nuance of the story is about the reputation and the status conferred upon the weaker party by the stronger party.

Option **A** most accurately captures the moral: a person of high standing or great ability only harms their own reputation by entertaining challenges from those far beneath them.

The owner began to question the dog, asking how he could be so ungra",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue between the owner and the dog:

1.  **The Conflict:** The owner claims to be kind because he never personally struck the dog or spoke harshly to it. He views himself as innocent of any mistreatment.
2.  **The Dog's Rebuttal:** The dog points out that while the owner didn't physically strike him, he ordered others to do so.
3.  **The Lesson:** The dog concludes that the owner is just as responsible for the actions he commands as if he had performed them himself. The ""agency"" of the servants does not absolve the master of the blame.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) What a person does through another is truly their own action:** This directly matches the dog's point that being beaten by the owner's order is the same as being beaten by the owner.
*   **B) There is danger lurking in the words of a wicked person:** While the owner is being dishonest with himself, the core of the story is about delegation of actions, not just ""wicked words.""
*   **C) Kindness is often unappreciated:** The story proves that the owner's ""kindness"" was an illusion; the dog had every reason to leave.
*   **D) Better to face a known danger...:** This is the moral for ""The Wolf and the Lamb"" or similar fables, but doesn't fit here.
*   **E) Distinctive traits can lead to unexpected reunions:** This is a plot point (the bob-tail leading to his return), but it is not the moral or the philosophical takeaway of the dialogue.

The story illustrates the principle of *Qui facit per alium facit per se* (He who acts through another does it himself).

Even when they saw one of",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the characters' reactions:

1.  **Isolation and Indifference:** When the butcher begins taking sheep, the others pretend not to see. They focus only on their immediate individual safety (""He keeps his hands off me... let him take whom he takes"").
2.  **Lack of Unity:** Because the sheep do not react to the loss of their peers, their numbers dwindle until their collective power is gone.
3.  **The Realization:** The final sheep realizes that their failure to act when they were ""all together"" led to their inevitable individual destruction. If they had banded together at the start, they could have defeated the butcher.

**Evaluating the options:**
- **A) If you don't speak out for others, there will be nobody left to speak out for you.** This mirrors the logical progression of the story. The sheep's refusal to protect one another leads to a situation where the last sheep is alone and defenseless. This is a classic expression of the sentiment found in ""First they came..."" by Martin Niemöller.
- **B)** This refers to a different fable (The Frogs Desiring a King).
- **C)** While truth is involved, the specific point is about collective action and mutual protection, not just abstract wisdom.
- **D)** There are no insults or compliments in this story.
- **E)** The sheep weren't trying to ""fit in"" with a mighty figure; they were ignoring a predator.

The core lesson is that by failing to stand up for the members of their group when it counted, they ensured their own demise.

1.  **The Event:** A hooligan commits a reckless act (striking Aesop).
2.  **The ""False"" Success:** Instead of punishing him, Aesop rewards him with a coin. This immediate reward validates the hooligan's bad behavior and makes him believe that such actions are profitable.
3.  **The Suggestion:** Aesop uses the boy's greed and newfound confidence to lead him toward a much more dangerous target (the wealthy/important man).
4.  **The Ruin:** Encouraged by his previous ""success,"" the boy repeats the act. However, the consequences of attacking a powerful person are severe, leading to his arrest and execution.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Success leads many astray to their ruin:** This fits perfectly. The initial ""success"" (getting a coin from Aesop) gave the boy the false confidence and incentive to try the same reckless act on someone who would not tolerate it, ultimately leading to his death.
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for:** The boy didn't really ""wish"" for something that backfired; he acted greedily based on a promise of reward.
*   **C) Clever minds outwit reckless wealth:** Aesop is clever, but the second victim isn't described as ""reckless wealth""—he is just a person of authority.
*   **D) Avoid reckless overindulgence in manipulative pursuits:** This is too wordy and doesn't quite capture the ""false validation"" aspect.
*   **E) Responding with grace can disarm hostility:** Aesop didn't respond with grace to disarm the boy; he responded with a trick to ensure the boy was punished by the law.

The core lesson is that a reward for a bad deed is a trap that leads to eventual destruction. In traditional collections of Aesop's fables (like those edited by Phaedrus), this story is used to illustrate how early success in wrongdoing emboldens a person toward a fatal mistake.

1.  **Winter's Perspective:** Winter prides himself on his power and control. He describes himself as a ""dictator or a despot"" who forces people to stay indoors, look at the ground, and ""tremble"" in fear. He equates authority with the ability to intimidate and restrict.
2.  **Spring's Perspective:** Spring highlights that her presence brings joy, freedom, and activity. People gather flowers, travel, and celebrate. She points out that while Winter might have power, it makes people ""glad to get rid"" of him.
3.  **The Contrast:** The story contrasts two types of influence: one based on fear and coercion (Winter) and one based on love, beauty, and appreciation (Spring). 
4.  **The Conclusion:** Spring concludes that being loved leads to being remembered fondly and welcomed, whereas being feared leads to being loathed.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) It is better to be loved than feared:** This directly aligns with the argument Spring makes. Winter's ""despotic"" power makes him unwanted, while Spring's ""pleasant"" nature makes her cherished.
*   **B) Use care to place your blame on the right person:** There is no theme of misplaced blame here.
*   **C) Power can be both beloved and despotic:** While true in a literal sense, the story specifically argues that the ""beloved"" path is superior/more desirable.
*   **D) Powerful talent is wasted...:** The story isn't about talent, but about character and how one treats others.
*   **E) Even the harshest seasons have their own beauty...:** The story actually portrays Winter quite negatively (as a tyrant) and doesn't focus on his ""beauty.""

The core lesson is that those who rule or influence through kindness and joy are more valued than those who rule through fear and intimidation.

Everyone wondered at this, since the new horse was neithe",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation:** A soldier owns an excellent horse (proven quality) but buys a new one that is objectively inferior (less beautiful, less useful).
2.  **The Action:** Despite the second horse's inferiority, the soldier lavishes more attention and care on it than on the first.
3.  **The Observation:** Observers are confused because the new horse hasn't earned this favor through merit or utility.
4.  **The Explanation:** The concluding remark, ""it's natural to be fond of the newest arrival,"" highlights a human tendency toward **novelty over quality**.
5.  **Synthesizing the Lesson:** The story critiques the way people often neglect established excellence in favor of something new, regardless of its actual worth. 

Evaluating the options:
*   A) Focuses on how pleasure fades over time. While related to novelty, it doesn't quite capture the soldier's choice to prioritize the inferior ""new"" over the superior ""old.""
*   B) Deals with contentment and disaster, which are not present in the text.
*   C) The story actually shows the soldier ignoring ""usefulness.""
*   D) Irrelevant to the story's themes.
*   **E) We value what is less worthy more than what truly deserves our care.** This directly addresses the contrast between the excellent horse (deserving) and the new, inferior horse (less worthy), and the soldier's misplaced priorities.

A Kite saw him and exclaimed: 'You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no bus",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** The seagull tries to eat something that is physically beyond its capacity (a fish too large for its gullet). This results in a fatal injury.
2.  **The Commentary:** A Kite (another bird) observes the dying seagull. Instead of offering sympathy, the Kite criticizes the seagull for steping outside of its ""natural"" domain. The Kite suggests that a bird of the air belongs in the air and should not be hunting in the sea.
3.  **The Traditional Context:** This is an Aesop's Fable. Historically, many of these fables were used to reinforce the idea that individuals should stick to their own nature, their own lane, or their own specialized business rather than meddling in affairs for which they are not suited.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Every man should be content to mind his own business.** This aligns with the Kite's critique that the seagull overstepped its natural boundaries (the air) to meddle in the sea.
*   **B) Learn from past misfortunes.** The seagull dies, so it cannot learn from this experience.
*   **C) Greed breeds misfortune...** While the seagull was arguably greedy, the primary focus of the Kite's dialogue is on the *nature* of the seagull's business (sea vs. air).
*   **D) How often do we supply our unfortunate enemies...** This moral usually applies to fables like ""The Eagle and the Arrow"" where a bird is shot with its own feathers.
*   **E) Patience is key...** There is no element of timing or waiting in this story.

In classical translations of this specific fable (often titled ""The Sea-Gull and the Kite""), the moral is consistently summarized as people being happiest when they stick to their own business or spheres of expertise.

They urged one another to approach the river, but no one dared to get too close bec",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of foxes is thirsty, but the river current is intimidatingly strong. They are all cautious.
2.  **The Action:** One fox decides to show off. Her motivation isn't specifically to drink, but to ""embarrass her fellow foxes"" and prove she is ""braver than the rest.""
3.  **The Consequence:** She leaps in and is immediately swept away by the current, losing control of the situation.
4.  **The Response:** When her companions call out to her, she realizes she is in trouble. Rather than admitted she failed or is in danger, she makes up a face-saving excuse (claiming she has a ""message to take to Miletus"").

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The fox's boasting and desire to mock others led her to take a foolish risk that resulted in her being swept away.
*   **B:** The story isn't about greed or profit; it's about vanity and bravado.
*   **C:** This is incorrect because the fox's boldness did not successfully quench anyone's thirst; it led to her being swept away.
*   **D:** While the fox was a ""bad neighbor"" in her mockery, the core of the fable focuses on her own boastful action leading to her downfall.
*   **E:** The story portrays the fox's ""courage"" as reckless vanity rather than a wise or necessary action.

The fable serves as a warning against those who put themselves in danger just to brag or belittle others, only to be caught in a disaster they cannot escape.

1.  **The Premise:** The lion tries to act justly and suppress his predatory nature, but his innate hunger eventually wins out. 
2.  **The ""Trap"":** He creates a ""lose-lose"" social situation. Those who tell the truth (your breath smells bad) are killed. Those who lie/flatter (your breath smells fine) are killed. This demonstrates that the specific answer provided by the victim doesn't actually matter; the predator's intent is what dictates the outcome.
3.  **The Monkey's Case:** The monkey uses extreme flattery (""smells like cinnamon"") to avoid the initial trap. The lion, momentarily ashamed but still hungry, simply changes his strategy to a different ""legal"" or ""medical"" justification to eat the monkey anyway. 
4.  **The Conclusion:** Regardless of whether the animals were honest (the truth-tellers), dishonest (the first group of liars), or excessively flattering (the monkey), the result was the same: they were eaten.

Let's evaluate the options:
*   **A** captures the cynical reality of the story: when dealing with a tyrant who has already decided to destroy you, the nature of your speech (truth vs. lies vs. silence/flattery) does not save you.
*   **B** is irrelevant to the text.
*   **C** is inaccurate because it was the *lion's* intentions that were ruthless, but the monkeys' flattery failed to save him rather than masking his own intentions.
*   **D** refers to the ""Ass in the Lion's skin"" type of fable, not this one.
*   **E** is a ""pro-social"" moral that contradicts the actual ending of the story, where the lion abandons integrity for appetite.

The story illustrates a grim reality often found in Aesopic fables regarding power: to a tyrant determined to find an excuse, no answer is the ""right"" answer.

The partridge immediately started squawking his usual song, sauntering through every room in the house un",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of this story, let’s look at the interaction between the partridge and the weasel:

1.  **The Context:** A new partridge is brought into a home and immediately begins to act as if he owns the place—making loud noise, walking through every room, and perching openly.
2.  **The Conflict:** The weasel, a long-term resident of the house, confronts the bird. The weasel points out that despite being born in the house and having lived there for a long time, she remains quiet and humble (""I keep quiet and sleep beside the hearth"").
3.  **The Lesson:** The weasel criticizes the partridge for his ""confident vanity"" and lack of humility. The partridge’s immediate, loud, and boastful behavior as a newcomer is seen as a sign of arrogance that invites trouble. While the weasel is ""tricky,"" the primary focus of the dialogue is on the partridge’s misplaced confidence and loud cackling upon just entering a new environment.

Fables of this nature (Aesopic or Phaedrus-style) often warn against the arrogance of newcomers or those who boast without having established their place. In this specific fable (often titled ""The Partridge and the Weasel""), the contrast is between the newcomer's noise and the veteran's silence. The partridge’s vanity and loud behavior expose him to the predator.

- **A** is plausible but focuses on ""customs"" rather than the character flaw of vanity.
- **D** accurately hits the theme: the partridge's ""confident vanity"" (acting as if he is superior/safe immediately) leads to him being targeted by the ""tricky"" weasel.

The moral centers on the danger of being overly loud and confident in a new or dangerous environment before one understands the stakes.

Stung by the sharp pain,",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation**: A fox is in trouble (falling) and reaches out for instinctive help from the nearest object—a bramble bush.
2.  **The Conflict**: The bush, by its very nature, has thorns. When the fox grabs it, the fox is injured.
3.  **The Dialogue**: The fox blames the bush for being cruel. The bush responds that the fox was ""out of [her] mind"" to expect anything else, because the bush’s fundamental nature is to ""grab"" (hook/sting) everything it touches.
4.  **The Lesson**: The fox made the mistake of seeking support from something that is inherently harmful or antagonistic. You cannot expect a creature or object to change its harmful nature just because you are in need of help.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) It is foolish to expect help from someone who is naturally unkind.** This matches the bush's explanation that the fox was foolish to expect a different result from something naturally thorny.
*   **B)** This refers to boasting, which is not present here.
*   **C)** This is a general statement about pain but doesn't capture the relational lesson.
*   **D)** This refers to a common theme in other Aesop fables (like The Fox and the Cat), but not this one.
*   **E)** This is a plausible lesson, but the core of the bush's retort is about the **nature** of the provider, not just the caution of the seeker. In the context of Aesop's fables, the emphasis is usually on the folly of misjudging the character of others.

The most traditional and accurate moral for this specific fable (often titled ""The Fox and the Bramble"") is that it is foolish to fly to people for help who are more accustomed to doing harm.

1.  **Analyze the characters:** A **charcoal burner** works with soot and black dust, which naturally stains everything it touches. A **fuller** (a cloth cleaner) works to make fabrics white and clean.
2.  **Analyze the conflict:** The charcoal burner suggests they live together. The fuller refuses because their professions are diametrically opposed; the byproduct of the charcoal burner's work would ruin the results of the fuller's work.
3.  **Identify the lesson:** The story illustrates that certain natures, interests, or lifestyles are so fundamentally different that they cannot coexist or function together. The fuller recognizes that combining their lives would result in disaster for his own livelihood.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Opposites are utterly incompatible.** This fits perfectly. The story demonstrates that those with conflicting natures or goals cannot successfully join forces.
*   **B) Appearances can be deceiving.** This is not relevant; the characters are exactly what they appear to be.
*   **C, D, and E)** While they touch on cleanup or communication, they do not capture the fundamental conflict of the fable, which is the inherent mismatch of the parties involved.

Historically, this Aesop's fable usually carries the moral: *""Like should associate with like,""* or *""Opposites are incompatible.""*

morables_446,"A robber had murdered someone along the road. When the bystanders began to chase him, he dropped the bloody corpse and ran away. Some travellers coming from the opposite direction asked the man how he",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the narrative elements step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A murderer attempts to hide his guilt by lying to travelers, claiming the blood on his hands came from a mulberry tree (implying the juice of the fruit).
2.  **The Slander:** In making this excuse, he effectively ""smears"" or blames the innocent tree for the physical evidence of his crime.
3.  **The Outcome:** The pursuers catch him, and he is executed on that very tree.
4.  **The Dialogue:** The tree speaks at the end, explicitly stating its lack of pity because the man tried to frame it for a ""murder that you yourself committed.""
5.  **The Lesson:** The core irony is that an ""honest"" or inanimate entity (the tree) will not hesitate to see justice served to someone who tried to defame it or use it as a cover for their own wickedness.

Looking at the options:
- **A** captures the essence of the tree's dialogue: an ""honest"" entity (the tree) does not hesitate to participate in the punishment of one who slandered it. This is a classic Aesopic moral where nature or inanimate objects represent the ""honest"" party.
- **B** (equanimity) is irrelevant to the themes of guilt and justice.
- **C** (curiosity) doesn't fit, as it was the murderer's own lie and the pursuers' actions, not curiosity, that unmasked him.
- **D** refers to greed and honor, which are not present in this story.
- **E** (truth as a casualty) is a general observation but does not account for the specific ending where the ""slandered"" party assists in the punishment.

Option A is the traditional moral associated with this fable (Aesop Perry 170), emphasizing that those who try to blame their crimes on the innocent will find those they slandered turn against them in the end.

morables_430,Some field-mice were playing in the woods where a lion was sleeping when one of the mice accidentally ran over the lion. The lion woke up and immediately grabbed the wretched little mouse with his paw,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and character dynamics step by step:

1.  **The Act of Mercy:** The lion, a powerful and superior predator, chooses to spare the life of a tiny, ""wretched"" mouse. He views the mouse as too insignificant to bring him glory through its death.
2.  **The Reversal of Fortune:** Though powerful, the lion becomes helpless when caught in a hunter's trap. His strength is useless against the cords binding him.
3.  **The Repayment:** The mouse, remembering the lion's mercy, uses its unique ability (gnawing) to free the lion. A creature the lion once deemed ""tiny"" and insignificant becomes the only entity capable of saving him.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core of the story is about the reciprocity of kindness. Because the lion showed mercy to a small creature, that small creature was able to return the favor when the lion was in need.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The lion's ""small"" act of letting the mouse go resulted in his own life being saved later.
*   **B) Unequal matches bring misery:** Incorrect; the interaction between the unequal pair (lion and mouse) resulted in mutual benefit.
*   **C) Cleverness can free the trapped:** While true in a literal sense, it misses the thematic focus on mercy and gratitude.
*   **D) Those who act in their own innocent self-interest...:** Incorrect; the mouse acted out of genuine gratitude, not self-interest.
*   **E) Even the smallest actions can awaken great consequences:** While technically true, this is a very broad statement. The story specifically focuses on the cycle of kindness and help between friends of different sizes.

1.  **The Problem:** The Pigeons are afraid of the Kite (a threat).
2.  **The Solution:** They invite the Hawk (a predator) to protect them from the Kite.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Hawk kills more Pigeons in one day than the Kite would have killed in an entire year.

**Analysis:**
The Pigeons sought a ""remedy"" for their fear of the Kite. However, the Hawk proved to be a far more lethal and efficient predator than the original threat. The harm caused by the solution (the Hawk) far exceeded the harm threatened by the original problem (the Kite). This is the classic definition of a remedy being worse than the disease.

While **E** touches on choosing allies wisely, it focuses on ""intentions,"" whereas the fable specifically highlights the quantitative increase in destruction caused by the ""cure."" **A** is the traditional and most precise moral associated with this Aesop's fable.

At first, the Earth refused to cooperate in Herm",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Directive:** Zeus creates humans and intends for them to sustain themselves by farming (""digging in the ground"").
2.  **The Conflict:** Earth (Gaia) initially refuses to yield her resources to the humans.
3.  **The Resolution:** Earth is forced by divine command to comply, but she adds a condition.
4.  **The Consequence:** While humans are granted the ability to obtain food from the Earth, it is not given freely or easily; it is coupled with ""groans and tears,"" symbolizing the toil, suffering, and hardship inherent in labor.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Easy gains often come with hidden costs and hardships.** This fits the narrative perfectly. While the humans ""gain"" the ability to farm, it comes with the heavy price of physical exhaustion and sorrow.
*   **B) Do not fight with those who are perfectly capable of fighting back.** This is less relevant, as the humans aren't fighting Earth; they are merely taking what they need.
*   **C) Power can sway the reluctant.** While true (Hermes compels Earth), this describes a plot point rather than the ""moral"" or the lasting lesson regarding human existence.
*   **D) Powerful physical stature...** Irrelevant to the story.
*   **E) Guidance is the seed of self-sufficiency.** While Hermes provides guidance, the focus of the ending is on the suffering involved in that self-sufficiency, not the success of the guidance itself.

The story serves as an etiological myth explaining why human survival—specifically agriculture—is defined by back-breaking labor and hardship.

The butcher turned around and said to him, 'You haven't stolen my heart; indeed, I have taken heart from this lesson! So if you eve",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Event:** A dog steals a literal heart from a butcher. 
2.  **The Reaction:** The butcher is not merely angry; he is observant. He uses a play on words, noting that while he lost a physical organ (the heart), he gained ""heart"" (intellectual courage or a lesson) from the experience.
3.  **The Resolution:** The butcher declares that he is now prepared and will not let the theft happen again. He has gained wisdom from the event that will dictate his future behavior.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) Experience teaches valuable lessons and encourages caution:** This fits perfectly. The butcher explicitly states he has ""taken heart from this lesson"" and warns the dog that he is now prepared for a future encounter.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** This is often associated with fables like ""The Scorpion and the Frog,"" but it isn't the primary focus here.
*   **C) Boldness without caution leads astray:** While the dog was bold, the story focuses more on the butcher's reaction and his newfound vigilance.
*   **D) Better to face a bold danger...:** This is the moral for ""The Wolf and the Crane"" or similar tales regarding deceit.
*   **E) Desire can lead to actions that betray trust:** There was no established trust between a stray dog and a butcher.

The core of the story is the butcher's realization. He was caught off guard once, but the experience served as a teacher, making him more cautious and prepared for the future.

morables_498,"There was a bullock who had been turned loose in the fields without ever having borne the burden of the yoke. When he saw a hard-working bull who was pulling a plow, the bullock said to him, 'You poor",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Setup:** A young bullock mocks an older, hardworking bull for his difficult labor. The young bullock enjoys a life of leisure because he has never been yoked.
2.  **The Turn:** When the time for a religious sacrifice arrives, the hardworking bull is rewarded with rest (pasture), while the idle young bullock is chosen for slaughter precisely because he is ""unblemished"" by work. 
3.  **The Realization:** The older bull points out that the leisure the young bullock boasted about was actually the preparation for his early death. The ""burden"" the young bullock avoided resulted in his destruction, while the ""burden"" the old bull bore resulted in his continued life.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) He laughs best that laughs last:** This fits perfectly. The young bullock laughed at the old bull's plight, but the situation reversed completely. The old bull is the one left alive to have the final word.
*   **B) The great do not always prevail:** This doesn't apply, as the story is about work and sacrifice, not ""greatness"" or power struggles.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers youthful naivety:** While true in a general sense, the story focuses specifically on the reversal of fortunes and the danger of mocking someone's labor. 
*   **D) He that is neither...:** This is nonsensical in the context of this fable.
*   **E) One should not judge others...:** While a good lesson, it lacks the specific sting of the ""reversal"" present in the ending.

In most classical translations of Aesop's Fable ""The Bullock and the Ox,"" the moral is traditionally summarized as ""He who laughs last, laughs best"" (or ""Idleness leads to destruction""). The bullock’s initial mockery is proven foolish by the final outcome.

A man who was planning to make such a voyage had brought his monkey along with him,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events:

1.  **The Pretense:** The monkey is being saved by a dolphin who mistakes him for a human. To bolster his status, the monkey lies about his origins and his connections (claiming to be from an illustrious family).
2.  **The Mistake:** When asked about Piraeus (a harbor), the monkey assumes it is a person to continue his charade of being ""well-connected.""
3.  **The Consequence:** The dolphin realizes the monkey is a liar. Because the monkey pretended to be something he was not and lied about things he didn't know, the dolphin withdraws his help, leading to the monkey's death.

**Analysis of choices:**
*   **A) Those who pretend to be what they are not, sooner or later, find themselves in deep water.** This is a perfect fit. It uses a play on words (""deep water"") regarding the monkey's literal drowning and the figurative trouble caused by his deception and vanity.
*   **B)** There is no comparison between one man and a crowd in this story.
*   **C)** The plans in this story did not calm infuriation; the lie caused it.
*   **D)** While truthful, the phrasing is awkward and doesn't capture the essence of the monkey's specific failure (vanity/pretension).
*   **E)** The companionship in this story failed specifically because of the monkey's character flaws.

The story serves as a warning against boasting and lying to impress others, as these falsehoods are eventually exposed.

Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Threat:** The Cat enters the house and begins eating the Mice.
2.  **The Response:** The Mice experience the Cat’s lethal nature firsthand and go into hiding (they are ""deceived"" by the Cat's initial presence into thinking the house was safe, or rather, they have learned from the direct experience of being hunted).
3.  **The Trick:** The Cat attempts to deceive them again by pretending to be dead (hanging from a peg).
4.  **The Lesson:** One Mouse recognizes the trick. Because they have already seen what the Cat is capable of, they refuse to trust her, even when she appears harmless or transforms into something else (like a meal-bag).

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) He who is once deceived is doubly cautious:** This fits perfectly. The Mice have learned from their previous dangerous encounters with the Cat. Even when the Cat tries a new, clever disguise, their past experience has made them extremely wary and impossible to fool. 
*   **B) Powerful and deceitful collaborate:** There is no collaboration here; it is a predator-prey relationship.
*   **C) Caution tempers cunning:** While true that caution overcomes the Cat's cunning, this is a less common phrasing for the specific lesson of learning from past danger.
*   **D) Cunning subordinates:** There are no subordinates in this story.
*   **E) Unchecked problems:** This describes the situation (Mice in a house) but is not the lesson learned by the characters.

The fable (often attributed to Aesop as ""The Cat and the Mice"") traditionally concludes that those who have been tricked or endangered once will not be easily fooled again.

Just as he was about to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and wak",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the dialogue and the plot:

1.  **The Situation:** A traveler chooses to sleep on the edge of a deep well—a dangerous and foolish location.
2.  **The Intervention:** Dame Fortune (the personification of luck/fate) wakes him up.
3.  **The Message:** She explicitly states that if he had fallen in, people would have blamed ""bad luck"" (her) for the accident, even though the accident would have been the result of the traveler's own ""folly"" and poor decision-making. 
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that humans often blame fate or luck for misfortunes that are actually caused by their own lack of judgment or personal responsibility. It suggests that individuals have control over their outcomes through their choices.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Everyone is more or less master of his own fate:** This aligns perfectly with the text. Dame Fortune argues that the traveler is responsible for his own safety and that his ""calamities"" are self-inflicted rather than destined.
*   **B) Every tale is not to be believed:** This is unrelated to the context of the well or Fortune's speech.
*   **C) Guard your energy wisely:** While the traveler was weary, the story focuses on *where* he slept and the *blame* associated with the outcome, not his energy management.
*   **D) He who incites to concerned strife...:** This is the moral for a different fable (usually ""The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner"").
*   **E) Exhaustion can lead to perilous oversight:** While true in the story, it is a literal observation rather than the broader philosophical moral intended by Dame Fortune’s monologue regarding blame and fate.

The traditional moral associated with this Aesop’s fable (often titled ""The Boy and Fortune"" or ""The Traveler and Fortune"") is that we should not blame luck for our own faults.

The man took the handle and fitted it to his axe. The",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Request:** A man (the potential antagonist to the trees) asks his future victims for the tool necessary to harm them (a handle for his axe).
2.  **The Cooperation:** The trees, thinking they are being helpful or perhaps sacrificing a small part of themselves, provide the man with exactly what he needs to destroy them.
3.  **The Result:** Armed with the gift provided by the trees, the man immediately uses it to cut them down.
4.  **The Realization:** The oak tree recognizes that their own actions (giving the enemy the means to destroy them) led directly to their downfall.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) You should think twice before offering anything to your enemies:** This fits perfectly. The trees enabled their enemy to destroy them by providing the necessary resource.
*   **B)** This focuses on ""injury with impunity,"" which doesn't quite match the voluntary nature of the initial gift.
*   **C) Generosity without wisdom invites regret:** This is a strong contender, as the trees were ""generous"" with their wood but unwise regarding the consequences. However, the core of the specific fable (traditionally known as ""The Woodman and the Trees"") focuses on **aiding an adversary**.
*   **D)** This suggests the trees were forced, but the story says they ""selected"" the wood, implying a choice.
*   **E)** This is irrelevant to the plot.

In the tradition of Aesop's fables, this story warns that those who provide their enemies with the means to harm them are responsible for their own ruin. While C is a good general lesson, **A** most accurately captures the dynamic between the trees and the man (the enemy).

The crab said to her, 'O mother, lead the way, and I will try to walk accordingly.",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the interaction between the characters:

1.  **The Interaction:** The mother crab criticizes her son for walking ""crookedly"" and instructs him to walk straight (a precept/instruction).
2.  **The Challenge:** The son asks his mother to demonstrate the behavior she is demanding (a request for an example).
3.  **The Outcome:** The mother is unable to perform the action herself because it is contrary to her nature.
4.  **The Lesson:** One cannot effectively teach or command others to do something that they themselves cannot or do not do. Instruction is meaningless if the teacher cannot provide a practical example.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) Example is more powerful than precept:** This aligns perfectly with the story. A ""precept"" is a rule or instruction. The mother gave a precept, but failed to provide the example, rendering her instruction useless.
*   **B) Contentment with our lot...:** This story is about behavior and instruction, not satisfaction with one's status.
*   **C) Those who cannot see the path...:** While the mother is guiding him poorly, the core of the story is about the hypocrisy of her demands relative to her own actions.
*   **D) Hypocritical equals...:** The characters are mother and son (not necessarily ""equals""), and the focus is on the power of example rather than the nature of friendship.
*   **E) Even the crooked can find their way...:** This contradicts the ending, where the mother fails to lead and the son remains unchanged.

The fable teaches that you should not criticize others for a fault you possess yourself, and that leading by example is the only effective way to teach.

1.  **The Wolf:** He is a thief who has hoarded ""booty"" (stolen goods). He is also spiteful and paranoid, which causes him to insult the fox.
2.  **The Fox:** She is a deceiver who attempts to manipulate the wolf. When insulted, she betrays the wolf to the shepherd.
3.  **The Outcome:** The wolf (a thief) is killed due to the fox's betrayal. The fox (a deceiver and a traitor) is ultimately caught and killed as well, recognizing her death as justice for her ""serious crime"" of bringing about the wolf's death.

**Evaluation of the options:**
*   **B, C, D, and E:** While these touch on elements of the story (deceit, spite, isolation), they do not capture the overarching narrative arc involving the destruction of both characters.
*   **A: Take pleasure when thieves destroy themselves.** This is a classic interpretation of this specific Aesopic fable (often titled ""The Wolf and the Fox""). The story demonstrates a ""villain vs. villain"" scenario. Both the wolf and the fox are predatory, dishonest actors. When their internal conflict leads to their mutual destruction, the ""moral"" observed by the narrator or audience is that it is a positive outcome for the world when such characters eliminate each other. The shepherd benefits from the wolf's death, and the fox's eventual death at the hands of hunters brings her treacherous journey to an end.

The fox's final realization—that she is dying because she caused another's death—underscores the idea that those who live by deceit and theft will eventually be consumed by those same forces.

1.  **The Intervention:** An Eagle is in a life-and-death struggle with a Serpent. A countryman (man) intervenes to save the Eagle. This is an act of kindness/assistance.
2.  **The Revenge:** The Serpent, angry at the man, poisons the man's water.
3.  **The Reciprocation:** Just as the man is about to drink the poison, the Eagle (remembering the man's help) knocks the horn away, saving the man's life.

The story highlights a cycle of gratitude. The man helped the Eagle, and in return, the Eagle helped the man. This perfectly illustrates the classic proverb that ""one good turn deserves another,"" meaning that a favor or a kind deed should be repaid with another.

His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, My master gives a feast, a",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events:

1.  **The Situation:** A ""stranger Dog"" is invited by a friend to sneak into a feast. He does not have a legitimate invitation from the host (the Rich Man); he is an interloper entering through an unofficial channel (the ""back stairs,"" metaphorically speaking).
2.  **The Action:** While the dog is inside, reveling in the prospect of food he hasn't earned or been formally invited to share, he is caught by the Cook.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he has no right to be there, he is treated roughly and thrown out of the window.
4.  **The Aftermath:** The dog lies about his experience to save face, but the core lesson lies in his unceremonious ejection. 

**Analysis of Choices:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. Entering by the ""back stairs"" refers to seeking benefits through illegitimate or unofficial means. Being ""shown out at the window"" describes the sudden, harsh rejection one faces when caught where they don't belong.
*   **B:** There were no ""enemies"" making promises in this story; it was a friend's invitation.
*   **C:** This is too vague and doesn't address the consequence of the dog's intrusion.
*   **D:** There was no ""deceitful promise of safety"" from a danger; it was an invitation to a feast.
*   **E:** The story actually shows that generosity (the Rich Man's feast) has *limits*—the Cook serves as the enforcer of those boundaries.

The fable teaches that if you sneak into a place where you have no official standing or invitation, you should expect to be treated with contempt and expelled.

morables_707,"There was a certain miserly man who was dying and about to part with his enormous heap of money, ill-gotten as it was. He ordered that the bag of coins be brought to him as he was dying and then asked",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the key elements of the fable:
1.  **The Character:** A ""miserly man"" with ""ill-gotten"" wealth who has ""sweated"" over his coins.
2.  **The Situation:** He is dying and realizes he cannot take his wealth with him.
3.  **The Result:** The money speaks, revealing that his hard work was in vain—his heirs will squander it on vice, and he will face eternal torment for how he acquired/hoarded it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) A life of greed and hoarding wealth leads to misery:** This is a strong candidate, as it captures the futility of the miser's life.
*   **B)** This is irrelevant to the text (often the moral of ""The Frogs Desiring a King"").
*   **C) Ill-gotten gains bring eternal torment:** This is a very specific and direct reflection of the bag's final statement regarding the demons and the ""ill-gotten"" nature of the coins.
*   **D)** This is irrelevant to the text (often the moral of ""The Fox and the Lion"").
*   **E) The fruits of toil may not always yield the intended legacy:** This is also true, as the miser intended to keep his money or have it matter, but it will be squandered.

Between A, C, and E, **C** is the most precise moral derived from the specific dialogue in the fable. The bag explicitly links the ""ill-gotten"" nature and the ""sweat"" of hoarding to ""eternal torments"" and the wastefulness of heirs. Traditionally, in Aesopic and medieval fables of this nature, the focus is on the spiritual and practical ruin caused by ""ill-gotten"" wealth. 

However, looking at the overarching theme of a miser facing the end of his life, **A** is the broadest and most common moral definition for this type of story. Given the choices provided, **C** directly addresses the ""ill-gotten"" descriptor and the specific ""torment"" mentioned in the text.

The city mouse finished his business in the country and by means of insistent inv,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the plot and the concluding dialogue:

1.  **The Contrast:** The story sets up a contrast between the ""humble meal of acorns"" in the country and the ""overflowing food"" and ""delicacies"" of the city.
2.  **The Conflict:** While the city mouse enjoys luxury, he lives in constant danger and fear (represented by the butler). The city mouse is accustomed to this stress (the ""familiar mouse hole""), but the country mouse finds the terror unbearable.
3.  **The Resolution:** The country mouse decides that the high-quality food is not worth the fear and lack of security. He explicitly states, ""Acorns are enough for me... so long as I am secure in my freedom!"" 

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Directly reflects the country mouse's conclusion. He prefers his ""poverty"" (acorns) because it comes with peace of mind, whereas the city ""wealth"" (delicacies) comes with ""worries"" (terrible fright/danger).
*   **B:** While generally true, it is too broad and doesn't capture the specific trade-off between luxury and safety described in the text.
*   **C:** This describes a psychological observation within the story (the city mouse being used to the danger) but isn't the *lesson* or moral the story intends to convey.
*   **D:** This is a moral from a completely different fable (The Thief and the Hangman) and is irrelevant here.
*   **E:** This is a summary of the plot's inciting incident rather than a moral lesson.

The central lesson is that a simple, quiet life is preferable to a life of luxury accompanied by constant fear and danger.

The beetle then felt contem",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the character's journey:

1.  **The Inciting Incident:** A beetle, who is perfectly healthy and well-fed (""fully sated""), sees an eagle and becomes dissatisfied with his humble life.
2.  **The Conflict/Arrogance:** He begins to boast and put on airs, claiming his voice and appearance are just as good as the eagle's. He rejects his own kind and his home (""dung heap"") to join a ""higher"" society he is not physically equipped for.
3.  **The Failure:** He attempts to act like a bird (flying in high winds), but he lacks the strength and nature of an eagle. He fails miserably.
4.  **The Consequence:** He ends up ""far away from his home,"" exhausted and ""facing starvation."" He has lost his comfort and his high status in the dung heap because he tried to be something he wasn't.
5.  **The Resolution:** He realizes that his previous life was far better than his failed attempt at grandeur.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The beetle was arrogant, put on airs, failed to achieve the ""promotion"" to bird status, and lost his security (his dung heap/home).
*   **B:** There is no ""avenging"" or ""wrong"" done to the beetle; the eagle didn't harm him.
*   **C:** The story warns *against* trying to change one's nature to fit in elsewhere; it is not a positive celebration of diversity.
*   **D:** There is no physical combat or violence in the beetle's strategy; it's about his personal failure of ambition.
*   **E:** While the beetle had a moment of wonder, the fallout was negative, making this an incomplete or misleading moral.

The story warns that those who abandon their safe, natural position out of pride and a desire for unearned status often end up losing everything.

I can't decide what to do: my love of money and my innat",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the character's behavior and the central conflict.

1.  **The Conflict**: The protagonist is a ""greedy coward"" who discovers a treasure—a lion made of gold. His greed makes him want the gold, but his cowardice makes him afraid of its shape (a lion), even though a statue of a lion cannot harm him.
2.  **The Character's Reaction**: He experiences a psychological ""war,"" describing the gift as ""unwelcome"" and ""offering no satisfaction."" His inability to reconcile his fear with his desire prevents him from actually possessing or enjoying the wealth himself.
3.  **The Resolution**: He decides to send others to do the work while he watches from a safe distance, illustrating that his fear acts as a barrier between him and the reward.
4.  **Evaluating the Options**:
    *   **B, C, and E** touch on themes in the story but don't capture the primary irony of a man standing before a fortune he is too afraid to touch.
    *   **D** is a misinterpretation of the ending (he is not ""ruling"" or in ""peril""; he is simply failing to act personally).
    *   **A** directly addresses the core irony: The man has found immense wealth, but it is effectively useless to him because his character (cowardice) prevents him from seizing or enjoying it.

The story teaches that external fortune means nothing if the possessor lacks the spirit or courage to utilize it.

morables_615,"At one time, it seemed to all the beasts that they should hold a meeting and assembly, as there were frequent complaints among them about one another. When opinions were exchanged back and forth, the ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"In this fable, which is famously attributed to Aesop, the hares argue for a system of equality where strength and power are distributed evenly so that the weak are not preyed upon by the strong. The lions' response points out a practical reality: while the hares' ideals sound good in theory, the hares lack the physical power (claws and teeth) to enforce those ideals or to back up their demands against those who actually possess the power.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. **The Hares' Argument:** They seek equality and fairness to protect themselves from being prey.
2. **The Lions' Rebuttal:** They acknowledge the words are ""good"" but emphasize that the hares lack the natural weapons/power required to make such demands a reality or to defend their position.
3. **The Core Lesson:** Ideas of equality and rights are often ineffective if they are not backed by the power or means to defend them. In a world governed by force, those who demand change must be prepared to enforce or defend that change.

Comparing options:
- **A) Be prepared to defend your position:** This aligns with the lions' point that words without ""claws and teeth"" (the means to defend the position) are insufficient.
- **B, C, D, E:** These either contradict the cynical reality presented in the story or focus on modern ideals of dialogue and fairness that the fable actually critiques as being powerless without strength.

The moral is that fine words and arguments for equality mean little if you do not have the strength or means to support them.

There was a whole crowd of monkeys there and one of them ,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the actions and consequences for each character:

1.  **The Liar:** He recognizes that the monkey leader is vain and wants to be treated like an emperor. He uses flattery and falsehoods to appeal to the leader’s ego. As a result, he is rewarded with presents.
2.  **The Monkey Leader:** He is obsessed with status and ""thrives on deception"" (the fantasy that he is an emperor). He rewards those who feed this delusion.
3.  **The Truth-Teller:** He assumes that truth is objectively valued. However, by speaking the truth (""You are simply a monkey""), he insults the leader’s pride. 
4.  **The Reaction:** Instead of being rewarded for his honesty, the Truth-Teller is brutally attacked. This shows that in an environment built on vanity and lies, the truth is perceived as a threat or an insult, leading to retaliation.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Those who thrive on deception often retaliate against those who speak the truth.** This fits perfectly. The monkeys (thriving on the deception of being a royal court) punish the man for shattering their illusion.
*   **B) It is difficult to truly know a person.** This is irrelevant to the plot; the characters' natures are quite clear.
*   **C) Flattery deceives the naive.** While true, this focuses only on the monkeys' reaction to the liar, not the central irony of the truth-teller's punishment.
*   **D) Naive familiarity mollifies even the most terrifying things.** This does not reflect the aggressive ending of the story.
*   **E) In the land of deception, truth is its own defense.** This is the opposite of what happens; the truth actually leads to the man's injury.

The fable serves as a cynical warning that speaking the truth to the vain or powerful can be dangerous, especially when they prefer a flattering lie.

This slave-woman, bedecked with gold and trailing a delicate purple robe aro",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative elements:

1.  **The Premise:** A man is inexplicably obsessed with a slave-woman described as ""ugly"" and ""wicked,"" elevating her status above his own wife and showering her with gold.
2.  **The Irony:** The woman believes her success is due to her own beauty or the favor of Aphrodite (the goddess of beauty). She behaves arrogantly because she believes she is divinely blessed.
3.  **The Climax:** Aphrodite appears in a dream to correct this misconception. She clarifies that she did not make the woman beautiful.
4.  **The Resolution/Critique:** Aphrodite expresses disgust (""I am furious"") toward the man's perception. The goddess essentially states that there is no objective beauty in the woman; rather, the man is under a strange, irrational delusion that offends the goddess of beauty herself.

**Option Analysis:**
*   **A:** This aligns with the classical interpretation of the fable. If a man sees ""ugly"" as ""beautiful,"" it is treated in Greek fables as a sign of insanity or a divine curse, as it defies the natural order and the standards of the gods.
*   **B:** There is no mention of a conscience or guilt in the story.
*   **C:** Generosity is portrayed as misplaced here, not as a redeeming quality.
*   **D:** The ""lot"" of the characters is depicted as messy and offensive to the gods, not something to be content with.
*   **E:** The story explicitly mocks the woman's character (""wicked""), and Aphrodite confirms she is neither internally nor externally beautiful.

In traditional Aesopic collections (where this fable originates), the moral is that when people of no merit achieve great status through someone else's irrationality, it is an affront to reason and the gods.

morables_134,A father had an unmanageable son who indulged his vicious adolescent temper by brutally whipping the slaves whenever his father wasn't looking. Aesop therefore shared this little story with the father,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative and the advice given:

1.  **The Context:** A father has a son with a violent, unrestrained temper who hurts others (the slaves) when unsupervised.
2.  **The Fable:** A farmer yokes a wise, older bull with a reckless, young bull. The purpose is not to increase the workload, but to use the older bull's presence and stability to ""check"" or restrain the young bull's violent kicking and butting.
3.  **The Application:** Aesop tells the father to keep the boy by his side so that his own ""moderation"" (calmness and wisdom) can restrain the boy's ""reckless inclinations.""
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A:** While the father's moderation is meant to stop the behavior, ""a mild disposition"" is a bit narrow compared to the broader lesson of guidance.
    *   **B:** Irrelevant; the story is not about mocking the elderly.
    *   **C:** This fits perfectly. The ""old bull""/father represents wisdom and moderation, which is used to ""temper"" (restrain or soothe) the ""reckless aggression"" of the young bull/son.
    *   **D:** This is the moral of *The Tortoise and the Hare*, not this story.
    *   **E:** This is a warning mentioned at the end, but the central *lesson* or *method* advised is the tempering of the youth through the presence of the wise elder.

While A and C are similar, **C** better captures the dynamic of the ""yoking"" metaphor—using strength of character and experience (wisdom) to control uncontrolled energy (reckless aggression).

All the other passengers started to swim, but the Athenian kept praying to Athena, maki",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of this fable (often attributed to Aesop and titled ""The Shipwrecked Athenian""), let’s look at the behavior of the characters:

1.  **The Context:** A ship has capsized during a storm, placing all passengers in immediate mortal danger.
2.  **The Athenian's Actions:** He relies entirely on divine intervention, praying and making promises to Goddess Athena instead of physically trying to save himself.
3.  **The Fellow Passenger's Advice:** He tells the Athenian that while it is fine to pray, he must also ""move his arms"" (swim).
4.  **The Lesson:** The story implies that divine help or outside assistance is not a substitute for personal exertion. One must take action to save oneself rather than waiting passively for a miracle. This is the origin of the famous proverb: ""Athena helps those who help themselves.""

Analyzing the options:
*   **A) Self-effort is essential:** This directly matches the lesson that one must ""move their arms"" to survive.
*   **B)** This refers to education/internal knowledge, which is not the focus here.
*   **C)** While practical, ""self-effort"" is a more precise description of the specific ""arm-moving"" metaphor.
*   **D)** This is philosophical jargon unrelated to the plot.
*   **E)** While the tide literally turned, the story focuses on the necessity of action over the revelation of character traits like courage or honesty.

Therefore, the moral is that prayer or reliance on others must be accompanied by one's own labor.

1.  **The Conflict:** The Frog and the Mouse are so consumed by their rivalry and their desire for ""sovereignty"" over a small territory that they decide to engage in a deadly, formal combat.
2.  **The Fixation:** During the fight, their focus is entirely on each other. They are ""armed"" and ready to ""fight to the death.""
3.  **The Outcome:** Because they are preoccupied with their mutual destruction, they fail to notice an external threat. A Kite (a bird of prey) sees them as easy, distracted targets and captures both of them.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that when two parties are locked in a petty or bitter dispute, they become vulnerable to a third party who can easily step in and take everything (including their lives).

Looking at the options:
- **A) When fools fight others run away with the prize:** This is the traditional Aesopic moral for this specific fable. The ""fools"" (Frog/Mouse) are fighting over the ""prize"" (the marsh), but the Kite takes both the combatants themselves.
- **B, C, and D:** These capture elements of the story but are less precise than A. 
- **E) Rivalries can blind us to the greater dangers lurking nearby:** This is a very strong modern interpretation of the theme.

However, in the context of classical fables (specifically Aesop's ""The Frog and the Mouse""), the most recognized moral is that mutual destruction in a quarrel only benefits a common enemy or bystander. Option A accurately reflects the ""third-party beneficiary"" aspect of the Kite's intervention.

1.  **Analyze the Plot:** The story involves a mother who has lost a daughter. She hires professional mourners for the funeral. The surviving daughter notices that the strangers (the hired mourners) are crying much more intensely than the actual family members.
2.  **Analyze the Dialogue:** The daughter asks why the strangers care more than the kin. The mother explains that the family gains nothing from the act of crying (""never the better for crying""), whereas the strangers are specifically paid to perform that grief (""the strangers have money for it"").
3.  **Identify the Core Theme:** The story highlights the difference between genuine emotion and performative emotion. It specifically points out that the intensity of the strangers' outward grief is driven by financial compensation, not genuine loss.
4.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A) Professional mourners serve those who pay the most:** This aligns directly with the mother's explanation. The ""grief"" shown by the strangers is a service bought with money.
    *   **B) Often there is more good to be found in one man than in a crowd of people:** This is a general moral from other fables but doesn't fit the specific context of paid versus genuine grief.
    *   **C) Curiosity thrives on observation:** While the daughter is curious, this is a minor plot point, not the central lesson.
    *   **D) Pragmatic temptation can lead... to compromise integrity:** This is too complex and philosophical for the cynical, straightforward point of the fable.
    *   **E) Grief can unite strangers in shared sorrow:** The story actually suggests the opposite—that the strangers' sorrow is fake and motivated by money, not shared emotion.

**Conclusion:** The fable (often attributed to Aesop) illustrates that outward displays of emotion can be purchased and that those paid to perform a role often do so more ostentatiously than those who are genuinely affected. Option A most accurately reflects this cynical observation about professional service.

2.  **The Conflict:** The traveler asks why she has abandoned human society for the wilderness.
3.  **The Resolution/Explanation:** Truth explains that in the past, lies were rare (found only among a few), but now they have permeated ""all of human society.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story suggests that Truth can no longer survive or be found in human civilization because falsehood and deceit have become universal among men.

As the ox stru",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A donkey and an ox are tasked with pulling a load together. The work is meant to be shared.
2.  **The Conflict:** The ox is injured but works hard, while the donkey refuses to help. Because the donkey refuses to share the burden, the ox is overstressed and dies.
3.  **The Consequence:** Once the ox dies, the donkey is forced to carry not only the original load but also the heavy carcass of the ox. This combined weight is too much for the donkey, leading to his collapse and death.
4.  **The Lesson:** The birds explicitly state that if the donkey had helped the ox, he would still be alive. By failing to support his ""neighbor"" or partner, the donkey inherited the neighbor's entire burden, which ultimately destroyed him.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This directly matches the narrative. By failing to help the ox, the donkey ended up bearing the ox's burden (literally and figuratively) and suffered for it.
*   **B:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't address the specific theme of cooperation/burden-sharing.
*   **C:** Hard work did not triumph in this story; both characters died.
*   **D:** While the burden continued, this is a literal observation rather than the moral lesson intended.
*   **E:** While the donkey avoided effort and suffered, the primary moral focuses on the reciprocal benefit of helping others to avoid taking on their failures as your own burden.

The most accurate moral is that helping others is often in one's own self-interest, as failing to do so may leave you with their share of the work and more.

1.  **The Origin:** The story begins by explaining that Man was created in a hurry, resulting in the omission of ""modesty.""
2.  **The Solution:** Jupiter cannot add it individually later, so he releases it to the ""multitude"" (humanity at large) as a general principle.
3.  **The Condition:** Modesty agrees to exist among humans on one specific condition: ""that carnal love might not be suffered to come into the same company.""
4.  **The Outcome:** Modesty explicitly states a law of her nature: ""for wherever that [carnal love] comes... I'm gone.""

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) Modesty and carnal love cannot survive together.** This directly reflects the final sentence of the fable, where Modesty declares she will depart whenever carnal love arrives.
*   **B) We must not require what is unreasonable.** This is a common moral in other fables, but not highlighted here.
*   **C) Haste can lead to unwelcome outcomes.** While the story mentions Jupiter was in a hurry, the focus of the fable is on the resulting relationship between two specific traits, not a warning against haste itself.
*   **D) Do not unmodestly mock...** This is irrelevant to the text provided.
*   **E) Virtues shared are virtues gained.** This does not reflect the conditional and exclusive nature of Modesty described in the text.

The fox then said to ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Context:** A fox and a monkey are traveling through a cemetery.
2.  **The Action:** The monkey makes a grand claim, asserting that the dead people buried there were once the freedmen (former slaves) of his ancestors. This is an obvious lie intended to make himself seem important and high-born.
3.  **The Reaction:** The fox observes that the monkey chose this specific location to tell his lie because the subjects of the story—the dead people—are physically incapable of contradicting him.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that people who wish to deceive others often choose circumstances where their claims cannot be verified or challenged by those involved.

Looking at the options:
*   **A)** Aligns perfectly with the fox's observation. The monkey exploits the ""silence"" of the dead to tell a lie that cannot be refuted.
*   **B)** Irrelevant to the story's events.
*   **C)** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific nuance of using the ""unresponsive"" nature of the cemetery to lie.
*   **D)** The monkey does not find himself in ""deep water"" (trouble) in this specific fable; he is simply mocked.
*   **E)** Too vague and doesn't address the deception regarding the ancestors.

Therefore, the story teaches that boasters and deceivers often pick the safest possible environment—one where no one can speak up to prove them wrong—to tell their tallest tales.

The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural i",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Character's Action:** A Farmer shows compassion and kindness to a creature in distress (a frozen Snake). He goes above and beyond by placing it in his bosom to provide warmth.
2.  **The Recipient's Reaction:** Once the Snake is revived, it does not show gratitude. Instead, it follows its ""natural instincts"" and bites the person who saved its life.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Farmer dies from the wound, realizing too late that his kindness was misplaced on a ""scoundrel"" or a creature whose nature is inherently harmful.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that performing a great act of kindness for a wicked or ungrateful person will not change their nature or prevent them from causing harm.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful:** This accurately reflects the story. Despite the Farmer's life-saving kindness, the Snake (the ungrateful party) was not ""bound"" or deterred from its harmful nature.
*   **B) The man who treats others well is rewarded by gratitude:** This is the opposite of what happens in the story.
*   **C) Gratitude prevents regret:** The Farmer feels regret precisely because there was no gratitude.
*   **D) Injuries may be regretfully forgiven...:** This does not fit the context of the betrayal depicted.
*   **E) Even in the coldest times, a touch of compassion can revive what seems lost:** While true in a literal sense in the story, it ignores the central point of the betrayal and the Farmer's death, which is the actual focus of the ""moral.""

Therefore, the traditional moral of Aesop's fable ""The Farmer and the Viper"" is that kindness to the ill-natured is often met with betrayal.

When the blacksmiths were working, the dog would go to sleep, but when they sat down to a meal he would wake up and approach his masters in a f",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the behaviors described in the fable:

1.  **The Scenario**: The blacksmiths are performing loud, heavy work (clanging hammers). Despite the noise, the dog remains asleep, showing that he is unaffected by or indifferent to the hard work occurring around him.
2.  **The Shift**: The moment the blacksmiths begin to eat, the dog wakes up. The sound of chewing is much quieter than the sound of hammers, yet the dog is instantly alert.
3.  **The Blacksmiths' Question**: They point out the hypocrisy of his selective hearing—he ignores the ""heavy hammers"" (the work/effort) but responds to the ""slightest sound"" of food (the reward/benefit).

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A**: This matches the story perfectly. The dog is ""inattentive"" to the work (the concern of the masters) but ""quickly notices"" the food (his own benefit).
*   **B**: This refers to agency and delegation, which is not present here.
*   **C**: While the story highlights a lack of diligence, the focus is more on the dog's selective attention toward his own gain rather than a praise of diligence itself.
*   **D**: This is the moral of ""The Wolf and the Lamb,"" referring to tyranny, which doesn't apply here.
*   **E**: This interprets the story as a lesson on acoustics or habituation rather than a moral character judgment.

The fable teaches that people (or animals) are often oblivious to the labor or concerns of others but become instantly alert when there is something to be gained for themselves.

morables_420,"One day the lion pretended to be sick and went limping up to the unicorn, his chief enemy. He greeted the unicorn and said to him, 'Let us put aside all that we have done in the past, because I am no ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the dialogue:

1.  **The Context:** The lion and the unicorn are established as ""chief enemies.""
2.  **The Catalyst:** The lion fakes an illness and uses a humble, supplicating tone to trick the unicorn into giving up his only defense (his horn).
3.  **The Consequence:** The unicorn, out of pity and trust, renders himself defenseless. The lion immediately attacks him.
4.  **The Dialogue:** The unicorn laments the lion's treachery, while the lion mocks the unicorn's ""folly"" for showing mercy to an enemy. The unicorn concludes by arguing that victory via guile is dishonorable.

While the unicorn argues for honor (Option E), the narrative structure of a fable usually serves as a cautionary tale to the reader. The primary error that led to the unicorn's downfall was trusting a lifelong enemy who appeared to be in a vulnerable position. The story warns that an enemy's nature does not change just because they appear weak or humble.

*   **Option A** directly addresses the trap the unicorn fell into: trusting an enemy who came to him ""humble and supplicating.""
*   **Option E** reflects the unicorn's final retort, but it does not encompass the preventative lesson of the fable (avoiding the loss of one's life/defense in the first place). In Aesopic traditions, the warning against misplaced trust in a predator is the standard moral.

Therefore, the most comprehensive lesson regarding the unicorn's fate is that one must never lower their guard or trust an enemy, regardless of the enemy's feigned distress.

But being the ruler of the freshwater wasn't enough for him; he wanted to rule the sea too. With t",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** The Pike is already the ""Prince of the River,"" possessing size, beauty, and strength. He has a high status in his natural environment.
2.  **The Conflict:** He becomes overly ambitious and seeks to rule a territory (the sea) that is beyond his natural domain and capacity.
3.  **The Resolution:** He is humbled and chased back to his river by a Dolphin, who is the natural superior in that environment. 
4.  **The Lesson:** The Pike realizes he belongs in the river and stays there. The story illustrates the danger of overreaching and failing to appreciate what one already has.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Be content with your lot:** This fits perfectly. The Pike was ""Prince"" of the river but risked everything because he wasn't content. Returning to his own territory and staying there signifies he learned to be content with his proper place.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you:** Not supported; the Dolphin's opinion isn't the focus, its strength is.
*   **C) Strength without humility invites downfall:** While true, the story specifically highlights geographic/situational boundaries (River vs. Sea).
*   **D) Ambitious counsel without mighty help is useless:** The Pike acted on his own ambition, not counsel from others. 
*   **E) True leadership is not just about appearance:** The Pike actually was strong and a ruler; the issue wasn't his leadership style, but his overextension.

The story serves as a classic warning against ""encroaching"" on others' domains and suggests that one should be satisfied with their own sphere of influence.

1.  **The Conflict:** Two soldiers are confronted by a robber. One stays to fight; the other flees immediately.
2.  **The Climax:** The soldier who stayed succeeds in defending himself and beats back the robber.
3.  **The Resolution:** The cowardly soldier returns after the danger has passed, making grand gestures with his sword and shouting bold threats to show how ""brave"" he is.
4.  **The Lesson:** The brave soldier rebukes him, pointing out that his words and show of force are meaningless because his actions (fleeing) already proved he lacks courage.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Courage in words means nothing if you flee in danger:** This directly addresses the contrast between the coward's boastful talk and his actual behavior during the crisis.
*   **B) There is little risk in being poor...:** This is irrelevant to the story.
*   **C) Bravery outshines cowardice:** While true, it is too general; the story specifically targets the hypocrisy of boasting after the fact.
*   **D) Know your aggressive, unreliable enemies:** The story is about a companion/friend, not an enemy.
*   **E) Courage in adversity reveals true character:** While this is a plausible theme, the dialogue focuses specifically on the emptiness of the coward's post-battle boasts.

The classic moral of this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Two Soldiers and the Robber"") is that a coward's boasting cannot deceive those who have seen him in action. Option A most accurately captures this specific irony.

1.  **The Situation**: The Eagle (the leader) gives the Hoopoe a seat of honor based on its ""crown"" and ""multicolored feathers"" (outward appearance/ornamentation).
2.  **The Conflict**: The other birds resent this because they know the Hoopoe’s actual habits—it spends its time ""rolling around in dung and filth"" (lack of inner virtue or cleanliness).
3.  **The Lesson**: The fable highlights the discrepancy between a fancy exterior and an unsavory character. It suggests that honor should be bestowed based on how one lives and behaves (character) rather than how one looks (appearance).

**Evaluating the choices:**
*   **A) True worth should be measured by character and deeds, not by outward appearances.** This directly addresses the contrast between the Hoopoe’s beautiful feathers and its filthy habits.
*   **B) It is very unwise... to provoke the least...** This is the moral of the fable ""The Eagle and the Beetle,"" but it does not fit this story.
*   **C) Resentment tarnishes celebration.** While resentment is mentioned, the focus is on *why* the resentment exists (the unfair distribution of honor).
*   **D) Notable kindness is never wasted.** This is the moral of ""The Lion and the Mouse"" and does not apply here.
*   **E) Inclusivity strengthens community bonds.** The story actually focuses on a failure of judgment within the community, not the benefits of inclusion.

The most accurate moral is that outward beauty can mask inner filth, and true merit should be based on nature and actions.

1.  **The Action:** A hen (a creature typically associated with nurturing/motherhood) finds snake eggs. Instead of leaving them or destroying them, she treats them as her own, providing the warmth and care needed for them to hatch.
2.  **The Nature of the Subject:** Snakes are natural predators of birds and harbingers of danger. By nurturing them, the hen is facilitating the birth of her own killers.
3.  **The Warning:** The swallow acts as the voice of wisdom, pointing out that the hen's ""kindness"" is ""senseless."" The swallow predicts that once the snakes hatch, their inherent nature will lead them to destroy the hen first, then others.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that performing acts of kindness or providing support to those who are inherently ""wicked"" or dangerous will not change their nature; it only empowers them to harm you.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Matches the story perfectly. The snakes appear ""innocuous"" as eggs, but their nature is wicked, and trusting/nurturing them leads to ruin.
*   **B:** This is the moral of ""The Dog and the Shadow"" or stories about greed, which does not apply here.
*   **C:** The story suggests the opposite; the hen's devotion *creates* danger.
*   **D:** This refers to the fable of ""The Frog and the Ox,"" which is about vanity and rivalry, not nurturing enemies.
*   **E:** While the hen crosses natural boundaries, the story frames this as an act of stupidity rather than a positive transcendence.

The fable is commonly known as ""The Hen and the Snake"" (one of Aesop's Fables), and its traditional moral is that a wicked nature cannot be changed by kindness.

1.  **The Situation:** A jackdaw is held captive by humans. While it is physically tied, its primary conflict is internal: it ""could not stand to live in human society.""
2.  **The Action:** The bird attempts to gain its freedom by flying back to its natural habitat (the nest).
3.  **The Consequence:** Because it is still tethered by the string from its captivity, it gets caught in the branches of its own home and dies. 
4.  **The Reflection:** In its final moments, the bird realizes that its desire to escape its ""condition"" (slavery) led to its demise because it was unable to survive the transition or handle the consequences of its flight.
5.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **B, C, and D** are irrelevant to the plot points of the story.
    *   **E** focuses on the human's perspective of the ""gift,"" but the story's climax and the bird's final monologue focus on the bird's state of mind and its reaction to its circumstances.
    *   **A** highlights that the bird’s ""unhappiness"" with its condition (slavery) drove it to a desperate act that caused its death. The fable illustrates that the bird's internal struggle with its situation—rather than the safety or lack thereof in the human home—dictated its tragic fate. This is a classic Aesop's moral: our internal reaction to our circumstances often determines our outcome more than the circumstances themselves.

'Be careful, my friends,' he said, 'what if we all drown before the me",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the narrative:

1.  **The Situation:** A ship is in a life-threatening storm.
2.  **The Action:** Most sailors are praying to saints (intermediaries).
3.  **The Critique:** One sailor points out that using messengers (saints) in an emergency is risky because the messenger might be too slow or the message might be lost before help arrives.
4.  **The Solution:** He suggests going directly to the source of power (God) to bypass delays or complications.
5.  **The Result:** They pray directly, and the storm calms.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) The shortest and surest way of doing things is best:** This aligns perfectly with the sailor's logic. He argues against the ""long"" route (intermediaries) in favor of the direct ""short"" route during a crisis.
*   **B) It is better to be loved than feared:** This is a Machiavellian theme unrelated to the story.
*   **C) Mercy tempers power:** While the storm calms, the focus of the fable is on the efficiency of the prayer, not the attributes of the deity.
*   **D) Not all pragmatic advice is diverse or wise:** The advice given *was* pragmatic and wise, so this contradicts the story.
*   **E) Urgency in communication is vital:** While communication was urgent, this focuses only on the ""why"" and not the ""how"" (the direct route vs. the indirect route).

The fable (traditionally attributed to Aesop or similar folklore traditions) illustrates that when time is of the essence or a task is important, dealing directly with the person in charge is more effective than going through subordinates.

The mice who lived in the house were always being hunted down by either the snake or the weasel, so when they saw the snake and the ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Conflict:** Two powerful predators (the snake and the weasel) are fighting.
2.  **The Miscalculation:** The mice (the weaker party) believe the conflict between the predators makes it safe for them to come out of hiding. They interpret the predators' distraction as an opportunity.
3.  **The Outcome:** The predators immediately set aside their differences to prey upon the mice, who were exposed and vulnerable.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) In conflicts between powerful parties, bystanders may suffer unintended consequences.** This is a strong fit. The mice are the bystanders who get caught in the literal ""crossfire"" (or rather, become the new target) when they intervene or expose themselves during a fight between superiors.
*   **B) Appearances can be deceiving.** While true (the mice thought it was safe), it is too broad.
*   **C) Timidity can outwit aggression.** The mice were not timid; they were bold, and they certainly did not outwit the predators.
*   **D) No one can be safe...** This is a variation of a different fable's moral (often associated with ""The Wild Boar and the Fox"").
*   **E) Conflict within can disrupt the peace of a home.** This focuses on the house rather than the lesson learned by the mice.

In Aesopic fables, this specific story (often titled ""The Snake, the Weasel, and the Mice"") traditionally serves as a warning that those who meddle in the quarrels of the powerful—or think themselves safe because their enemies are fighting—often end up becoming the victims once the combatants find a common interest.

'Well!' said the Boy, 'you'll regret it, because you'll never be as well cared for any",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the interaction between the Goldfinch and his Master.

1.  **The Situation:** The Goldfinch has escaped a cage where he was ""well cared for"" (provided with food, water, and shelter by a master).
2.  **The Master’s Argument:** The boy argues that the bird will regret leaving because he won't find the same level of comfort or ""wealth"" of resources elsewhere. 
3.  **The Bird’s Response:** The bird acknowledges that life might be harder or less comfortable, but he chooses self-reliance and autonomy over being a pampered prisoner. He explicitly values his ability to ""take care of myself"" (independence/liberty) over being ""under your care"" (captivity).

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) There is no wealth greater than liberty:** This directly addresses the trade-off presented. The bird trades material ""wealth"" (care/safety) for the intangible ""wealth"" of freedom.
*   **B)** This is irrelevant to the story's themes of freedom vs. security.
*   **C)** There is no indication that the boy's ""concern"" is masked by defiance; rather, the bird’s defiance is an open choice for freedom.
*   **D)** This is a variation of ""no matter where you go, there you are,"" which doesn't fit the bird's active choice to leave captivity.
*   **E) Freedom is a treasure worth pursuing, even at great risk:** While this is a common theme in fables, the specific logic of this fable emphasizes the **value** of liberty compared to material comfort (care), making A the more precise fit for the ""wealth"" of the cage vs. the ""poverty"" of the wild.

The core lesson is that independence and the ability to control one's own fate is more valuable than any material comfort provided by a master.

The mole said to them, 'Silence your complaining, since you can see that I am deprived of eyes.'",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions between the characters:

1.  **The Characters' Complaints:** The donkey and the monkey are focused on what they lack (horns and a tail). These are decorative or secondary physical traits.
2.  **The Mole's Intervention:** The mole interrupts them to point out a much more significant deprivation: the lack of sight (""deprived of eyes"").
3.  **The Lesson:** The mole is providing perspective. By showing the donkey and the monkey that there are others facing far greater misfortunes (blindness versus missing a tail or horns), he suggests that their own complaints are trivial. 

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Men would bear their misfortunes more patiently if they considered the ones of others:** This directly matches the mole's message. Perspective on the suffering of others makes one's own problems easier to bear.
*   **B) We must help one another...:** The story is about complaining and perspective, not the redistribution of burdens.
*   **C) Complaining won't restore what's lost:** While true in a general sense, the mole’s specific point is about comparing levels of misfortune.
*   **D) The complaining things... will happen to him in a deprived turn:** This describes a ""karma"" scenario not present in the text.
*   **E) Coveting what others have blinds us...:** The characters aren't necessarily coveting specific items from others, but rather bemoaning their own anatomical ""deficiencies."" The focus is on the scale of misfortune.

The most accurate moral is that our own problems seem smaller when we look at the greater hardships others face.

The soup fell out of the long bill of the Cra",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The Fox plays a trick on the Crane by serving food in a way that respects only the Fox's anatomy (a flat dish), knowing the Crane cannot eat from it. This is an act of unkindness and trickery.
2.  **The Crane's Reaction:** Instead of simply being a victim, the Crane returns the favor by serving the Fox in a vessel (a long-necked flagon) that only the Crane can use.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Fox experiences the same frustration she inflicted on the Crane. The text describes this as a ""fitting requital"" (a deserved retaliation).

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Do unto others what you would have them do unto you:** This is the ""Golden Rule."" The story illustrates the consequence of breaking this rule: if you treat others poorly, you should expect to be treated poorly in return. This fits the ""requital"" mentioned in the text perfectly.
*   **B) Beware the sort of person who uses tricks:** While a valid takeaway, it focuses on the victim's perspective rather than the overall lesson of reciprocity.
*   **C) Cleverness can outwit vexation:** This describes the Crane's action but doesn't capture the moral weight of the exchange.
*   **D) A clever alliance... is futile:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) Consideration for others' needs fosters true hospitality:** This is a positive restatement of the lesson, but the fable emphasizes the *retribution* for failing to do this, aligning more closely with the logic of Option A.

In Aesop's fables, this specific story is traditionally used to teach that those who set traps for others should expect to fall into them themselves, or more simply, to treat others as you wish to be treated.

Wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the persons in her father's house, he made some excuse to send her home o",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A man notices his wife is disliked by everyone in their household. He wants to see if this behavior is consistent elsewhere.
2.  **The Test:** He sends her to her father's house. 
3.  **The Result:** Upon her return, she complains that even the herdsmen and shepherds (who are out in the fields all day and barely interact with the household) looked at her with aversion.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The husband concludes that if people who only see her briefly at the start and end of the day dislike her, those who spend the entire day with her must find her even more intolerable.
5.  **The Lesson:** Small signs or interactions (the ""straws"") indicate a larger, more pervasive truth (the ""wind""). The reaction of the workers who barely saw her served as a clear indicator of how she behaved toward everyone else.

**Option A (""Straws show how the wind blows"")** is a classic proverb meaning that small signs indicate which way things are going or what the general situation is. In this case, the brief interactions with the shepherds were the ""straws"" that proved her character.

While ""E"" is a nice sentiment, it is not the lesson the husband draws from the experiment. The story is fundamentally about how small observations reveal a larger reality.

morables_693,"The coachman, hearing one of the wheels of his coach creak, was surprised; but more especially when he perceived that it was the worst wheel of the whole set, and which he thought had but little prete",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the fable step by step:

1.  **Understand the plot:** A coachman hears a wheel creaking. He is surprised because the wheel making the noise is the ""worst"" or weakest wheel of the set. He feels this wheel has the least right to complain (to ""take such a liberty"") because it is already the most faulty.
2.  **Identify the symbolism:** In fables, objects often represent human behaviors. A ""creaking wheel"" is a classic metaphor for someone complaining or making a fuss. 
3.  **Analyze the irony:** The story highlights that it is not the strong, hardworking wheels that are making noise; it is the one that is already failing or doing the least effective work.
4.  **Evaluate the options:**
    *   **A) Complaining is the privilege of the weak:** This aligns with the observation that the ""worst"" wheel is the one making the noise. In many versions of this Aesop-style fable, the moral is that those who do the least work or are the most deficient often complain the loudest.
    *   **B, C, D:** These do not relate to the specific interaction between the coachman and the noisy, faulty wheel.
    *   **E) Noise often masks vulnerability:** While plausible, the fable specifically focuses on the ""liberty"" or nerve of the weak to complain, rather than an intentional mask.

Historically, this fable (often titled ""The Creaking Wheels"") concludes with the moral that those who are the least useful or the most troubled are often the most vocal about their grievances. Among the choices provided, A is the most accurate representation of this sentiment.

morables_612,"There was a woman of Sybaris who broke a jar. The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, 'I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you'd gone right",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the fable step by step:

1.  **The Event:** A woman breaks a jar.
2.  **The Reaction:** Instead of fixing the damage or addressing the physical problem, the jar (personified) focuses on seeking legal justice or a ""witness"" to prove the woman's fault.
3.  **The Woman's Advice:** She points out the absurdity of the jar's priorities. She suggests that if the jar wanted to be ""wise,"" it should have sought a ""bandage"" (a practical fix for its wound/crack) rather than a ""court-case"" (a verbal/legal argument).
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that when a problem occurs, practical action to remedy the damage is far more valuable and useful than engaging in arguments, litigation, or blame-shifting.

Breaking down the options:
*   **A) Action is more valuable than arguments:** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between the ""bandage"" (action) and the ""court-case"" (argument).
*   **B) You can't please everybody:** The story is not about social pleasing; it is about problem-solving.
*   **C) Practicality triumphs over sarcasm:** While the woman is being sarcastic and practical, the moral is about the *choice* of action over words, not necessarily the triumph of one tone over another.
*   **D) Practical fortune...:** This is overly complex and does not fit the simple logic of the fable.
*   **E) Small actions...:** The story focuses on the utility of effort rather than hidden strengths.

The most accurate moral is that it is better to fix a problem than to argue about it.

morables_506,"The dolphins and Whales waged a fierce war with each other. When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative elements:

1.  **The Characters:** On one side, we have dolphins and whales—large, majestic, and powerful sea creatures. On the other side, we have a sprat—a tiny, insignificant fish.
2.  **The Conflict:** The dolphins and whales are engaged in a fierce, life-threatening war.
3.  **The Interaction:** The tiny sprat offers to mediate and settle the dispute between the giants. 
4.  **The Reaction:** The dolphin explicitly states they would rather face destruction through war than suffer the indignity of having an insignificant creature interfere in their business.

**Analysis:**
The core of the story isn't just about the war itself, but about the **pride** and **ego** of the combatants. The dolphin's response reveals that they value their status and the ""gran-deur"" of their conflict more than their own safety. They find it insulting that someone ""beneath"" them would attempt to settle their affairs. This pride leads them to continue a path of mutual destruction rather than accept a sensible solution from a humble source.

While several options touch on conflict, **Option C** (""Pride often leads to unnecessary conflict"") most accurately captures the reason the dolphins reject peace: their pride makes the intervention of the ""lesser"" fish unacceptable, thus sustaining an unnecessary and destructive war.

One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them. When th",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable ""The Man and the Satyr,"" let’s analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Actions:** The Man uses his breath for two seemingly contradictory purposes: first to warm his cold hands (blowing ""hot"") and then to cool his hot food (blowing ""cold"").
2.  **The Satyr’s Reaction:** The Satyr, a creature of nature, perceives this as a sign of duplicity or inconsistency. To the Satyr, a source that can produce two opposite effects from the same mechanism is inherently untrustworthy or ""double-tongued.""
3.  **The Symbolic Meaning:** Historically, this Aesop’s fable has been used to describe people who are inconsistent, hypocritical, or who shift their positions to suit their immediate needs. It warns against those who are ""double-faced"" or who ""blow hot and cold"" on an issue or a person.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the idea of ""blowing hot and cold"" as a metaphor for being double-tongued or untrustworthy.
*   **B:** Relates to greed or unforeseen consequences (e.g., King Midas), which is not present here.
*   **C:** While the man is technically being ""adaptable,"" the fable treats this as a character flaw (inconsistency/duplicity) rather than a virtue.
*   **D:** This is overly complex and does not reflect the Satyr's rejection of the man.
*   **E:** While action reveals the man's nature, the specific lesson is about the *contradiction* in his nature (the ""double breath"").

The moral of the story is that those who act with inconsistency or try to support opposing sides are not reliable friends.

1.  **The Context:** Socrates builds a very small house. A neighbor questions why a man of his stature and intellect would live in such a ""tiny"" space.
2.  **Socrates' Response:** ""If only I could fill it with true friends!""
3.  **The Implication:** Even a tiny house is difficult to fill because ""true friends"" are so rare. If Socrates, a wise and famous man, struggles to find enough genuine friends to occupy a small room, it suggests that true friendship is one of the rarest commodities in life.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) True friends are hard to find:** This aligns perfectly with Socrates' witty remark. He implies that even a small space is too large for the number of true friends one actually possesses.
*   **B) No curse weighs more heavily than a guilty conscience:** This is unrelated to the text.
*   **C) Curiosity fuels wisdom:** While the neighbor is curious, the story focuses on the rarity of friendship, not the acquisition of knowledge through questioning.
*   **D) Do not play the modest, philosophical wise man after the fact:** This refers to the narrator’s opening remarks about wanting Socrates' fame, but it doesn't reflect the core lesson of the interaction between Socrates and the neighbor.
*   **E) True greatness often requires enduring present hardships for future recognition:** This reflects the narrator's preamble about Socrates' death and fame, but it is not the ""moral"" of the specific anecdote regarding the house.

The fable (originally by Phaedrus) is a classic illustration of the rarity of genuine friendship.

morables_122,"The lion often found fault with the way he had been designed by Prometheus. Admittedly, Prometheus had made the lion very large and handsome, supplying him with sharp fangs in his jaw and arming him w",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative arc:

1.  **Preparation/Problem:** The lion, despite being the most powerful of animals, is deeply ashamed and miserable because of a specific, seemingly irrational fear (roosters). He is so despondent over this ""flaw"" that he considers ending his life.
2.  **Comparison/Turning Point:** The lion meets the elephant, an animal even larger and more physically imposing than himself. He discovers that the elephant lives in terror of an even smaller, more insignificant creature (a gnat).
3.  **Resolution:** Upon seeing the elephant's plight, the lion realizes that his own situation is actually superior. He finds perspective by comparing his burden to the burden of others. He concludes that if the mighty elephant can be undone by a tiny gnat, his fear of a rooster is relatively minor, and he regains his self-worth.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) There is always someone else worse off than you:** This fits the resolution perfectly. The lion realizes he is ""in much better shape than this elephant"" and chooses not to ""die of shame"" because he sees that even more powerful beings have greater vulnerabilities.
*   **B) No matter how you brag, you can be undone:** The lion wasn't bragging; he was lamenting his weakness.
*   **C) Strength alone does not guarantee invulnerability:** While true in the story, the *conclusion* drawn by the character focuses on the comfort found in comparing his lot to another’s, rather than a warning about vulnerability.
*   **D) You may share the labours... but not the spoil:** This is the moral for a different fable (The Lion's Share).
*   **E) Even divine gifts can spark envy:** The lion wasn't envious; he was self-critical.

The lesson is that perspective helps alleviate one's own suffering; seeing that others harbor similar or worse weaknesses makes our own burdens easier to bear.

morables_169,"The crow was making a sacrifice to Athena and invited a dog to the feast. The dog said to her, 'Why do you foolishly squander these sacrifices? The goddess clearly hates you so much that she has taken",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the crow and the dog:

1.  **The Context:** The crow is performing a religious sacrifice to Athena. In Greek mythology, the crow was once a favorite of Athena but was cast out or frowned upon (leading to the belief that the crow’s omens were unreliable or ""bad"").
2.  **The Conflict:** The dog points out the futility of the action. He argues that since the goddess already dislikes the crow and has stripped the crow of credibility, the sacrifice is a waste of resources (squandering).
3.  **The Resolution:** The crow explains her logic: the very fact that the goddess is displeased is the reason for the sacrifice. She is attempting to appease an enemy or an unfavorable authority figure to improve her own standing or ""change her attitude.""

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) People are often eager to treat their enemies well in the hopes of gaining something by it.** This reflects the crow's behavior. She treats her ""antagonist"" (the goddess who hates her) with the honor of a sacrifice specifically to gain a better reputation or ""credibility.""
*   **B) Pick your enemies.** This doesn't fit; the relationship is already established.
*   **C) Hope shines through skepticism.** While the crow is hopeful, the fable specifically highlights the strategic nature of appeasing those who dislike us.
*   **D) A hopeful, wise person will not attempt anything without having the critical means to achieve it.** This contradicts the story, as the dog argues the crow lacks the ""means"" (credibility) to be successful.
*   **E) Generosity can forge unlikely friendships.** The sacrifice isn't about friendship; it's about shifting a power dynamic/reputation.

In the classic collections of Aesop's Fables (such as the Perry Index), this specific fable (Perry 212) is used to illustrate that people often try to win over their enemies or those who despise them through offerings or kindness in hopes of reconciliation or gain.

The story goes that when a male hyena was treating a female badly, she said to him",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"In this fable, attributed to Aesop, the core lesson revolves around the reversal of roles and the consequences of mistreatment.

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1.  **The Premise:** The story is based on the ancient (though biologically incorrect) folklore that the hyena changes sex periodically.
2.  **The Conflict:** The male hyena is mistreating the female hyena. He holds a position of power or dominance over her in their current state.
3.  **The Warning:** The female warns the male that their roles will eventually reverse. Because she will become the male (the dominant one) and he will become the female (the subordinate one), his current actions will dictate how she treats him in the future.
4.  **The Moral Meaning:** The story serves as a warning to those currently in power or in a position of authority. It suggests that statuses are not permanent, and those who are being mistreated today may hold power tomorrow. Therefore, one should treat others well, knowing the ""tables may turn.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) People who have been judged in the past can later on be in a position to judge their former teachers.** This captures the essence of role reversal and the situational shift in authority. In many classical translations of Aesop, this specific moral is used to describe how a ""subordinate"" or ""student"" may one day hold power over their ""master.""
*   **B)** There is no flattery or deceit in this specific interaction.
*   **C)** The story is about a cycle/change, not necessarily a hidden nature.
*   **D)** While ""double-natured"" is mentioned, the story focuses on the *consequences* of behavior during the cycle, not the mistrust of the ambiguity itself.
*   **E)** This is too modern and self-help oriented; the fable is a warning about interpersonal behavior.

The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the source of the conflict:

1.  **The Alliance:** The lion and the dolphin form an alliance based on their status (kings of their respective realms).
2.  **The Peril:** The lion enters a battle with a wild bull and requires physical assistance on land.
3.  **The Failure:** The dolphin wants to help but is physically unable to leave the water. His ""nature"" prevents him from assisting.
4.  **The Lesson:** The lion feels betrayed, but the dolphin points out that he is simply limited by his environment.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This matches the core issue. The alliance failed because, despite mutual respect, the dolphin's nature made him unable to provide aid during the lion's moment of peril. When choosing allies, one must consider if they are physically capable of helping in the specific situations where help will be needed.
*   **B:** The story explicitly states the dolphin did *not* have an inclination to betray; he wanted to help but couldn't.
*   **C:** While true that the bull was a ""wild adversary,"" the central lesson focuses on the failed partnership, not the strength of the enemy.
*   **D:** This is a generic motivational statement that doesn't address the specific conflict of the fable.
*   **E:** While technically true, it is less specific than Option A. The fable is a classic Aesop's fable (""The Lion and the Dolphin""), and the traditional moral focuses on choosing allies suited to the task.

The most accurate moral is that when forming alliances, it is essential to consider the practical ability of those allies to provide support when called upon.

1.  **The Situation:** A predator (the fox) attempts to deceive a prey (the cicada) using flattery to lure it into a trap.
2.  **The Turning Point:** The cicada is not fooled. He tests the fox by dropping a leaf, confirming the fox's predatory intent when the fox pounces on it.
3.  **The Lesson:** The cicada explains *why* he was so cautious: ""I've been on my guard against foxes ever since I saw the wings of a cicada in the spoor of a fox.""

The core takeaway is that the cicada became wise and prepared because he observed what happened to others of his kind (the ""misfortunes of his neighbors""). He saw evidence of a previous cicada being eaten by a fox and used that knowledge to protect himself from the same fate.

*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the cicada's final line about learning from the ""wings of a cicada in the spoor of a fox.""
*   **B)** There is no mention of divine judgment.
*   **C)** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific reason for the cicada's success.
*   **D)** This describes a ""self-fulfilling prophecy,"" which is the opposite of what happens (the cicada successfully avoids his fate).
*   **E)** This is a partial truth, but the story's emphasis is on the cicada's wisdom gained through observation rather than just the fox's nature.

According to Aesop's Fables (where this story originates), the moral is that wise men learn from the misfortunes of others.

The Wolf, who lay lurking just by, heard this",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The setup:** A mother goat instructs her kid to be cautious and not open the door to anyone while she is away.
2.  **The conflict:** A wolf overhears this and attempts to deceive the kid by ""counterfeiting"" (imitating) the mother's voice to gain entry.
3.  **The resolution:** The kid is observant. Even though the wolf successfully mimics the voice, the kid looks out the window and sees the physical reality of the wolf.
4.  **The lesson:** The wolf is a hypocrite—he is pretending to be something he is not (a friend/mother) for a malicious purpose. However, despite his practiced deception, his true nature/identity is revealed through careful observation.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) A hypocrite can usually be found out:** This fits perfectly. The wolf acts the part of the goat, but his true identity is discovered.
*   **B) Many pretend to be concerned...:** This refers to a different type of fable (usually involving vultures or false friends at a deathbed).
*   **C) Caring hearts can see through counterfeit desires:** While the kid saw through the cheat, the story is more about caution and the failure of a disguise than ""caring hearts.""
*   **D) No cautious arguments...:** This relates to cowardice, which is not the theme here; the kid is being wise, not cowardly.
*   **E) Neglecting careful oversight...:** The mother actually provided good oversight/instruction, and the kid followed it, so this doesn't fit the outcome.

Apollo immediately explained to the snake, 'If you had simply killed the first person who ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A snake is constantly being stepped on by people. This suggests that the snake is seen as harmless or a pushover, leading to repeated mistreatment.
2.  **The Interaction:** The snake seeks out Apollo (a god associated with prophecy and wisdom). Apollo points out a tactical error the snake made.
3.  **The Lesson provided by Apollo:** Apollo explains that if the snake had retaliated forcefully against the *first* person who stepped on it, word would have spread that the snake is dangerous. This initial act of punishment/retaliation would have served as a deterrent, preventing others from stepping on it in the future.
4.  **The Broader Application:** The fable illustrates that a swift, decisive response to a transgression (even if it seems harsh) establishes a boundary. In a social or legal context, punishing the first offender serves as a public example that discourages others from committing the same act.

Evaluating the options:
- **A** aligns perfectly with the idea of deterrence—that punishment of one serves as a warning to all.
- **B** discusses delayed punishment, whereas Apollo advocates for immediate retaliation.
- **C** suggests immediate actions are bad, while the story suggests the opposite.
- **D** focuses on ""cleverness"" vs ""force,"" but the snake has the force (venom); it just failed to use it.
- **E** focuses on the sanctuary of the temple, which is merely the setting, not the lesson.

1.  **The Lion and the Robber:** The robber demands a share of the meat by force/expectation. The lion rejects him because the robber is already accustomed to taking through villainy and entitlement.
2.  **The Lion and the Wayfarer:** The wayfarer is modest and cautious, acknowledging the lion's power and showing no sense of entitlement to the kill. Because of this humility and lack of greed, the lion rewards him with ""the portion... that your modesty has earned for you.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This directly reflects the contrast between the two encounters. The robber (force) is resisted, while the traveler (humility) receives generosity.
*   **B:** There is no theme of betrayal in this specific interaction.
*   **C:** While the lion is kind, he isn't ""tamed""; he remains a powerful figure who chooses to be generous.
*   **D:** The ""villain"" (robber) is not cunning here; he is demanding and ultimately fails.
*   **E:** While the robber is entitled, this isn't the primary lesson regarding the reward given to the traveler.

The story highlights that virtue and humility are rewarded, while arrogance and greed are rebuffed. This is a classic Aesop-style fable (specifically Phaedrus, Book II, Fable 1) illustrating that the bold and wicked lose out while the modest are favored.

3.  **The Divine Warning:** The god intervenes not to ask for more, but to warn the man to stop. The god points out that if the man continues this ""squandering,"" he will eventually become poor and then unfairly shift the responsibility/blame onto the deity.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A:** Directly matches the god's warning. It highlights the human tendency to blame external/divine forces for hardships caused by one's own lack of moderation or foolishness.
*   **B:** There are no promises being made or broken in this story.
*   **C:** While the man is being extravagant, the core of the story is about the eventual redirection of blame, not the ""clouding of counsel."" 
*   **D:** The man doesn't seem to be seeking profit; he seems to be seeking favor or performing duty, albeit excessively.
*   **E:** While a logical life lesson, the text specifically focuses on the financial ruin and the resulting ""blame,"" which points more toward the psychological tendency described in A.

The fable serves as a warning against self-inflicted misfortune and the tendency to scapegoat others (or the gods) for the results of our own lack of self-control.

When he saw the reflection of his body in the water, he disparaged the slenderness of his legs but revelled in the shape and",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Conflict of Values:** The stag evaluates his own body parts based on aesthetics versus utility. He dislikes his legs because they are ""slender"" (thin/unattractive) and admires his horns because of their ""shape and size"" (beauty/grandeur).
2.  **The Test of Utility:** When the hunters appear, the legs he despised actually save him by allowing him to outrun the pursuers on level ground.
3.  **The Downfall:** The horns he was proud of become his undoing when they snag on tree branches, leading to his capture.
4.  **The Realization:** In his final moments, the stag explicitly states the lesson: the things he ""disparaged"" (underrated) were his means of salvation, while the things he ""boasted about"" (valued for vanity) caused his destruction.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the stag’s realization that his ""underrated"" legs were his most valuable asset.
*   **B:** While the stag was proud, the story isn't primarily about ""greed"" for honor, but rather a misjudgment of what is actually beneficial.
*   **C:** Persistence is not a primary theme of the story; the focus is on the utility of physical attributes.
*   **D:** There is no ""deceiver"" or ""falsehood"" being challenged; it is a story of internal misjudgment.
*   **E:** While close, ""Pride in appearances"" is part of the story, but the core irony emphasized in the text is the reversal of value—the transition from disparagement to salvation and boastfulness to destruction. 

Option **A** most accurately captures the central theme found in Aesop's traditional morals for this specific fable: that we often undervalue what is useful because it lacks beauty, and overvalue what is beautiful even if it is harmful.

But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot step-by-step:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Eagle, a powerful bird, ignores the Beetle's plea to spare the Hare. In doing so, she treats the smaller insect with physical disrespect, knocking her aside.
2.  **The Retaliation:** Despite being significantly smaller and weaker, the Beetle finds a way to strike back at the Eagle by destroying her eggs repeatedly.
3.  **The Escalation:** The Eagle seeks the highest protection possible from Jupiter (the king of the gods), yet the Beetle uses her unique traits (buzzing) to cause even Jupiter to accidentally drop the eggs.
4.  **The Resolution:** Jupiter recognizes the ""justice of [the Beetle's] cause,"" acknowledging that the Eagle was wrong to disregard the Beetle initially.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The story demonstrates that even the smallest or ""weakest"" creature (the Beetle) can find a method to take down or avenge themselves against a much ""stronger"" foe (the Eagle).
*   **B:** The story is about revenge and justice, not greed for honors leading to death.
*   **C:** While the Eagle lacked restraint, the primary focus is on the Beetle's successful revenge.
*   **D:** Leadership and beauty are not the central themes of this fable.
*   **E:** There is no compassion between the predator (Eagle) and prey (Hare); the Hare is killed, and the story focuses on the fallout of that event.

The moral is that even the most powerful cannot afford to despise or wrong those who seem weak, for the weak may find a way to strike back.

At a certain m",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the progression of the narrative:

1.  **The Accident:** The donkey accidentally falls, the salt dissolves, and the burden is lightened.
2.  **The Deception:** The donkey realizes he can manipulate the situation and intentionally falls a second time to avoid work.
3.  **The Realization:** The merchant notices the donkey's trickery (""The merchant realized what was happening"").
4.  **The Consequence:** The merchant outsmarts the donkey by replacing the salt with sponges. When the donkey tries the same trick, the sponges absorb water, making the load twice as heavy.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) You can fool someone only so many times:** This fits the narrative perfectly. The donkey successfully fooled the merchant once (by accident), tried to fool him again (on purpose), but the merchant caught on and punished the trickery.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you...:** This is not relevant to the plot of the story.
*   **C) Cunning minds see wicked traps:** While the merchant sets a ""trap,"" the focus of the fable is on the failure of the donkey's deceit, not the merchant's ability to see traps.
*   **D) Everyone should be satisfied with their own cunning lot...:** This is overly wordy and does not align with the standard moral of the donkey trying to gain an unfair advantage through trickery.
*   **E) Sometimes, accidents can lighten the load...:** This describes the inciting incident but misses the ""lesson"" or the outcome of the donkey's intentional actions.

The fable teaches that trickery often results in self-harm once the victim of the trick becomes aware of the deception. The most concise and accurate moral among the choices is that one cannot continue to deceive others indefinitely without consequences.

Even after stroking the animal he was not sure of its i,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Character's Ability:** The protagonist is a blind man who relies on touch and intuition rather than sight to identify animals. This suggests a focus on the ""nature"" or ""essence"" of a creature rather than its outward visual appearance.
2.  **The Situation:** He is presented with a cub (a young animal). Even though the animal is young and hasn't yet committed any ""crimes"" or hunts, the man senses something inherently dangerous about it.
3.  **The Conclusion:** He recognizes that regardless of its specific species (wolf or fox), its fundamental nature makes it a threat to sheep.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story suggests that even in youth, the inherent nature or ""evil"" tendencies of a creature can be detected by those who are perceptive. It implies that character is innate and can be recognized before it fully manifests in adult behavior.

Let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Evil tendencies are shown in early life:** This aligns perfectly with the man identifying the danger in a *cub*.
*   **B) Harsh means:** There is no mention of punishment or harsh treatment in the story.
*   **C) Appearances can be misleading:** While true in a general sense, the blind man literally cannot see ""appearances."" He is sensing the ""nature"" of the cub.
*   **D) Blind to reward/punish:** The story isn't about rewarding or punishing, but about identification and caution.
*   **E) Familiar may conceal truth:** The fox/wolf isn't necessarily ""familiar"" in a comforting way here; the focus is on its youth.

In traditional Aesop's Fables (where this story originates), the moral is commonly cited as ""Evil tendencies are shown in early life"" or ""The nature of a creature is known even in its youth.""

This man noticed that all sorts of people came to him, and he became curious to see who were true friend",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s look at the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Situation:** A rich man is generous and provides food for many, resulting in a table full of guests.
2.  **The Test:** He creates a hypothetical scenario of danger (a fight requiring swords) to see who is loyal beyond the ""free meal.""
3.  **The Result:** Out of a large crowd of guests, only two are willing to risk their safety for him. The narrator concludes that these two are ""friends,"" while the rest were merely ""hangers-on.""

**Analysis of options:**
*   **B** is irrelevant (seems to refer to a fable about animal life).
*   **C** and **E** touch on generosity, but the focus of the climax is the rarity of the outcome (the small number of friends found).
*   **D** describes the behavior of the freeloaders, but the classic ""moral"" of such fables usually highlights the value or scarcity of true friendship.
*   **A** directly addresses the conclusion of the story: out of a multitude of associates, only a tiny fraction proved to be real friends. This is the timeless takeaway from tests of loyalty.

The story serves as a cautionary tale that many people will enjoy your prosperity, but very few will support you in adversity. Therefore, true friends are rare and hard to distinguish without a trial.

The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, 'Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch m",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the relationship between the two pots:

1.  **The Characters:** One pot is made of brass (strong, durable, and heavy) and the other is made of earthenware (fragile, brittle, and easily broken).
2.  **The Situation:** Both are being carried by the same river (life/circumstance).
3.  **The Conflict:** The earthenware pot recognizes that even a slight touch from the stronger brass pot will result in its destruction. Despite being in the ""same boat"" (the river), they are not equals in terms of vulnerability.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that an alliance or close proximity between the powerful and the weak—or the ""sturdy"" and the ""fragile""—is inherently dangerous for the weaker party. Therefore, true safety and sustainable friendship are best found among those of equal status or strength, as their interactions do not pose an existential threat to one another.

- **Option A** captures the traditional Aesopic moral: a friendship between unequals often leads to the ruin of the weaker party.
- **Option B** is incorrect because the earthenware pot is actually very aware of its worth and fragility.
- **Option C** and **Option E** are modern, inclusive interpretations but do not reflect the cautionary nature of the classical fable.
- **Option D** is a nonsensical phrase in this context.

Historically, this Aesop fable is summarized by the proverb: ""Equals make the best friends.""

The wild boar replied, 'I have",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** The wild boar is sharpening his tusks (preparing for a fight) during a time of peace/quiet.
2.  **The Question:** The fox questions the necessity of this action since there is ""no immediate need"" (no visible threat).
3.  **The Reasoning:** The boar explains that he is preparing *now* so that when danger actually arrives, he doesn't waste time preparing and can instead defend himself immediately.
4.  **The Core Lesson:** The story emphasizes the importance of being prepared in advance for future challenges or threats.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace.** This aligns closely with the theme of preparation for conflict/danger before it arrives. In some translations of Aesop's Fables, the moral is phrased as ""Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace"" or ""It is too late to whet the sword when the trumpet sounds.""
*   **B) God is the ultimate judge.** This has nothing to do with the story.
*   **C) Curiosity must be guided by prudence.** This focuses on the fox's questioning, but the story's weight is on the boar's preparation.
*   **D) Prudent men feel worst when they contribute to their own inquisitive undoing.** This is a common moral for ""The Fox and the Eagle"" or similar stories, but doesn't fit here.
*   **E) Even nature prepares its own defenses.** While somewhat relevant (the boar is nature), it's more of an observation than a moral lesson for humans to follow.

Option A captures the essence of the boar's strategy: preparing for conflict during peacetime ensures readiness and serves as a deterrent/defense mechanism.

When the depositor then summoned him to swear an oath regarding the deposit, he realized the danger he was in and prepar",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Plot:** A man plans to embezzle a friend's deposit. To do so, he must swear a false oath. 
2.  **The Encounter:** He meets the god Oath, who claims he only revisits cities every 30 or 40 years to punish the wicked.
3.  **The Action:** Believing he has decades before any divine retribution will occur, the man commits perjury the very next day.
4.  **The Twist:** The god Oath reappears immediately to punish him.
5.  **The Lesson:** When the man points out the discrepancy in timing, Oath explains that while he *usually* takes a long time, he can return the same day if provoked by a flagrant or intentional act of malice.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) There is no fixed day on which wicked people are punished:** This directly reflects the god's explanation. The man thought punishment followed a predictable cycle, but learned that justice can strike at any moment, especially when one tries to ""game the system.""
*   **B) More good in one man than a crowd:** Irrelevant to the story.
*   **C) Fear distorts truth:** While the man was afraid, it was his greed and overconfidence in a ""schedule"" of punishment that led to his downfall.
*   **D) Inciting strife vs. taking part:** This refers to a different type of fable involving conflict or warmongers.
*   **E) Lasting debt on conscience:** The story focuses on external divine punishment (the cliff) rather than internal guilt or conscience.

The fable serves as a warning that divine justice is unpredictable and that one should not assume they have time to escape the consequences of their actions.

1.  **Initial Situation**: The farmer relies on neighbors to help him harvest. The mother Lark remains calm, knowing that when someone depends on others to do their work, the task is rarely urgent or guaranteed to happen.
2.  **The Turning Point**: The farmer realizes the neighbors aren't coming and the grain is falling. He decides to take action himself, hiring laborers and committing to doing the work personally.
3.  **The Mother Lark's Reaction**: Only when the farmer takes personal responsibility (""he no longer trusts his friends, but will reap the field himself"") does the Lark realize the danger is imminent.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Self-help is the best help:** This aligns perfectly with the story's lesson. The harvest only moves forward when the owner stops waiting for others and takes charge himself.
*   **B) Cunning often outwits itself:** Not applicable; there is no trickery involved.
*   **C) Wisdom grows with determination:** While the farmer is determined, the core lesson is about personal responsibility rather than the acquisition of wisdom.
*   **D) Do unto others...:** This is the Golden Rule, which is not the focus of this story.
*   **E) Even the tiniest cradle...:** This is a poetic sentiment about the birds, but not the moral lesson regarding the farmer's actions.

The fable teaches that you cannot rely on others to do your important work; if you want something done, you must do it yourself.

As soon as he realized what was going on, Aesop -- who w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the progression of the narrative and the specific metaphor used by Aesop:

1.  **The Context:** Aesop is playing children's games (marbles). An onlooker mocks him, assuming that a wise man should always be serious or ""on task.""
2.  **The Metaphor:** Aesop uses an unstrung bow as a visual aid. He explains that a bow that is always under tension (tightly strung) will eventually lose its elasticity or snap. 
3.  **The Lesson:** Just as a bow needs periods of rest to remain functional and strong, the human mind and spirit need periods of play or relaxation to remain sharp. If a person is constantly ""strained"" with serious work or intellectual labor without a break, they will ""break"" or become ineffective.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Resting the mind is essential for clear thinking:** This aligns perfectly with the bow metaphor. Relaxation is necessary to maintain long-term capability.
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for:** This is irrelevant to the story.
*   **C) Mockery often masks confusion:** While the man was confused by the bow, the primary lesson Aesop intended was about the necessity of his own playfulness.
*   **D) Be prepared to defend your position:** This describes what Aesop did, but it isn't the *moral* he explicitly explained.
*   **E) Wisdom often hides behind playful appearances:** This is a secondary theme, but it doesn't capture the specific mechanical lesson of the ""unstrung bow"" regarding the necessity of rest.

The explicit explanation provided by Aesop (""if you let it rest, it will be ready to use whenever you need it"") points directly to the importance of recuperation and relaxation for the mind.

1.  **The Sow's Position:** The sow boasts about the **quantity** of her offspring (a ""whole litter""). She measures her success or worth by the large number of children she produces.
2.  **The Lioness's Position:** The lioness acknowledges she has only one child, but emphasizes the **quality** (""well bred"") and the nature of that child (a lion). 
3.  **The Contrast:** The fable contrasts the commonality and high volume of the sow's piglets with the singularity and excellence of the lioness's cub. The punchline, ""but he is a lion"" (or ""he is very well bred""), implies that one superior thing is worth more than many inferior things.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Quality is more valuable than quantity:** This directly maps to the contrast between the many piglets and the single lion.
*   **B) Gossips are to be seen and not heard:** This does not fit the dialogue.
*   **C) Confidence without humility leads astray:** While the sow is boastful, the story focuses specifically on the numerical comparison.
*   **D) Setting aside disputes...:** This is a moral more suited to a fable about war or collective danger.
*   **E) Nurturing is key:** The focus is on the inherent nature/value of the offspring, not the act of upbringing.

1.  **""Running swiftly""** and **""balancing on the razor's edge""**: This indicates that opportunity is fleeting and exists in a delicate, momentary state.
2.  **""Bald but with a lock of hair on his forehead""**: This is a classic allegorical representation. You can grab him as he approaches (by the hair on his forehead), but you cannot grab him once he has passed because the back of his head is bald.
3.  **""Once he has moved on not even Jupiter himself can pull him back""**: This emphasizes that once a window of opportunity closes, it is gone forever, and no amount of power (even that of the king of the gods) can retrieve it.
4.  **""Symbol of Opportunity, the brief moment in which things are possible""**: The text explicitly states that this is about the nature of timing and possibility.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Seize opportunities when they arise:** This aligns perfectly with the imagery of grasping him from the front before he passes.
*   **B) Be content with your lot:** The story is about action and timing, not contentment.
*   **C) Power without purpose is ineffectual:** While Jupiter is mentioned, the focus is on the fleeting nature of time, not the misuse of power.
*   **D) Boast of one powerful thing...:** This relates more to fables like the Fox and the Cat; it doesn't fit the ""Opportunity"" allegory.
*   **E) Every daring act teeters on the fine line...:** While there is a ""razor's edge"" mentioned, the core message is about the irreversibility of missed timing.

The moral is that because opportunity is fleeting and impossible to reclaim once it passes, one must act immediately when it appears.

He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the behavior of the characters:

1.  **The Fox's Action**: The fox knows the trap is dangerous (she is ""pondering every possible approach"" because she recognizes the risk). When the wolf asks for the meat, she uses excessive flattery (""one of my very dearest friends"") to encourage him to walk into the danger she is avoiding.
2.  **The Wolf's Action**: The wolf takes the fox's words at face value without questioning why she hasn't taken the food herself. He pays the price for trusting a known trickster's sudden ""generosity.""
3.  **The Conclusion**: The wolf realizes the fox's ""gift"" was actually a trap. The story highlights that people who use flattery or false kindness to lead others into harm are dangerous and untrustworthy.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Flatterers and deceivers are not to be trusted.** This directly matches the fox's behavior (flattery and deception) and the wolf's realization.
*   **B) Know yourself and your limits.** While the wolf was greedy, the focus is more on the fox's betrayal.
*   **C) Trust can be a double-edged sword.** This is a bit too vague; the story specifically warns against *deceptive* sources of trust.
*   **D) A single reliable skill...** This is the moral of the fable ""The Fox and the Cat,"" not this specific story.
*   **E) Caution is wise...** This sounds more like a modern business proverb and doesn't capture the treachery of the fox.

The primary lesson is that one should be wary of ""gifts"" or kindness from those who use flattery to hide their true, deceptive intentions.

4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights how easily people make promises when they are in need or anticipating a change, but how quickly those promises are discarded or excused away once they have secured their own comfort and luxury. It serves as a warning against trusting the words of those who offer future rewards while they are pursuing their own interests.

Looking at the options:
*   **A is the most fitting:** It directly addresses the broken promise made by the beetle who found ""good times"" (plenty of food) but failed to deliver on his word.
*   B is incorrect as there is no conflict or fight involved.
*   C is a literal observation of the beetle finding food, but not a moral lesson.
*   D relates to timing of work/play, which is not the focus of the beetle's interaction.
*   E is an observation of the nature of dung beetles, but does not capture the central conflict of the broken promise.

morables_393,"There were two frogs whose pond had dried up, so they went looking for a new place to live. When they came to a well, one of them thought that they should jump in immediately, but the other one said, ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Situation:** Two frogs have lost their home and discover a well. One frog sees an immediate solution to their problem (the water in the well) and wants to act instantly by jumping in.
2.  **The Conflict:** The second frog pauses to consider the long-term consequences. While the well solves the immediate problem of thirst/habitat, its structure (being deep) presents a significant risk: if the water dries up (as it did in their last pond), they would be trapped at the bottom with no way to climb out.
3.  **The Lesson:** The second frog's advice centers on the importance of thinking through the potential consequences of an action before committing to it.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) Look before you leap:** This idiom means you should think about the possible dangers or consequences of a situation before you act. It aligns perfectly with the frog's warning about being unable to get back out.
*   **B) Watch the actions of your enemy:** There are no enemies in this fable; the frogs are companions.
*   **C) Haste often leads to regret:** While related, ""Look before you leap"" is the more specific and traditional moral associated with this particular Aesop's fable (""The Two Frogs"").
*   **D) Impulsive, vicious people...:** This describes a completely different type of story (like ""The Scorpion and the Frog""), as neither frog is portrayed as vicious.
*   **E) Adaptability is key:** The story is less about adapting to the dry pond and more about the specific decision-making process regarding the well.

The most accurate and traditional moral for this story is ""Look before you leap.""

morables_368,"Thanks to his excellent qualities, Hercules was received into heaven. He saluted the gods who came to congratulate him one after another, but when he was approached by Plutus, the god of wealth and th",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context**: Hercules is admitted to heaven because of his ""excellent qualities"" (his virtue and heroic deeds).
2.  **The Conflict**: While he greets all other gods, he pointedly ignores Plutus, the god of wealth.
3.  **The Reasoning**: When questioned by Jupiter, Hercules explains his disdain: Plutus is a ""friend to the wicked"" and ""corrupts the entire world."" He views wealth as a force that rewards those who lack virtue and undermines moral integrity.
4.  **The Lesson**: The fable contrasts Hercules' ""excellent qualities"" (virtue/merit) with Plutus’ ""money"" (material wealth). Hercules’ rejection signifies that wealth is often associated with corruption and is inferior to true virtue.

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Coffers of cash put a stop to honest traffic in praise:** This captures the idea that money corrupts and prevents the ""honest"" recognition of merit. In many classical translations of Aesop (like those by Phaedrus or Townsend), this specific wording or sentiment is the traditional moral: that wealth makes it impossible for praise to be given honestly because it favors the wicked.
*   **B) Easy life and seeming good fortune...**: This focuses on the danger to the wealthy themselves, which isn't the primary focus here.
*   **C) Wealth cannot buy true excellence:** While true to the story, it doesn't fully capture Hercules' specific complaint about wealth *corrupting* the world.
*   **D) Corrupting thieves...**: This focuses on thieves, which is irrelevant to Hercules.
*   **E) Virtue paves the path to the highest rewards:** This describes the first sentence but ignores the main dialogue/conflict regarding Plutus.

In the classic tradition of Aesop's fables, this story (known as *Hercules and Plutus*) specifically warns that wealth corrupts social and moral recognition. Option A aligns with the classical interpretation that ""money hinders the honest exchange of praise"" by favoring the unworthy.

morables_301,"A dog made false accusations against the sheep, demanding that she pay him back a loaf of bread which, he insisted, the sheep had supposedly borrowed from him. The dog summoned the wolf as his witness",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Conflict:** A dog makes a false accusation against an innocent sheep.
2.  **The Deception:** A wolf provides false testimony (perjury) to help the dog, making the situation even worse for the sheep.
3.  **The Injustice:** Due to the lying witness, the sheep is punished for a debt she did not owe.
4.  **The Resolution:** Shortly after the injustice, the wolf (the liar) is found dead.
5.  **The Conclusion:** The sheep interprets the wolf's death as a divine punishment for his dishonesty.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Wicked liars generally get their just consequences:** This aligns perfectly with the sheep's final statement about the ""reward"" given to liars. The story illustrates ""poetic justice"" or retribution for deceit.
*   **B) Harsh means vs. Reason:** This does not apply, as no ""kind means"" or ""reason"" were attempted; it was a matter of fraud.
*   **C) Deception masks innocence:** While true in the middle of the story, the primary lesson focuses on the outcome for the deceiver.
*   **D) Putting up with insults:** The sheep didn't ""put up"" with it by choice; she was forced by a verdict.
*   **E) Fabric of trust:** While the story involves a breach of trust, the climax is about the liar's downfall, not the societal impact on trust.

The sheep’s explicit commentary clarifies that the story is meant to show that though liars may succeed in the short term, they eventually face a grim fate.

morables_428,"A Lark, caught in a snare, pleaded earnestly with the Fowler for her life. 'What have I done that I must die?' said she; 'I have stolen neither gold nor silver, but only a grain of corn to satisfy my ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of this fable, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A Lark is trapped and facing death at the hands of a Fowler. 
2.  **The Plea:** The Lark attempts to use reason and logic to save herself. She argues that her ""crime"" (eating a grain of corn) is insignificant and does not justify the death penalty, especially since she has not stolen valuables like gold or silver.
3.  **The Response:** The Fowler does not engage with her logic, nor does he offer a counter-argument or a trial. He simply acts as the predator/judge.
4.  **The Outcome:** The Fowler ignores the plea entirely and kills the Lark.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A:** This fits the story perfectly. The Fowler is the adversary (the one catching the bird) and the judge (the one deciding if she lives or dies). Since he has a vested interest in the outcome (getting food/his catch), the Lark's logical arguments are useless. 
*   **B:** While the Lark died for a grain of corn, the story focuses more on the futility of her plea rather than a warning against greed.
*   **C:** This is the opposite of what happens; silence was the precursor to a lack of mercy.
*   **D:** This is a convoluted statement that doesn't align with the direct nature of this fable.
*   **E:** The story proves the opposite—sincerity was powerless in this situation.

The story highlights the harsh reality that when a person with power over you also intends to harm you, logical or moral appeals are often ignored.

morables_82,"Be quiet now, said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap. If you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf. Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of this fable (Aesop's ""The Nurse and the Wolf""), let’s analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Promise/Threat:** The Nurse tells the child she will throw him to the Wolf if he keeps crying.
2.  **The Expectation:** The Wolf hears this and takes it as a factual promise. He waits patiently, believing he will be fed.
3.  **The Reality:** The child cries, but instead of fulfilling her words, the Nurse protects the child and sets the dogs on the Wolf.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Wolf learned the hard way that the words of an enemy (or someone in an adversarial position) are not reliable. Specifically, the ""promise"" was never intended to be kept; it was simply a tool used to influence the child.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Enemies' promises were made to be broken:** This fits perfectly. The Wolf relied on the words of a human (a natural enemy) and found that those words were empty.
*   **B)** Focuses on blame, which isn't present here.
*   **C)** Focuses on silencing fears, which doesn't address the Wolf's perspective.
*   **D)** Focuses on ""serving"" the wicked, but the Wolf wasn't serving; he was hunting.
*   **E)** While the Nurse was protecting the child, the classic moral of this specific Aesop fable focuses on the folly of believing the ""promises"" of those who do not have your interests at heart.

In classical collections of Aesop's fables, this story is most frequently paired with the moral: ""Enemies' promises were made to be broken"" (or ""Do not believe everything you hear"").

Then the fly laughed at the man and said, 'You wanted to avenge the sting of a ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the conflict:

1.  **The Conflict:** A man is harmed by an external source (the fly) and inadvertently harms himself while trying to address it.
2.  **The Fly's Mockery:** The fly mocks the man's self-inflicted pain, suggesting that the man is foolish to hurt himself in the pursuit of vengeance over a minor sting.
3.  **The Man's Defense:** The man distinguishes between his **intent** and the **result**. He forgives himself for the slap because he ""did not try to hurt [himself] on purpose."" Conversely, he justifies the self-inflicted pain as a worthy sacrifice to destroy a malicious enemy.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Intent matters more than the outcome:** This is the core of the man’s argument. He justifies the slap based on his intention (killing the fly) rather than the physical pain (the outcome).
*   **B) Sharing/Rudeness:** This is irrelevant to this specific fable.
*   **C) Forgiveness outshines mockery:** While he forgives himself, the story's climax is his justification of his aggressive intent toward the fly.
*   **D) Frustrated self-effort:** This is a bit vague and doesn't capture the dialogue's focus on intentionality.
*   **E) In anger, we cause more harm:** While this is a common interpretation of similar fables, the man explicitly rejects this logic in the text, stating he would endure even ""greater inconvenience"" to achieve his goal.

The man's specific rebuttal—""I can easily forgive myself since I know that I did not try to hurt myself on purpose""—points directly to the importance of intent over accidental outcomes. In the original Phaedrus fables (where this originates), the moral is often stated as ""Intent defines the act.""

morables_60,"A quarrel had arisen between the Horse and the Stag, so the Horse came to a Hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the Stag. The Hunter agreed, but said: 'If you desire to conquer the Stag, you mus",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events:
1.  **The Conflict**: The Horse seeks revenge on the Stag but cannot defeat him alone.
2.  **The Deal**: The Horse asks a human for help. The human agrees, but only if the Horse submits to being saddled and bridled (relinquishing control/freedom).
3.  **The Result**: The enemy (the Stag) is defeated, but the Horse finds he is now permanently enslaved by the Hunter, who refuses to release him.

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **A**: This is very close, but the phrasing ""for your own purposes"" suggests the Horse is the one initiating the usage. While true, the core of the fable focuses on the loss of liberty.
*   **B**: This is a classic interpretation of this specific Aesop's fable (*The Horse, the Hunter, and the Stag*). It emphasizes that seeking revenge by giving up your power to someone stronger results in a loss far greater than the original injury.
*   **C & D**: These do not fit the narrative arc well; the focus is not on ""cunning"" but on the trade-off of freedom for vengeance.
*   **E**: While true, it is slightly less precise than the traditional moral regarding the trade-off between revenge/protection and liberty.

**Analysis of the Best Moral:**
The most accurate moral (frequently attributed to this fable across historical translations) is that in the pursuit of revenge or an advantage over a peer, one should not deliver themselves into the power of a master. Between the choices provided, **A** captures the transactional nature of the betrayal, but **B** captures the specific lesson of the fable: that the cost of seeking help to satisfy a grudge is often one's own sovereignty. 

However, looking at standard standardized versions of this fable's moral, **A** is the most frequent ""textbook"" lesson regarding the danger of letting others gain control over you, even if you think you are using them.

You have such ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interaction between the cat and the stork:

1.  **The Context**: The cat wants the stork's eel but doesn't want to get wet or exert effort to hunt. He uses words to achieve his goal.
2.  **The Strategy**: First, the cat tries flattery (""O most beautiful bird!"") to get the stork to open her mouth. When the stork remains silent to protect her prize, the cat switches to insults and ""sour grapes"" logic, calling the stork ""filthy"" for her diet.
3.  **The Stork's Reaction**: The stork ignores both the flattery and the insults. She remains silent and keeps walking, ensuring she does not lose her meal.
4.  **The Lesson**: The primary takeaway is the stork's behavior. By refusing to engage with the cat’s manipulative speech—whether it was the initial ""cunning, deceptive words"" of flattery or the subsequent insults—she successfully kept her eel. The story warns the reader not to be swayed or ""seduced"" by the words of those who have hidden motives, as responding to them would lead to trouble (losing the eel). 

While ""Flattery often masks hidden intentions"" (E) is a common theme in fables, the story explicitly shows the cat moving from flattery to insults, and the moral focuses on the danger of being swayed by such manipulative rhetoric. Choice D most accurately captures the danger of listening to those using speech to trick you.

'At the moment I am thi",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the behavior of the characters:

1.  **The Opportunity:** The wolf had a clear opportunity to eat the dog while it was vulnerable on the ground.
2.  **The Deception:** The dog used a persuasive promise (getting ""fattened up"" at a wedding) to trick the wolf into delaying his meal.
3.  **The Result:** Once the dog was safe (on the roof), he reneged on the deal. The wolf lost his initial meal and was left with nothing because he waited for a ""better"" version of the prize that never existed.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Take what you can get when you can get it:** This aligns perfectly with the wolf's mistake. He had a sure thing but let it go for a future promise. This is a classic Aesop-style moral (similar to ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"").
*   **B) Liberty:** While the dog gained freedom, the story focuses more on the trickery and the wolf's missed opportunity than the philosophical value of liberty.
*   **C) The cunning prey on the gullible:** While true, this is a description of the characters rather than the specific lesson regarding the *timing* of the wolf's mistake.
*   **D) Cunning enemies' persuasive promises...:** This is overly complex and mischaracterizes the dog as a ""predatory nature"" in this context. 
*   **E) A plea for mercy...:** The dog wasn't really pleading for mercy based on pity, but rather making a business deal.

In many classical translations of this specific fable (often titled ""The Dog and the Wolf""), the moral is summarized as: **""Wise people should not let go of what they have in hand for the sake of an uncertain expectation.""** This is most accurately captured by option A.

When he finally decided to disembark, he said, 'I will let myself down now as fast as I can so as not to burden",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the behavior of the characters:

1.  **The Gnat’s Perspective:** The gnat believes his presence is a significant ""load"" or ""burden"" to the camel. He presumes that his departure is a major event that will provide relief to the larger animal. This demonstrates self-importance and an inflated sense of one’s own impact.
2.  **The Camel’s Perspective:** The camel is completely unaware of the gnat. To the camel, the gnat’s weight is non-existent compared to the actual baggage he carries. He corrects the gnat’s ego by pointing out that the gnat's arrival and departure are equally inconsequential.
3.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A:** This directly addresses the contrast between the gnat’s high self-opinion (""consequence in their own eyes"") and the camel’s indifference (""than in the eyes of their neighbors"").
    *   **B:** While the gnat is arrogant, ""influence"" isn't the primary theme—self-perception is.
    *   **C & D:** These focus on the camel's patience or wisdom, but the satirical point of the fable is the gnat's vanity.
    *   **E:** While true in a literal sense, it lacks the critical lesson about vanity found in Aesop-style fables.

The fable teaches that people often overestimate their importance or the effect they have on others.

The fox turned to the women and said, 'What shouts there would be aga",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the fox and the women:

1.  **The Observation:** The fox sees humans eating their own livestock (chickens) in peace.
2.  **The Comparison:** The fox feels there is a double standard. He notes that if he were to eat those same chickens, he would be hunted, shouted at, and chased by dogs.
3.  **The Correction:** An old woman points out the fundamental difference between their actions: The women are consuming what rightfully belongs to them (""those things which are ours""), whereas the fox's ""pleasure"" comes from theft (""things that belong to others"").
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that rights and permissions are tied to ownership and legality. Just because someone has the right to use or consume their own property doesn't mean a stranger or a thief has the right to do the same.

Analysis of the options:
- **A)** Directly addresses the distinction between how people treat their own property versus how others are permitted to treat that same property. This aligns perfectly with the old woman's retort.
- **B)** Does not apply; there is no friendship or betrayal in the story.
- **C)** While the women are eating in silence, the lesson isn't about ""wisdom"" outsmarting a ""feast,"" but about the right of ownership.
- **D)** This is a general proverb about malice but doesn't fit the context of the fox's complaint about property rights.
- **E)** This describes the setting but is a literal observation rather than a moral lesson.

Why are you trying to wound me with your teeth,",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the viper and the file:

1.  **The Characters:** A viper (a creature with venomous teeth representing a predator or an aggressor) and a file (a tool made of hardened steel designed to wear down other hard objects).
2.  **The Action:** The viper attempts to bite the file, trying to hurt or consume it.
3.  **The Reaction:** The file points out the futility of the viper's action. The file is much harder and more durable than anything the viper's teeth can affect; in fact, the file's purpose is to destroy the very material the viper is attacking with.
4.  **The Lesson:** The viper is attacking something that is impervious to its bite and actually holds the power to destroy the aggressor. It is a warning against attacking those who are stronger, harder, or ""insensible"" (impervious/unfeeling) to the attack.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) It is useless attacking the insensible:** Historically, in Aesop's fables, this specific story (""The Viper and the File"") is used to illustrate that it is foolish to attack something or someone that cannot be hurt by you, or someone who is naturally equipped to resist and overcome your specific weapons. The term ""insensible"" here refers to the file being unaffected by the bite.
*   **B) Mere words are no help:** This doesn't fit, as the file's strength isn't about words, and the viper isn't asking for help.
*   **C) Curiosity without wisdom invites folly:** While the viper was testing the file, the main point is the futility of the attack on a superior object, not just curiosity.
*   **D) Foolish injuries...:** This doesn't fit the context of the file's nature.
*   **E) Boasting of strength...:** The file isn't boasting until it is attacked; the viper starts the conflict.

The traditional moral associated with this fable is that one should not attack those who are more powerful or who are impervious to one's efforts. Option A captures the essence of attacking something ""insensible"" (incapable of feeling or being affected by the attack).

As they were disputing, they passed a statue carv",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the Man and the Lion:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Man and the Lion are arguing over who is superior.
2.  **The Evidence:** The Man points to a statue as ""proof"" of human superiority because it depicts a man defeating a lion.
3.  **The Counterpoint:** The Lion points out a fundamental bias: the statue was created by a human. If a lion had been the sculptor, the statue would depict the opposite outcome.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that ""evidence"" or ""truth"" often depends on the perspective of the person telling the story or creating the monument. Every story has two sides, and the person in power (the artist/the narrator) determines the narrative.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) One story is good, till another is told:** This aligns perfectly with the Lion's point. The Man's ""proof"" only seemed definitive because the Lion's perspective hadn't been represented yet.
*   **B), C), D), and E):** While elements of pride and boasting exist in the story, they do not address the Lion's specific rebuttal regarding the source and bias of the statue.

1.  **The Peacock’s Character:** The story establishes that the peacock is both beautiful and ""gentle and courteous."" This suggests he values his reputation and the opinions of others.
2.  **The Exchange:** The raven offers to ""squawk your praises"" in exchange for feathers. This is a direct appeal to the peacock's desire for status and recognition (vanity).
3.  **The Downward Spiral:** The peacock continues to give away his essential feathers to various birds (the crow, cuckoo, etc.) in order to maintain this cycle of praise and courtesy. 
4.  **The Consequence:** By prioritizing the external validation (the ""praises"") and the desire to be seen as generous or great by others, he loses the very things he needs for survival (protection from winter) and for his responsibilities (protecting his chicks). 
5.  **The Result:** His vanity and the need for public praise lead to his literal destruction and the abandonment of his duties.

Looking at the options:
- **A** fits perfectly: His vanity (desire for praise) led him to give away his means of survival, resulting in his death.
- **B** is incorrect because the peacock actually had the feathers.
- **C** describes the other birds (the opportunists), but the focus of a fable's moral is usually the protagonist's mistake.
- **D** does not apply as the peacock died rather than showing resilience.
- **E** contradicts the ending, as his kindness led to his death rather than a positive outcome.

You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth as a w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot progression:

1.  **The Conflict:** A small Gnat challenges a mighty Lion, asserting that the Lion’s size and strength (claws and teeth) are no match for the Gnat’s agility.
2.  **The Victory:** The Gnat successfully defeats the Lion by attacking his sensitive spots. The Lion ends up harming himself in frustration.
3.  **The Turn of Events:** After his great victory, the Gnat flies away ""buzzing about in a song of triumph"" (boasting/pride).
4.  **The Downfall:** Because he is preoccupied with his triumph and fails to notice a small, mundane danger, he is caught in a spider's web and eaten.
5.  **The Realization:** The Gnat laments that after defeating the ""hugest beasts,"" he is killed by an ""inconsiderable"" insect.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) No matter how you brag, you can be undone.** This fits the narrative well, as the Gnat’s celebration of his victory leads directly to his careless demise.
*   **B)** This focuses on a ""supplicating"" enemy; the Gnat was never humble or supplicating.
*   **C) Pride can turn triumph into frustration.** This is close, but the Gnat experienced more than just frustration—he experienced total ruin/death.
*   **D)** This focuses on the Gnat outwitting *himself*, whereas he was actually outwitted by a spider (or his own lack of attention).
*   **E)** This is a generic lesson on strength, but doesn't cover the second half of the story regarding the spider.

Standard interpretations of this Aesop's fable (The Gnat and the Lion) emphasize that the most successful person should fear the slightest misfortune, or that pride and boasting after a victory often lead to a downfall by a lesser power. Option A most accurately captures the transition from the Gnat's boastful victory over a giant to his sudden undoing by a tiny spider.

morables_361,"Some fishermen had gone out fishing, and when they had struggled for a long time but had not managed to catch anything, they became very downcast and prepared to turn back. All of a sudden a tuna fish",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events provided in the fable:

1.  **Preparation and Effort:** The fishermen are working hard (""struggled for a long time"") but their skill and effort yield no results (""not managed to catch anything"").
2.  **Despair:** They are ready to give up and are ""downcast.""
3.  **The Event:** Without any action from the fishermen, a tuna fish jumps into their boat by complete accident (fleeing another predator).
4.  **The Outcome:** They achieve their goal (catching a fish) through a stroke of fortune rather than their own fishing techniques.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Luck often bestows the things that skill cannot obtain:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The fishermen's skill failed them, but luck (the tuna jumping in) provided the success they couldn't earn through labor.
*   **B) To be small is a way to stay safe...:** This relates to other Aesop fables (like the Reed and the Olive Tree) but doesn't apply here, as the fish was caught.
*   **C) Joy can outpace despair:** While true to the plot, it is a description of the fishermen's feelings rather than a ""moral"" or lesson about life's mechanics.
*   **D) Rejoicing equals make the best pursuing friends:** This is nonsensical in the context of the story.
*   **E) Perseverance becomes its own reward:** The fishermen were actually prepared to ""turn back"" (give up), and their reward came from chance, not the act of persevering.

The fable teaches that sometimes chance or providence provides what hard work cannot.

Not withstanding all his prayers, instead of becoming richer, he got poorer. Out ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the final realization of the character:

1.  **The Setup:** A man prays to a Wooden Idol for wealth, and despite his devotion, he becomes poorer. He maintains a belief system (worshipping the idol) as long as he hopes it will bring him a profit.
2.  **The Climax:** In a fit of frustration (impatience), he destroys the idol.
3.  **The Outcome:** The destruction of the idol reveals the gold hidden inside. 
4.  **The Realization:** The man immediately changes his perspective on the deity. He stops ""worshipping"" it and instead mocks its ""graceless"" nature, concluding that force was more effective than prayer.

**Evaluating the Options:**
- **A) People adjust their beliefs based on what is profitable for them.** This matches the man's behavior. He worshipped the idol while he thought it would make him rich, and immediately insulted and discarded his religious devotion once he realized the physical destruction of the idol yielded the actual profit.
- **B) Only a man who is out of his mind...** This is irrelevant to the plot of the story.
- **C) Impatience can lead to graceless outcomes.** While the man was impatient, the outcome was actually positive (he got the gold), not ""graceless"" in a negative sense.
- **D) Impatient opposites are...** This is a nonsensical phrase in the context of the fable.
- **E) Fortune favors the bold who challenge fate.** While the man was ""bold"" in breaking the idol, the core of the story (and the point of the man's final exclamation) is about the shift in his attitude toward the object of his worship once the source of profit changed.

In the tradition of Aesop's fables (from which this story originates), this specific tale is often used to illustrate that some people only respect or ""believe"" in things as long as they serve their interests, or that a change in fortune causes a shift in one's convictions.

1.  **The Challenge:** A tiny gnat (insignificant) challenges a mighty bull (powerful). 
2.  **The Mistake:** By simply accepting the challenge and showing up for the ""show,"" the bull grants the gnat a status it didn't previously have. The gnat claims that because the bull accepted, they are now ""equals.""
3.  **The Outcome:** The gnat gains fame and boasting rights without actually fighting, while the bull is left frustrated and looks foolish for entertaining such an inferior opponent.
4.  **The Explicit Lesson:** The last sentence states that if the bull had ignored the gnat as being ""beneath contempt"" (ignoring the unworthy opponent), the gnat would have had nothing to boast about.

Looking at the options:
- **A)** aligns perfectly with the text. By acknowledging the gnat, the bull lowered himself to the gnat's level and damaged his own dignity.
- **B)** is irrelevant to the story.
- **C)** is a general maxim, but doesn't fit the specific outcome (the bull didn't ""fall,"" he was simply humiliated/manipulated).
- **D)** is nonsensical in this context.
- **E)** suggests the gnat's pride, but the story's warning is directed at the *bull's* failure to ignore an unworthy adversary.

The story warns that by engaging with those far beneath our status or merit, we validate them and diminish ourselves.

The owner began to question the dog, asking how he could be so ungra",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the conflict between the owner and the dog:

1.  **The Conflict:** The owner claims to be ""kind"" because he personally never hit the dog or spoke a harsh word. He views his own behavior as virtuous because he did not physically perform the acts of cruelty.
2.  **The Dog's Argument:** The dog points out that he was still beaten and mistreated, but the owner simply outsourced the violence to ""others"" by giving the order. To the dog (and to logic), there is no difference between the person who delivers the blow and the person who commands it.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches that delegating a task—especially a cruel or harmful one—does not absolve the person in charge of responsibility. The consequences of an order belong to the one who gave it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Directly aligns with the dog's point: an action done through an agent is the responsibility of the principal.
*   **B:** While the owner might be considered ""wicked,"" the focus is on the action/command, not a specific ""danger lurking in words.""
*   **C:** The story suggests the kindness was fake or non-existent, not that genuine kindness was unappreciated.
*   **D:** This relates to trust and safety, but doesn't capture the core of the master-servant order dynamic.
*   **E:** This is a minor plot point (how the dog was found) but not the moral lesson.

The moral is that delegating an action does not relieve one of the moral or practical responsibility for that action.

Even when they saw one of",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the sequence of events and the sheep's realization:

1.  **Reaction to Danger:** The sheep observe a clear threat (the butcher) entering their flock. Instead of uniting or acting, they ""pretend not to see him.""
2.  **Individualism/Apathy:** As their peers are taken away one by one, they take comfort in the fact that they personally have not been chosen yet (""He keeps his hands off me""). They fail to see that a threat to one is ultimately a threat to all.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because they did not act when they had the strength of numbers, the sheep are slaughtered until only one remains. 
4.  **The Conclusion:** The final sheep realizes that their fatal mistake was failing to act collectively at the very beginning (""we should have killed you at once by smashing you between our horns"").

Now, let's look at the options:
*   **A)** matches the theme perfectly. It highlights the failure of the sheep to support one another, resulting in total destruction. This is a classic ""First they came..."" scenario.
*   **B)** is the moral of a different fable (like ""The Frogs Desiring a King"").
*   **C)** is a general truth but doesn't capture the specific social/collective failure of the story.
*   **D)** relates to rhetoric and does not apply here.
*   **E)** refers to trying to blend in with powerful people, whereas the sheep were ignoring a predator, not trying to fit in with him.

The core lesson is that by ignoring the plight of their peers, the sheep ensured their own eventual demise.

1.  **The Action:** A hooligan commits a reckless act (striking Aesop with a stone).
2.  **The ""Success"":** Instead of punishment, Aesop rewards him with a coin. This positive reinforcement makes the hooligan believe his bad behavior will yield ongoing profit and success.
3.  **The Trap:** Because the hooligan was successful once, he is emboldened to try the same reckless behavior on someone much more powerful.
4.  **The Ruin:** His previous ""success"" leads him directly into a trap where he is captured and executed.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Success leads many astray to their ruin:** This fits perfectly. The hooligan’s initial ""success"" (getting a coin from Aesop) misled him into thinking he could continue his behavior with impunity, ultimately leading to his death.
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for:** The hooligan wasn’t wishing for something that backfired; he was pursuing a reward through violence.
*   **C) Clever minds outwit reckless wealth:** Aesop is clever, but the second victim is described as wealthy/important, not ""reckless wealth.""
*   **D) Avoid reckless overindulgence in manipulative pursuits:** This is too wordy and doesn't quite capture the ""false success"" aspect.
*   **E) Responding with grace can disarm hostility:** Aesop didn't respond with grace to ""disarm"" him; he responded with a trick to ensure the hooligan was punished by a higher authority.

Historically, this fable from Phaedrus (Book 3, 5) is titled ""Aesop and the Hooligan"" or ""Success Leads to Ruin."" The lesson is that initial success in a bad deed often encourages a person to repeat the deed on a larger scale, leading to their ultimate downfall.

1.  **Winter’s Perspective:** Winter boasts about being like a ""dictator or a despot."" He takes pride in his power to frighten people, force them into submission, and make them ""tremble"" or stay confined indoors. He equates power with control and fear.
2.  **Spring’s Perspective:** Spring responds by pointing out that because of Winter's harshness, people want to be ""rid of"" him. In contrast, Spring is welcomed with joy. People love Spring because she brings freedom and pleasure, and they ""give thanks"" when she appears.
3.  **The Comparison:** The fable contrasts two types of influence: one based on intimidation and restriction (Winter) and one based on beauty and goodwill (Spring). While Winter sees his ability to cause fear as a sign of strength, Spring reveals that this actually makes him disliked.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) It is better to be loved than feared:** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between Winter (the feared despot) and Spring (the beloved season). Spring points out that being loved creates a lasting, positive legacy, whereas being feared makes people wish for your departure.
*   **B) Blame:** No one is being wrongly blamed in this story.
*   **C) Power can be both:** While true, the story specifically argues that one form of power (Spring's) is superior to the other.
*   **D) Talent in the hands of the unappreciative:** The story isn't about talent; it's about the nature of how one treats others.
*   **E) Harshest seasons have beauty:** The story actually emphasizes the lack of appreciation for Winter due to his harshness, rather than finding a hidden beauty in him.

The central lesson is that being a ""despot"" who makes others tremble is less desirable than being someone whose presence brings joy and whose absence is mourned.

Everyone wondered at this, since the new horse was neithe",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the narrative:

1.  **The Situation:** A soldier owns an excellent horse (proven quality and utility).
2.  **The Action:** He buys a new horse that is objectively inferior—less beautiful and less useful.
3.  **The Behavior:** He gives significantly more care and attention to the inferior new horse than to the superior old one.
4.  **The Explanation:** The observer notes it is ""natural to be fond of the newest arrival,"" implying that the novelty of the new object (despite its lack of merit) outweighs the proven value of the old one.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A:** This focuses on the fleeting nature of pleasure, but the story is more specifically about the misplaced value put on something new versus something worthy.
*   **B:** This discusses contentment and disaster, which are not present in the text.
*   **C:** The story actually shows the soldier ignoring beauty *and* usefulness in favor of novelty, so this contradicts the theme.
*   **D:** This mentions ""wicked men,"" which is irrelevant to the soldier and his horses.
*   **E:** This directly summarizes the soldier’s behavior: he is valuing an inferior object (the new horse) more than the one that ""truly deserves"" care (the excellent horse).

The fable serves as a critique of human nature's tendency to be distracted by novelty and to neglect what is truly valuable in favor of what is new.

1.  **Analyze the Plot:** A seagull attempts to eat something that is physically unsuitable for it (a fish too large) and ventures into a domain (predatory fishing) that leads to its demise.
2.  **Analyze the Kite’s Commentary:** The Kite’s remark is the focal point of the moral. He points out that the seagull, a ""bird of the air,"" overstepped its natural boundaries/limitations by seeking food from the sea in a way it couldn't handle.
3.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A) Every man should be content to mind his own business:** This aligns with the classical interpretation of this Aesop fable (*The Kite and the Seagull*). It warns against meddling in affairs or environments for which one is not suited by nature.
    *   **B) Learn from past misfortunes:** The seagull dies, so it cannot learn from this mistake.
    *   **C) Greed breeds misfortune...:** While greed (bolting a large fish) is present, the Kite’s specific critique is about the seagull's ""business"" or station in life.
    *   **D) How often do we supply...:** This refers to giving enemies weapons to use against us, which doesn't happen here.
    *   **E) Patience is key:** The story is about overreaching, not a lack of patience.

They urged one another to approach the river, but no one dared to get too close bec",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of foxes is thirsty and standing by a dangerous river. They are hesitant to drink because the current is fast.
2.  **The Action:** One fox, motivated not by a need to drink safely but by a desire to ""embarrass her fellow foxes"" and show off her bravery, leaps into the dangerous water.
3.  **The Consequence:** The current immediately sweeps her away. She is unable to get the drink she wanted and is now in a life-threatening situation.
4.  **The Response:** When her companions call out to her, she attempts to save face by making up an excuse (carrying a message to Miletus) to hide the fact that she has lost control and is being swept to her death/danger.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) People get themselves into trouble because of their boasting:** This fits perfectly. The fox’s pride and desire to mock others led her to take a reckless risk that resulted in her being swept away.
*   **B) Greedy men chase after profit...:** There is no ""profit"" or ""greed"" here, only thirst and ego.
*   **C) Boldness quenches the cautious thirst:** This is incorrect; the fox’s boldness resulted in her being swept away without actually drinking.
*   **D) Cautious bad neighbours...:** While the fox was mocking, the ""cautious"" ones (the onlookers) are not the ones suffering; the boaster is.
*   **E) Caution is wise, but courage is needed...:** The story actually warns *against* this type of reckless ""courage"" that leads to disaster.

The fable (attributed to Aesop) is a classic warning against ""alazoneia"" (boastful pretension). The fox’s hubris led her into a situation she could not handle.

1.  **The Lion's Conflict:** The lion attempts to suppress his predatory nature to maintain an image of fairness. However, he cannot change his ""natural inclinations"" (his hunger).
2.  **The Trap:** He devises a ""no-win"" scenario. He asks animals a question (""Does my breath smell?""). Those who are honest (saying it smells bad) are killed. Those who lie/flatter (saying it smells good) are also killed.
3.  **The Monkey's Fate:** The monkey attempts extreme flattery (likening the breath to a divine altar). While this saves him temporarily from the first trap, the lion simply crafts a new excuse to eat him anyway.
4.  **The Core Lesson:** The story illustrates that when a predator/tyrant decides to act on their nature, the specific response of the victim (whether honesty, silence, or flattery) does not change the outcome. The lion was determined to eat; the ""justice"" or ""reasons"" were merely pretenses.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits the theme that Regardless of whether the animals were honest or flattering, the result was death. However, the monkey spoke, so ""silence"" isn't explicitly tested, but the ""penalty for any answer"" is clear.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there are no ""old friends"" in this story.
*   **C:** While flattery is present, the story is more about the *futility* of flattery when dealing with a powerful predator.
*   **D:** This is the moral for a different fable (The Ass in the Lion's Skin).
*   **E:** The story shows the opposite; the leader (lion) fails to maintain integrity.

Option A is the most traditional moral associated with this specific fable (often attributed to Phaedrus or Babrius), emphasizing that for those determined to do evil, there is no ""right"" thing to say to save oneself. Even though the monkey tried a third path (extreme flattery), he met the same end as the honest ones.

The partridge immediately started squawking his usual song, sauntering through every room in the house un",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the behavior of the characters and the conflict between them:

1.  **The Action:** A partridge is newly introduced to a household. He immediately behaves with high confidence, ""sauntering"" everywhere and ""squawking"" or ""cackling"" loudly, despite being a brand-new arrival.
2.  **The Conflict:** The weasel, a long-term resident, confronts the partridge. The weasel’s argument is based on **social hierarchy and tenure**. The weasel points out that even though she has lived there for a long time and comes from a ""lineage"" of residents (the mouser-slayer), she remains quiet and humble.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story critiques the partridge for acting with excessive boldness and noise (""confident vanity"") before understanding his place or respecting the existing environment. This behavior makes him a target for the ""tricky"" weasel, who uses the partridge's own arrogance to challenge his right to be there. 

While **A** deals with household customs, the core of the fable (attributed to Babrius/Aesop) centers on the foolishness of a newcomer acting with misplaced, loud-mouthed confidence in a new environment, which invites hostility or destruction from those already established there.

- **Option D** correctly identifies ""Confident vanity"" as the partridge’s flaw and ""tricky self-destruction"" as the outcome (as the ""tricky weasel"" is confronting him in a way that implies danger).
- **Option A** is a common interpretation of similar fables, but the text specifically highlights the contrast between the partridge's loud ""cackling"" and the weasel's long-term quietude, emphasizing the vanity of the newcomer.

1.  **The Situation:** The fox is in trouble (slipping) and reaches out for help.
2.  **The Choice:** The fox grabs a bramble bush—a plant naturally characterized by its thorns and propensity to ""grab"" or snag anything that touches it.
3.  **The Outcome:** The fox is hurt by the thorns.
4.  **The Lesson:** The bramble points out that the fox was ""out of her mind"" to expect a different outcome. The bramble is not being intentionally malicious toward the fox specifically; it is simply acting according to its inherent nature (to catch and scratch).

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) It is foolish to expect help from someone who is naturally unkind:** This fits the story well. Seeking aid from a source that is inherently harmful (like a thorn bush) is a mistake in judgment by the seeker.
*   **B)** This relates more to luck vs. skill (not relevant here).
*   **C)** While cruelty is mentioned, the story focuses more on the *nature* of the entity being asked for help.
*   **D)** This refers to a different Aesop fable (*The Fox and the Cat*).
*   **E) In seeking support, be mindful of the harm it may cause:** This is a plausible modern interpretation, but traditional interpretations of this fable emphasize the folly of the person seeking help from an inherently dangerous source.

In the context of classic fables, the primary lesson is that you should not expect kindness or safety from someone whose very nature is to cause harm or who treats everyone as prey/an object to be ""grabbed.""

morables_246,"A charcoal burner who lived in a certain house decided it would be a good idea to live together with a fuller who had moved in next door. But the fuller told him, 'How on earth would I be able to carr",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the roles of the two characters:
1.  **The Charcoal Burner:** His profession involves soot, dust, and black residue.
2.  **The Fuller:** His profession involves cleaning cloth and making it perfectly white.

The fuller realizes that their lifestyles and goals are fundamentally at odds. If they live together, the charcoal burner’s work will inevitably ruin the fuller’s work. The story illustrates that people with incompatible natures or conflicting interests cannot successfully join together in a shared enterprise or living situation.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) Opposites are utterly incompatible:** This aligns perfectly with the text. The soot of the charcoal burner and the whiteness of the fuller's cloth represent two opposite states that cannot coexist in the same space without one destroying the other.
*   **B) Appearances can be deceiving:** This is not relevant here; the fuller sees the situation exactly as it is.
*   **C & D):** These options are wordplay or non-sequiturs that do not fit the logical progression of the fable.
*   **E) Shared spaces require shared understanding:** While true in a general sense, the fable specifically highlights the physical and inherent incompatibility of their natures, making ""A"" the more accurate classical interpretation.

This fable is traditionally attributed to Aesop, where the stated moral is ""Like will draw to like"" or that ""Opposites are incompatible.""

morables_446,"A robber had murdered someone along the road. When the bystanders began to chase him, he dropped the bloody corpse and ran away. Some travellers coming from the opposite direction asked the man how he",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Action:** A murderer attempts to hide his guilt by lying. He claims his bloody hands are stained from climbing a mulberry tree (using the tree as a scapegoat).
2.  **The Consequence:** The murderer is caught and executed on that very same tree.
3.  **The Climax:** The tree speaks, stating it is happy to assist in his execution because the murderer tried to defame/slander it by blaming it for his own crime.

**Step-by-step analysis of the options:**
*   **A:** This option highlights that even ""honest people"" (or in this case, the inanimate ""honest"" tree) will not hesitate to participate in the punishment of someone who has slandered them. The tree's dialogue explicitly focuses on the fact that the man tried to ""smear"" its reputation.
*   **B:** Equanimity refers to composure under pressure; the story is about justice and retribution, not composure.
*   **C:** While travelers were curious, the actual capture and the tree's reaction focus on the retribution for the lie.
*   **D:** This refers to greed and deceptive honors, which are not the primary themes of this specific fable.
*   **E:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific irony of the tree's participation in the execution, which is the ""punchline"" of the fable.

In the classic collections of Aesop's Fables (where this story originates), the moral traditionally associated with this tale (The Murderer and the Mulberry Tree) is that even those who are naturally peaceful or ""honest"" will turn against someone who tries to shift their own guilt onto them.

morables_430,Some field-mice were playing in the woods where a lion was sleeping when one of the mice accidentally ran over the lion. The lion woke up and immediately grabbed the wretched little mouse with his paw,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and character dynamics:

1.  **The setup:** A powerful creature (the lion) shows mercy to a weak creature (the mouse) even though the mouse is insignificant and cannot seemingly offer anything in return.
2.  **The turning point:** The powerful creature finds itself in a situation where its strength is useless (trapped in a net/pit).
3.  **The resolution:** The weak creature uses its specific small-scale abilities (gnawing) to save the powerful creature, explicitly stating it is returning the favor (""I have not forgotten the kindness"").
4.  **The lesson:** The story illustrates that mercy and kindness are valuable regardless of the status of the recipient, because even the smallest being may one day be in a position to help a much greater one.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted:** This perfectly captures the theme. The lion's ""small"" mercy towards a ""tiny"" creature resulted in his eventual survival.
*   **B) Unequal matches bring misery:** This is the opposite of the story's outcome; the unequal match brought salvation.
*   **C) Cleverness can free the trapped:** While true, it misses the core theme of reciprocity and kindness.
*   **D) Pretending to help while acting in self-interest:** The mouse was genuinely helping the lion out of gratitude, so this doesn't apply.
*   **E) Even the smallest actions can awaken great consequences:** While somewhat relevant, it is too vague. This often refers to causing trouble (like the mouse waking the lion), whereas the story's climax is focused specifically on the reward of kindness.

The classic moral of Aesop's ""The Lion and the Mouse"" is that ""Little friends may prove great friends"" or that kindness is always rewarded. Option A is the most accurate representation.

When they had admitted him into the cote, they found that he made more havoc and slew a l",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the plot and the consequences for the characters:

1.  **The Situation:** The Pigeons are afraid of a predator, the Kite. Though the Kite is a threat, the story implies his impact is relatively limited (""pounce upon in a whole year"").
2.  **The Solution:** To solve the problem of the Kite, the Pigeons invite a more powerful predator, the Hawk, to protect them.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Hawk (""the remedy"") causes significantly more damage and death in a single day than the Kite (""the disease"") would have caused in an entire year.
4.  **The Lesson:** By trying to escape a minor threat, the Pigeons invited an even greater disaster upon themselves. The solution they chose was far more destructive than the original problem.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease:** This directly matches the outcome. The Hawk (remedy) was worse than the Kite (disease).
*   **B)** This focuses on ""wicked"" characters fighting each other, which isn't the primary focus here.
*   **C)** While the Hawk was destructive, the story emphasizes the scale of the damage compared to the original threat rather than a complex deception.
*   **D)** This relates to different Aesop fables (like those involving a wolf and a lamb).
*   **E)** While partially true, it is a more modern interpretation. The classic moral of this specific fable (often titled *The Pigeons and the Hawk*) focuses on the ""remedy vs. disease"" comparison.

In the tradition of Aesop’s fables, this story is the quintessential illustration of choosing a ""cure"" that is more dangerous than the original affliction.

morables_394,"When Zeus had fashioned man and woman, he ordered Hermes to take them to Gaia, the Earth, and to show them how to obtain food by digging in the ground. At first, the Earth refused to cooperate in Herm",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of this story, let’s analyze the sequence of events and the final statement made by the Earth:

1.  **The Context:** Zeus creates humans and intends for them to survive by farming (""digging in the ground"").
2.  **The Conflict:** Gaia (the Earth) is initially reluctant to allow her surface to be torn up and exploited for food.
3.  **The Resolution:** Hermes forces her compliance via Zeus's authority.
4.  **The Consequence (The Moral Core):** The Earth agrees because she must, but she warns that the process of obtaining sustenance (gains) will come at a heavy price: ""groans and tears.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Easy gains often come with hidden costs and hardships:** This aligns with the Earth's decree. While humans gain the ability to feed themselves from the earth, it is not ""free"" or easy; it is accompanied by suffering and hard labor.
*   **B) Do not fight with those who are perfectly capable of fighting back:** While Gaia ""fights back"" with a curse/prophecy, the story focuses more on the inherent struggle of survival rather than a conflict between equals.
*   **C) Power can sway the reluctant:** While true (Zeus sways Gaia), this is a summary of a plot point rather than the ""lesson"" regarding the human condition that the fable aims to illustrate. 
*   **D) Powerful physical stature...:** Not relevant to the text.
*   **E) Guidance is the seed of self-sufficiency:** This is too optimistic for the tone of the fable, which ends on a grim note about suffering.

The fable serves as an explanation for why human life (specifically agriculture and survival) is defined by toil and hardship. Even though humans were given the ""gift"" of knowing how to farm, the Earth ensures that this gain is paid for with struggle.

The butcher turned around and said to him, 'You haven't stolen my heart; indeed, I have taken heart from this lesson! So if you eve",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Event:** A dog successfully steals a piece of meat (a heart) from a butcher's shop.
2.  **The Butcher's Reaction:** Instead of simply being angry at the loss, the butcher reflects on the experience. He uses a play on words, noting that while he lost a physical ""heart,"" he gained ""heart"" (meaning courage or a lesson in vigilance).
3.  **The Lesson:** The butcher explicitly states that he has learned from this mistake. He is now on his guard and warns the dog that because he is now aware of the dog's nature and methods, the dog will not succeed a second time and will instead face punishment.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Experience teaches valuable lessons and encourages caution:** This aligns perfectly with the butcher's statement (""I have taken heart from this lesson!"") and his newfound vigilance.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** While the dog acted according to its nature, the focus of the fable's conclusion is on the butcher's gain of wisdom through experience.
*   **C) Boldness without caution leads astray:** This might apply to the dog later, but the primary takeaway is the butcher's reaction.
*   **D) and E):** These themes (deceitful promises or betrayal of trust) are not present in this specific interaction.

In Aesopic tradition, this specific fable (often titled ""The Butcher and the Dog"") is used to illustrate that a single misfortune can be turned into a ""gain"" if it teaches a person to be more careful in the future.

When he saw a hard-working bull who was pulling a plow, the bullock said to him, 'You poor",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **Preparation vs. Toil:** The young bullock mocks the older bull for his hard work and ""miserable"" life under the yoke. The bullock enjoys a life of leisure because he is being ""spared"" the work.
2.  **The Reveal:** The reason for the bullock's leisure is revealed: he was being fattened and kept ""fresh"" for a ritual sacrifice.
3.  **The Turnaround:** The working bull is set free to graze (rewarded/spared due to his utility), while the idle bullock is led to his death.
4.  **The Lesson:** The bullock's initial mockery of the bull's ""burden"" was premature. The bull’s hard work eventually led to his survival, while the bullock's easy life led to a grim end.

Comparing this to the options:
*   **A) He laughs best that laughs last:** This fits perfectly. The bullock laughed at the bull initially, but the bull ended up in a position of safety while the bullock faced the axe. The final outcome reversed their status.
*   **B) The great do not always prevail:** Not applicable; the story is about work vs. idleness/fate.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers youthful naivety:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific irony of the reversal of fortune.
*   **D) He that is neither...:** Irrelevant to the text.
*   **E) One should not judge others...:** This is a secondary lesson, but fables of this type (traditionally Aesop's ""The Bullock and the Ox"") focus on the irony of the ""easy life"" leading to destruction.

morables_174,It is common to take Maltese dogs and pet monkeys on long sea voyages in order to relieve the boredom of the passage. A man who was planning to make such a voyage had brought his monkey along with him,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Context:** A monkey is being saved by a dolphin who mistakes him for a human.
2.  **The Lie:** When questioned about his background, the monkey lies about being a prominent Athenian to impress the dolphin.
3.  **The Exposure:** When the dolphin asks if he knows ""Piraeus"" (a famous harbor), the monkey mistakenly identifies it as a person who is a ""near and dear friend.""
4.  **The Consequence:** The dolphin realizes the monkey is a fraud/liar and, in his anger, stops helping him, leading to the monkey's death.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A:** This fits perfectly. The monkey pretended to be something he was not (a high-status Athenian human) and his lies literally led to him being dropped into ""deep water."" It is a classic metaphor and literal outcome for this fable.
- **B:** There is no ""crowd"" involved in the moral conflict of the story.
- **C:** The monkey's plans were deceptive, not ""helpful,"" and they caused infuriation rather than calming it.
- **D:** This is poorly phrased and grammatically confusing; while the dolphin was dangerous when infuriated, the core lesson is about the monkey's deception.
- **E:** The companionship failed specifically because of the monkey's lack of integrity, so it was not a source of strength.

The fable illustrates that boasting or lying about one's identity to gain favor often leads to exposure and disaster.

Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events:

1.  **The Context:** The Mice are in danger because the Cat has been eating them.
2.  **The Conflict:** The Mice adapt by staying in their holes for safety.
3.  **The Trick:** The Cat uses a ""device"" (faking death by hanging from a peg) to deceive the Mice into thinking the danger is gone.
4.  **The Resolution:** The Mice are not fooled. Having already experienced the Cat’s predatory nature, they recognize that no matter what appearance she takes (even a harmless meal-bag), she remains a threat.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) He who is once deceived is doubly cautious:** This fits perfectly. The Mice have seen the Cat's true nature. Because they were already ""deceived"" by her presence in the house moving toward their destruction, they exercise extreme caution regardless of her new disguise.
*   **B) False:** There is no collaboration between powerful/deceitful entities here.
*   **C) Caution tempers cunning:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific element of ""prior experience"" or ""past deception"" that the story highlights.
*   **D) False:** There are no subordinates involved.
*   **E) False:** This is a broad observation about the house being overrun, but not the lesson taught by the climax of the story.

The primary lesson is that once someone has shown themselves to be a threat or a liar, a wise person (or mouse) will not be fooled by their new tricks or disguises. This is a classic Aesop moral often summarized as ""The wise are not fooled by those who have once cheated them.""

Just as he was about to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and wak",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the text step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation:** A traveler settles down to sleep on the edge of a deep well—a precarious and dangerous position.
2.  **The Intervention:** Dame Fortune wakes him up, but not out of pure altruism. She does so to protect her own reputation.
3.  **The Argument:** Dame Fortune explains that if he had fallen in, people would have blamed ""bad luck"" or ""Fortune,"" when in reality, the calamity would have been caused by the traveler’s own foolishness (choosing to sleep on the brink of a well).
4.  **The Lesson:** The core of the fable is the distinction between random chance (Fortune) and personal responsibility. It highlights that humans often blame external fate for disasters that are actually the result of their own poor choices or negligence.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Everyone is more or less master of his own fate:** This aligns with the idea that our actions (or ""follies"") determine our outcomes more than external ""luck.""
*   **B) Every tale is not to be believed:** Irrelevant to the traveler's choice.
*   **C) Guard your energy wisely:** While the traveler was weary, the story focuses on *where* he slept, not the fact that he was tired.
*   **D) He who incites strife...:** This is the moral for a different fable (The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner).
*   **E) Exhaustion can lead to perilous oversight:** While true in a literal sense, the dialogue from Dame Fortune explicitly pivots the meaning to the concept of blaming Fortune versus taking responsibility for one's own fate.

1.  **The Request:** A man creates the head of an axe but cannot use it without a handle. He asks his potential victims (the trees) for the means to complete his tool.
2.  **The Cooperation:** The trees, perhaps thinking they are being helpful or sacrificing one of their own for peace, provide him with a handle made of hard wood.
3.  **The Betrayal/Consequence:** Once the man has the complete tool, he immediately uses it to destroy the very trees that helped him.
4.  **The Realization:** The trees recognize that they provided their enemy with the specific instrument of their own destruction.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A:** Captures the core of the story. By giving the man a handle, the trees armed their enemy.
*   **B:** While relevant to power dynamics, the story focuses more on the specific act of providing the tools for one's own downfall rather than the concept of ""impunity.""
*   **C:** This is a strong contender, as the trees were ""generous"" with the wood but lacked the ""wisdom"" to see how it would be used. However, Aesop's fables traditionally focus on the specific danger of aiding an adversary.
*   **D:** This is overly philosophical and relates more to coercion; the trees in this story gave the wood voluntarily.
*   **E:** This does not fit the narrative of the axe and the trees.

The fable (often attributed to Aesop) is a classic warning against providing the means of your own destruction to someone who does not have your best interests at heart. Option A most directly addresses the specific folly committed by the trees.

1.  **The Precept:** The mother crab gives her son a verbal instruction (precept) to walk straight instead of crookedly.
2.  **The Challenge:** The son asks the mother to demonstrate the behavior she is advocating (""Lead the way"").
3.  **The Failure:** The mother is physically unable to follow her own advice because it is against her nature/abilities.
4.  **The Lesson:** One cannot effectively teach or demand a behavior that they themselves do not or cannot practice. 

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Example is more powerful than precept.** This fits perfectly. A ""precept"" is a rule or instruction. The story illustrates that the mother's rule is useless because her own ""example"" (how she actually walks) contradicts it.
*   **B) Contentment with our lot...** This is unrelated to the conflict between mother and son regarding behavior.
*   **C) Those who cannot see the path...** While the mother is guiding him poorly, the core of the story is about the hypocrisy of her demands versus her actions.
*   **D) Hypocritical equals...** While hypocrisy is involved, the focus is on the teaching dynamic, and they are mother/son rather than ""equals.""
*   **E) Even the crooked can find their way...** The story ends with failure and accusation, not a successful finding of the way.

When the fox found out about this she paid a visit to the wolf a,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the characters and their actions:

1.  **The Characters:** Both the wolf and the fox are depicted as ""thieves"" or scavengers. The wolf has an ""immense store of booty"" (stolen goods), and the fox is attempting to trick the wolf to get a share of it.
2.  **The Conflict:** The wolf is spiteful and refuses to share his stolen goods. The fox, motivated by spite and greed, betrays the wolf to the shepherd.
3.  **The Outcome:** The wolf is killed by the shepherd (the thief is destroyed). The fox then eats the stolen food but is eventually caught and killed by hunters, realizing at the end that her downfall was a result of bringing about the death of another.
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A) Take pleasure when thieves destroy themselves:** This aligns with the classic interpretation of this Aesopic fable. Both the wolf (a thief of the flock) and the fox (a deceptive scavenger) are destroyed by their own vices—the wolf by his greed/spite and the fox by her betrayal/crime. The narrative shows the self-destruction of those who live by ill-gotten gains.
    *   **B) Never trust a known deceiver:** While the wolf was right not to trust the fox, his own spite led him to his death. This is a minor point compared to the ultimate fate of both ""thieves.""
    *   **C) Gratitude tempers relentless spite:** The story shows the opposite; spite leads to destruction.
    *   **D) Cunning wit has always a spiteful answer ready:** This describes the wolf's dialogue but isn't the overarching lesson of the entire plot (which includes the fox's death).
    *   **E) Isolation in abundance...:** This is factually incorrect based on the story's events.

The fable illustrates that those who live as ""thieves"" or through deception often meet a violent end, often brought about by their own actions or peers. In traditional collections (like the Perry Index), this fable is often summarized by the idea that one should take pleasure in seeing those who live by theft or malice destroy each other.

But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; ,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **Initial Conflict:** An Eagle and a Serpent are locked in a life-and-death struggle.
2.  **Act of Kindness:** A countryman intervenes to help the Eagle, saving its life and allowing it to escape.
3.  **Act of Malice:** The Serpent, seeking revenge on the man, poisons the man's water.
4.  **Reciprocated Kindness:** The Eagle, recognizing the danger to its savior, knocks the poisonous drink from the man's hand to save his life.

The core of the story revolves around the man helping the Eagle, and the Eagle subsequently returning the favor by saving the man's life. This is a classic illustration of mutual aid and gratitude.

- **Option A (One good turn deserves another)** directly reflects this cycle of gratitude and reciprocal kindness.
- **Option B** refers to greed, which is not present here.
- **Option C** describes the Serpent's action but misses the ultimate resolution/lesson of the Eagle's intervention.
- **Option D** focuses on the danger of revenge, but the story ends on the positive note of the Eagle's protection rather than the man's ruin. 
- **Option E** is a general observation but not the primary lesson of the interaction.

In Aesop's Fables, this specific story is traditionally used to illustrate that those who help others will often receive help in return.

morables_29,"A Rich Man gave a great feast, to which he invited many friends and acquaintances. His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, My master gives a feast, a",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Invitation:** A guest (the stranger dog) is invited to a feast not by the host (the Rich Man), but through a ""back door"" connection (the master's dog). He is an uninvited intruder in the eyes of the household staff.
2.  **The Expectation:** The dog enters the kitchen greedily, expecting to benefit from wealth he did not earn and to which he was not officially invited.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he has no legitimate right to be there, the Cook treats him as a trespasser and throws him out the window.
4.  **The Aftermath:** The dog hides his shame by pretending he was a legitimate guest who simply overindulged, but the reality is that his unofficial entry led to a violent exit.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. ""Entering by the back stairs"" is a metaphor for entering a place without a legitimate invitation or through unofficial means. The ""window"" represents the unceremonious and forceful removal that often follows such intrusion.
*   **B:** There were no enemies in this story, only a misguided friend and a protective cook.
*   **C:** While the dog had hope, the story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of intrusion, not a celebration of generosity.
*   **D:** There was no ""deceitful promise of safety""; the friend dog was sincere, just overconfident in his authority.
*   **E:** The story actually shows that generosity (the feast) has strict boundaries (the invited guests vs. the stray dog).

The fable teaches that if you sneak into a place where you don't belong, you should expect to be kicked out.

morables_707,"There was a certain miserly man who was dying and about to part with his enormous heap of money, ill-gotten as it was. He ordered that the bag of coins be brought to him as he was dying and then asked",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Character's Actions:** The man is described as ""miserly"" and his wealth as ""ill-gotten."" He spent his life ""sweating"" over coins (hoarding wealth at a great personal and moral cost).
2.  **The Outcome for the Wealth:** The bag of coins reveals that the money will not be used for anything the man would value; instead, his heirs will ""squander"" it on vice (""women and drinks""). This suggests that his ""toil"" resulted in a legacy he didn't intend or control.
3.  **The Outcome for the Man:** Because of how he acquired and kept the money, he faces ""eternal torments"" from demons.
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A:** While true to an extent, it doesn't fully capture the specific irony of the heirs squandering the money or the ""ill-gotten"" nature mentioned in the text.
    *   **B:** Irrelevant; this sounds like a moral for a fable about government or leadership.
    *   **C:** This is a strong contender, as the text explicitly mentions eternal torments for the soul due to the ill-gotten money. 
    *   **D:** This is the moral typically associated with a different fable (like ""The Camel and the Man""). It doesn't fit the themes of greed or legacy.
    *   **E:** This is a very strong fit. The man ""sweated"" over the coins thinking they were his achievement, but the ""fruits of [his] toil"" ended up feeding vices he likely wouldn't approve of, and his intended legacy (the security of the wealth) was lost.

**Comparison between C and E:** 
While C is a direct consequence mentioned in the text, fables often focus on the vanity of human effort and the irony of inheritance. However, looking at the direct dialogue provided by the bag, the focus is twofold: the loss of the money's value (waste) and the loss of the soul. Choice **C** specifically addresses the core consequence of ""ill-gotten gains"" which is explicitly stated in the first sentence and the conclusion of the dialogue. 

However, many collections of fables (such as those by Aesop or Odo of Cheriton) use this specific story to highlight how a miser's labor is ultimately for the benefit of others and his own damnation. Choice **C** is the most direct summary of the bag's warning regarding the ""ill-gotten"" nature of the wealth.

The city mouse finished his business in the country and by means of insistent inv,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Setup:** The story contrasts two lifestyles: the country mouse's simple, humble existence (eating acorns) and the city mouse's luxurious, abundant existence (overflowing delicacies).
2.  **The Conflict:** While the food in the city is superior, it comes with a high price: danger and constant fear. The city mouse is ""acquainted"" with the danger and has a hole to hide in, but he still lives in a state where his meal can be interrupted by a threat to his life at any moment.
3.  **The Resolution:** The country mouse realizes that the luxury of the city is not worth the terror and lack of security. He chooses to return to his ""humble meal"" because it allows him to live in peace and ""freedom.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches that a simple, poor life lived in safety and peace of mind is preferable to a wealthy life filled with anxiety and danger.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A:** Directly captures the trade-off between ""self-sufficient poverty"" (acorns/freedom) and the ""worries of wealth"" (the butler/danger).
*   **B:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't address the specific contrast between wealth/danger and poverty/security.
*   **C:** This describes the city mouse's comfort but ignores the main point—the country mouse's rejection of that lifestyle.
*   **D:** This is a moral for a different fable involving betrayal; it does not apply here.
*   **E:** This describes the plot's movement but not the ethical or philosophical takeaway.

The most accurate moral is that security and peace of mind are more valuable than luxury.

The beetle then felt contem",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative arc step by step:

1.  **The Starting Point:** The beetle begins in his natural habitat (a dung heap) but becomes dissatisfied after comparing himself to a superior creature (the eagle).
2.  **The Conflict (Arrogance/Hubris):** The beetle expresses contempt for his own life and makes boastful claims (""my voice is no less pleasant,"" ""her sheen does not outshine my own""). He abandons his community and his nature to ""consort with the birds.""
3.  **The Calamity:** Because he lacks the biological capability of an eagle, he cannot withstand the environment (strong winds). He fails in his attempt to be something he is not.
4.  **The Consequence:** He ends up ""shaken and exhausted, far away from his home,"" facing starvation and regretting his vanity. He realizes he would rather be a ""bug"" in a dung heap than a ""bird"" in exile.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The beetle's arrogance and ""putting on airs"" led to disaster, the failure of his new ambition, and the loss of his original security.
*   **B:** There is no ""wrong"" committed against the beetle to avenge.
*   **C:** The story is a cautionary tale against overextending oneself, not an endorsement of diversity.
*   **D:** This is from a different fable (The Eagle and the Beetle) or different context; there are no ""strong blows"" or physical fights here.
*   **E:** The story ends in tragedy/regret rather than a celebration of ""lofty wonder.""

The moral is a classic warning against hubris and abandoning one's station for vainglory.

I can't decide what to do: my love of money and my innat",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the character's internal conflict and his ultimate decision:

1.  **The Conflict:** The man discovers a ""lion of gold."" His **greed** draws him toward the value of the gold, but his **cowardice** makes him fear the form of the lion, even though it is an inanimate object.
2.  **The Struggle:** He laments that he has found a treasure he cannot bring himself to touch. He calls it a ""treasure that offers no satisfaction"" because his fear prevents him from seizing the opportunity himself.
3.  **The Resolution:** Instead of overcoming his fear to claim the prize, he decides to stay at a distance and have others do the work for him.
4.  **Evaluation of Options:**
    *   **A:** This fits well. The man has found immense wealth, but his character (cowardice) prevents him from enjoying it or interacting with it directly.
    *   **B:** This is a generic moral often applied to other Aesop fables (like the ""Lion in Love"") but doesn't fit the focus on greed and fear here.
    *   **C:** Greed isn't ""blinding"" him; if anything, his fear is making him overly cautious and paralyzed.
    *   **D:** This is a reversal of a common idiom and doesn't match the man's attempt to still get the gold via his servants.
    *   **E:** While he is indecisive, the core of the fable (traditionally attributed to Aesop) focuses on the paradox of a person who desires wealth but lacks the courage to face even the ""image"" of danger (the golden lion) to get it.

In classical interpretations of this fable, the lesson is that for a coward, even a stroke of good luck (finding gold) becomes a source of torment because they cannot muster the courage to claim or enjoy their fortune.

When opinions were exchanged back and forth, the ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interaction between the characters step by step:

1.  **The Setting:** The animals hold an assembly to address grievances and inequality.
2.  **The Hares' Argument:** The hares propose a system of total equality and fairness. They argue that the current disparity in strength allows the strong to prey upon the weak, which they find unjust.
3.  **The Lions' Retort:** The lions do not argue against the *ideal* of equality or the logic of the hares' words; instead, they point to a physical reality. They note that the hares' words ""lack both claws and teeth."" In other words, the hares have no power or force to back up their demands or enforce the equality they seek.
4.  **The Lesson:** This fable (traditionally attributed to Aesop) illustrates that abstract ideals, rights, or pleas for fairness often carry little weight in the real world unless they are backed by the power or means to defend them. The lions dismiss the hares' request not because it is logically flawed, but because the hares are physically unable to back it up.

Looking at the options:
- **A) Be prepared to defend your position:** This aligns with the lions' point that words without ""claws and teeth"" are ineffective.
- **B, C, D, E:** These either contradict the cynical reality of the story or introduce themes (like being of use or being loved) that aren't present in the text.

The story teaches that fine words and demands for equality are useless without the strength to support them.

There was a whole crowd of monkeys there and one of them ,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character motivations:

1.  **The Setting:** The men are in a land governed by irrationality (monkeys mimicking human hierarchy).
2.  **The Liar's Action:** He recognizes that the leader monkey has an ego and wants to be treated like an emperor. He provides blatant flattery (""You are the emperor!"").
3.  **The Liar's Reward:** Because the monkeys thrive on this deception and false status, the liar is rewarded.
4.  **The Truth-teller's Mistake:** He assumes that the truth is inherently valued or that it will be rewarded more than a lie. He fails to realize the environment he is in—one built on delusion.
5.  **The Outcome:** The truth-teller identifies the monkeys for what they actually are (""You are simply a monkey""). The leader, feeling insulted and having his illusion shattered, orders his followers to attack.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **B** and **D** are irrelevant to the specific conflict of the story.
*   **C** is partially true, but the story is more about the consequences for the speakers than just the gullibility of the monkeys.
*   **E** is the opposite of what happens; the truth leads to the man's harm, not his defense.
*   **A** captures the core dynamic: the monkeys (those who thrive on/prefer the deception) retaliate against the one who speaks the truth because the truth exposes their actual nature and ruins their vanity.

The fable teaches that in a society governed by vanity and lies, speaking the truth is not only unrewarded but often leads to punishment by those who benefit from the lie.

This slave-woman, bedecked with gold and trailing a delicate purple robe aro",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the key elements of the story:

1.  **The Characters:** A man, an ""ugly, wicked"" slave-woman, and the goddess Aphrodite.
2.  **The Conflict:** The man treats an unworthy person (the slave-woman) as if she were beautiful and precious, giving her finery and status she does not deserve.
3.  **The Climax:** The slave-woman believes his devotion is a blessing from Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty.
4.  **The Resolution/Lesson:** Aphrodite appears and explicitly rejects the woman’s gratitude. She clarifies that she did not make the woman beautiful, but rather expresses ""fury"" or disdain that the man is so deluded as to find the woman attractive or worthy.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A:** This aligns with the classical Greek interpretation of the fable (often attributed to Aesop). The goddess’s disgust suggests that the man's attraction is not a divine ""gift"" of beauty, but a sign of his own delusion or madness. In ancient fables, when a person values something objectively ""ugly"" or ""wicked"" as ""beautiful,"" it is viewed as a state of being ""out of one's mind.""
*   **B:** There is no mention of guilt or conscience in the story.
*   **C:** Generosity (the man's gifts) does not ""outshine"" her ugliness; it only makes her arrogant and causes the goddess to be angry.
*   **D:** The slave-woman is not beautiful, nor is she content; she is aggressive and demanding.
*   **E:** This is a modern sentiment and contradicts the tone of the fable. Aphrodite confirms the woman is *not* beautiful and finds the man's attraction to her offensive.

The fable serves as a warning against being deluded by unworthy objects of affection, suggesting that such irrationality is a sign of a cursed or unsound mind.

Aesop therefore shared this little story with the father,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of this story, let's analyze the lesson step by step:

1.  **The Problem:** A father has a son with a violent, unrestrained temper who harms others (the slaves) when not supervised.
2.  **The Farmer's Solution (The Metaphor):** The farmer yokes a mature, steady bull with a volatile young bull. The purpose is not to increase productivity, but for the older bull's calm and experience to serve as a physical and behavioral ""anchor"" to restrain the younger bull's dangerous impulses.
3.  **The Application:** Aesop explicitly tells the father to keep the boy beside him so that the father's ""moderation"" (wisdom and calm) can ""restrain"" the boy's ""reckless inclinations.""
4.  **The Moral:** The story emphasizes that the presence and guidance of a wise, steady influence can curb the destructive aggression of the young and reckless.

- **Choice A** mentions a mild disposition stopping vicious behavior, which is close, but focuses on the ""disposition"" rather than the active guidance/wisdom of an elder.
- **Choice B** and **D** are unrelated to the text.
- **Choice E** identifies the risk of unchecked behavior but misses the specific solution offered by the fable (the ""yoking"" to a wiser partner).
- **Choice C** (""Wisdom tempers reckless aggression"") most accurately reflects the farmer's strategy and Aesop's advice: using the steady wisdom of the old to restrain the dangerous energy of the young.

All the other passengers started to swim, but the Athenian kept praying to Athena, maki",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A ship capsizes during a storm. All passengers are in life-threatening danger.
2.  **The Contrast in Actions:** Most passengers begin to swim (taking physical action to save themselves). One wealthy Athenian stops and prays, relying entirely on divine intervention and promises of future piety.
3.  **The Climax:** A fellow passenger provides the ""lesson"" by telling the Athenian that while praying is fine, he must also ""move his arms.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that divine help or outside assistance is not a substitute for personal exertion. This is a classic retelling of the proverb ""God helps those who help themselves.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Self-effort is essential:** This directly aligns with the advice to ""move your arms"" while praying. It emphasizes that one must work toward their own salvation or goals rather than relying solely on external forces.
*   **B) A learned man has always a fund of riches in himself:** This is the moral of a different Aesop fable (*Simonides*), focusing on wisdom over material wealth.
*   **C) True power lies in practicality:** While the advice is practical, ""self-effort"" is a more precise description of the requirement to act physically to survive.
*   **D) Powerful opposites are utterly divine and incompatible:** This does not fit the context of the story.
*   **E) True character is revealed when the tides turn:** The story focuses more on the necessity of action than on moral character or integrity.

The traditional moral associated with this Aesop's fable (*The Shipwrecked Man*) is ""Along with Athena, move your hands,"" which translates most accurately to the necessity of self-effort.

1.  **The Conflict:** The Frog and the Mouse are so focused on their internal rivalry for ""sovereignty"" that they engage in a formal, ""to the death"" combat.
2.  **The Distraction:** Their intense focus on defeating one another makes them oblivious to their surroundings.
3.  **The Resolution:** Because they are preoccupied with their fight, they become easy targets for a third party (the Kite).
4.  **The Result:** A third party benefits from the exhaustion or distraction of the combatants, and the original combatants lose everything.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) When fools fight others run away with the prize:** This is a classic interpretation of the fable. While the Frog and Mouse were busy fighting over the ""prize"" (the marsh), the Kite took the actual ""prize"" (the combatants themselves as food).
*   **B) People who do harm to others destroy themselves:** While true, this focuses more on malice than the situational irony of a third-party predator.
*   **C) Stay vigilant:** This is an applicable lesson, but usually, fables about combatants being snatched up focus on the futility of their specific quarrel.
*   **D) Be observant before you leap:** This applies more to the Kite, who was already successful.
*   **E) Rivalries can blind us to the greater dangers lurking nearby:** This accurately describes the psychological state of the Frog and Mouse.

In most classical collections of Aesop's Fables (where this story originates), the standard moral emphasizes that when two parties fight over a grievance, a third party often steps in to profit from their ruin. Option A captures the essence of the ""third party profiting"" (the Kite getting an easy meal), which is the traditional lesson of ""The Frog and the Mouse.""

The surviving daughter wondered to see strangers so much concerned at the loss of her sister, and he",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the narrative:

1.  **The Context:** A family has lost a child. They hire ""mourners"" (professionals) to attend the funeral.
2.  **The Observation:** The surviving daughter notices that these strangers are weeping and showing more outward concern than the actual family members.
3.  **The Explanation:** The mother explains that the family gains nothing from the act of crying, but the strangers are expressive because they are being **paid**.

**Analysis:**
The story highlights the difference between genuine emotion and performative emotion. The ""mourners"" are not crying out of grief, but because it is their job. Their loyalty and their displays of emotion are transactional. This fable (often attributed to Aesop) is intended to show that outward displays of sentiment can be bought and are often insincere compared to the quiet, practical reality of those actually affected.

*   **A** accurately reflects the mother's explanation: the strangers' behavior is dictated by payment.
*   **B** is a general platitude not supported by the mother's cynical explanation.
*   **C** describes the daughter's behavior but is not the ""lesson"" of the interaction.
*   **D** is too complex; there is no suggestion that the daughter or mother has ""compromised their integrity,"" but rather that the mother is being brutally honest about the business of mourning.
*   **E** is contradicted by the text, which explicitly states the strangers are not sharing sorrow, but are being paid.

Therefore, the story teaches a cynical lesson about mercenary motives.

1.  **The Characters:** We have a traveler and a personification of ""Truth.""
2.  **The Conflict:** Truth is depicted as ""dejected"" and living in isolation in the wilderness.
3.  **The Dialogue:** When the traveler asks why Truth has left the city (civilization) for the desert, Truth explains that in the past, lies were rare (""found among only a few""). However, in the present, lies ""have spread throughout all of human society.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that Truth no longer has a place in human society because honesty has been replaced by universal falsehood. Truth is forced into the desert because there is no room for her among men.

Evaluating the options:

As the ox stru",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Situation:** A donkey and an ox are tasked with pulling a heavy load together (sharing a burden).
2.  **The Conflict:** The donkey refuses to help, leaving the injured ox to do all the work alone.
3.  **The Consequence (Phase 1):** The ox dies from the strain of carrying the entire load.
4.  **The Consequence (Phase 2):** Because the ox is dead, the donkey is forced to carry not only the original load but also the heavy carcass of the ox. This leads to the donkey's own death.
5.  **The Lesson:** The birds explicitly state that if the donkey had helped his neighbor (the ox), he would have survived.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the cause-and-effect of the story: by failing to help a ""neighbor"" (the ox), the donkey inherited the ox's entire burden, leading to his downfall.
*   **B:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific lesson about cooperation and mutual aid.
*   **C:** Hard work did not triumph in this story; both characters died.
*   **D:** ""Unhelpful burdens"" is a vague phrasing that doesn't capture the moral imperative of helping others.
*   **E:** While the ox showed perseverance, the story is primarily a warning to the donkey about the risks of selfishness.

The story teaches that selfishness in a shared task is self-defeating because when your partner fails, their portion of the struggle (and more) becomes yours.

1.  **Summary of the Narrative:** The fable explains how modesty was added to human nature after man had already been created. Because it was an afterthought, it was released into the world rather than being built into each individual.
2.  **The Specific Condition:** When Modesty agrees to join humanity, she sets one explicit condition: that she cannot exist in the same space as ""carnal love"" (physical/sexual desire).
3.  **The Final Proclamation:** The character of Modesty explicitly states, ""wherever that [carnal love] comes... I'm gone."" This indicates a fundamental incompatibility between the two.
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A) Modesty and carnal love cannot survive together:** This directly mirrors the conclusion of the text.
    *   **B) We must not require what is unreasonable:** The text does not focus on the reasonableness of requests.
    *   **C) Haste can lead to unwelcome outcomes:** While haste is mentioned as the reason modesty was forgotten, the primary lesson of the fable focuses on the relationship between modesty and love.
    *   **D) Do not unmodestly mock...:** This is the moral for a different fable (the Old Man and Death or similar).
    *   **E) Virtues shared are virtues gained:** The text does not advocate for sharing virtues in this manner.

**Conclusion:** The central point of the fable is the mutual exclusivity of modesty and carnal love as defined in the narrative.

The fox then said to ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of this story, let's look at the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Situation:** A monkey and a fox are walking through a cemetery.
2.  **The Deception:** The monkey claims the dead people buried there were his ancestors' freedmen (slaves who were granted freedom). This is a grand, unverifiable boast intended to make himself seem more important and noble.
3.  **The Fox's Insight:** The fox points out that the monkey chose this specific location to tell his lie because the dead cannot speak up to object or prove him wrong. Because there are no witnesses available to contradict the monkey, he feels safe in his exaggeration.

Looking at the options:
*   **B, D, and E** deal with loyalty, getting into ""deep water,"" or shared paths, which are not the primary focus of the fox's observation.
*   **C** says cunning words mask deception, which is true, but it doesn't capture the specific context of the cemetery.
*   **A** states that ""Deceivers often exploit the inability of others to challenge their falsehoods."" This perfectly matches the fox's point: the monkey is lying precisely because the subjects of his lies (the dead) are incapable of refuting him.

The fable teaches that boastful people often choose to lie about things that cannot be verified or about people who cannot defend the truth.

The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural i",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Action:** A Farmer performs an act of pure kindness (mercy/compassion) toward a creature in distress (the Snake).
2.  **The Reaction:** Once the Snake is revived and out of danger, it follows its ""natural instincts"" and bites the Farmer, killing him.
3.  **The Realization:** The Farmer realizes that his kindness was misplaced because the nature of the recipient was ""scoundrelly"" or inherently harmful.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that no matter how much kindness or help you offer to someone who is fundamentally wicked or ungrateful, their nature will not change, and they may still harm you.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful:** This perfectly matches the narrative. The Farmer's kindness (saving the snake's life) did not stop the snake from acting on its harmful nature.
*   **B) The man who treats others well is rewarded by gratitude:** The story proves the opposite of this.
*   **C) Gratitude prevents regret:** This does not apply, as there was no gratitude present. 
*   **D) Injuries may be regretfully forgiven, but not ungratefully forgotten:** This focuses on moving past an injury, whereas the story is about the danger of misplaced kindness.
*   **E) Even in the coldest times, a touch of compassion can revive what seems lost:** While literally true in the story, it ignores the fatal consequence, which is the actual ""point"" of Aesop's fables.

Therefore, the traditional moral is that the wicked do not change their nature simply because they have been shown mercy.

When the blacksmiths were working, the dog would go to sleep, but when they sat down to a meal he would wake up and approach his masters in a f",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the behavior of the dog in the fable:

1.  **The Situation:** The dog ignores the loud, productive work of the blacksmiths (the heavy hammers). This indicates that the dog is indifferent to the labor or the industry occurring in the household.
2.  **The Change:** As soon as the sound of eating begins—a sound much quieter than a hammer—the dog wakes up and becomes attentive.
3.  **The Lesson:** The contrast highlights that the dog’s attention is governed entirely by self-interest. He sleeps through the ""hard work"" because it doesn't benefit him, but he is instantly alert for ""rewards"" (food).

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A)** This directly addresses the contrast between ignoring what doesn't concern the individual (the work/hammers) and noticing what benefits them (the food/chewing).
*   **B)** This pertains to delegated actions, which is irrelevant here.
*   **C)** While the story shows the dog is not diligent, the primary focus is on his selective perception/opportunism rather than a triumph of diligence.
*   **D)** There is no ""tyrant"" in this story, only a lazy dog.
*   **E)** There is no ""harmony"" being created; the dog is simply waiting for a handout.

Option A perfectly describes the behavior of someone who is oblivious to communal effort but hyper-aware of personal gain.

He greeted the unicorn and said to him, 'Let us put aside all that we have done in the past, because I am no ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the dialogue:

1.  **The Conflict:** The lion and the unicorn are chief enemies.
2.  **The Deception:** The lion feigns illness and weakness to lower the unicorn's guard, specifically asking for the unicorn's weapon (his horn) under the guise of needing a walking stick.
3.  **The Mistake:** The unicorn pities his enemy and hands over his only means of defense, leaving himself vulnerable.
4.  **The Betrayal:** The lion immediately uses the advantage to attack the defenseless unicorn.
5.  **The Argument:** The unicorn laments the treachery, while the lion argues that showing mercy to an enemy is a weakness. The unicorn concludes that a victory won through guile is not an honorable victory.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A** captures the primary cautionary lesson: The unicorn’s fatal error was trusting a known enemy who appeared humble and supplicating. The story warns that an enemy's nature doesn't change just because they appear weak.
*   **B** is incorrect as the unicorn was not ""bragging.""
*   **C** is a general truth, but not as specific to the ""enemy"" dynamic emphasized in the text.
*   **D** is a corruption of the Golden Rule and does not fit the lesson.
*   **E** reflects the unicorn’s final sentiment, but the *fable's* primary function (like most Aesopic fables regarding predators and prey) is a warning about survival and the folly of trusting those who wish you harm.

While the unicorn gets the last word about honor, the practical lesson (the ""moral"") of the narrative action is that one should never disarm themselves or trust the honeyed words of a foe.

But being the ruler of the freshwater wasn't enough for him; he wanted to rule the sea too. With t",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** The Master-Pike is already a ""Prince"" in his own domain (the river). He possesses size, beauty, and strength relative to his environment.
2.  **The Conflict:** He becomes dissatisfied with his status and seeks to expand his rule to a domain (the sea) where he does not belong and is not the strongest.
3.  **The Consequence:** He encounters a much stronger creature (the Dolphin) and is nearly killed, forced to flee back to his original home.
4.  **The Resolution:** He learns to stay within his own territory, accepting his role as the ruler of the river rather than seeking more.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Be content with your lot:** This fits perfectly. The Pike had a good life as the ""Prince of the River"" but risked everything because he wasn't satisfied with what he had.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you:** The story focuses on the Pike's ambition and the physical reality of the Dolphin's strength, not social reputation.
*   **C) Strength without humility invites downfall:** While true, the story specifically emphasizes territory and being satisfied with one's own sphere of influence.
*   **D) Ambitious counsel without mighty help is useless:** The Pike acted on his own ambition, not ""counsel"" from others.
*   **E) True leadership is not just about appearance:** Though the Pike had appearance, the story's focus is on the boundary between his domain and the ocean, not his leadership style.

The primary lesson is that the Pike should have been satisfied with his successful life in the river instead of overreaching into a dangerous, unfamiliar territory.

1.  **The Conflict:** Two soldiers are faced with a robber. One flees (cowardice) while the other stays to fight (bravery).
2.  **The Aftermath:** Once the danger has passed, the soldier who ran away returns, drawing his sword and making aggressive, boastful claims about how he would have handled the robber.
3.  **The Rebuttal:** The brave soldier rebukes him, pointing out that words are meaningless now because his actions (running away) proved his lack of courage. He notes that while the coward might fool strangers with his talk, those who have seen his actions know he is unreliable.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Courage in words means nothing if you flee in danger:** This directly addresses the contrast between the soldier's boastful speech and his actual behavior during the crisis.
*   **B) There is little risk in being poor...:** This is irrelevant to the themes of bravery and cowardice presented.
*   **C) Bravery outshines cowardice:** While true, it is a general statement that doesn't capture the specific irony of the coward’s boastful words after the fact.
*   **D) Know your aggressive, unreliable enemies:** The coward is a companion/comrade, not the primary enemy (the robber).
*   **E) Courage in adversity reveals true character:** This is a strong theme, but the core of this specific fable (from Aesop/Phaedrus) focuses on the ""braggart"" who acts tough only after the danger is gone. 

Option A most accurately reflects the specific lesson taught by the brave soldier's response to his companion's empty boasts.

1.  **The Situation:** The Hoopoe is given a seat of honor at a wedding, placing it above all the other birds.
2.  **The Reason for Honor:** The Hoopoe is chosen for its outward beauty—specifically its crown and its multicolored feathers.
3.  **The Reality of the Subject:** Despite its beautiful appearance, the Hoopoe’s actual behavior and habits are ""rolling around in dung and filth.""
4.  **The Conflict:** The other birds resent this because the outward appearance (the ""crown"") does not align with the creature's true nature or lifestyle.

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) True worth should be measured by character and deeds, not by outward appearances.** This fits perfectly. The Hoopoe is honored for its shallow, physical beauty while its actual character (spending time in filth) is ignored.
*   **B) It is very unwise... to provoke the least.** This is the moral of ""The Eagle and the Beetle,"" not this story.
*   **C) Resentment tarnishes celebration.** While the birds are resentful, the focus of the fable is on *why* they are resentful: the unearned status given to the Hoopoe.
*   **D) Notable kindness is never honored wasted.** This is the moral of ""The Lion and the Mouse"" and does not apply here.
*   **E) Inclusivity strengthens community bonds.** The story describes a division/resentment, not a lesson on inclusivity.

The fable teaches that just because someone looks royal or impressive on the outside, it doesn't mean their habits or character merit honor.

They w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A hen finds snake eggs and decides to care for them as if they were her own, brooding on them to hatch them. This represents an act of misplaced kindness or nurturing toward something inherently dangerous.
2.  **The Warning:** A swallow observes this and calls the hen ""stupid"" and ""senseless.""
3.  **The Consequence:** The swallow predicts that once the snakes hatch, their nature will not be changed by the hen's care. Instead, they will act according to their predatory nature and destroy the hen first, then others.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that the inherent nature of a ""wicked"" or dangerous entity does not change simply because you treat it with kindness. Helping a dangerous enemy grow stronger only ensures your own eventual destruction.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the lesson: a ""wicked man"" (the snake) remains dangerous even if they seem ""innocuous"" (the egg/helpless hatchling), and trusting/nurturing them is a fatal mistake.
*   **B)** This refers to greed, which is not the theme here. (Commonly the moral of ""The Dog and the Shadow"").
*   **C)** The story suggests the opposite—that the hen's devotion invites danger rather than averting it.
*   **D)** This refers to hubris or ""The Frog and the Ox,"" which is not the theme here.
*   **E)** While the hen attempts this, the fable warns that doing so is foolish and suicidal, not a positive transcendence.

The fable, attributed to Aesop (The Hen and the Snake), is a classic warning against harborng or helping those who are naturally inclined to harm you.

The jackdaw, however, could not stand to live in human society, so w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the jackdaw's realization:

1.  **The Situation:** The jackdaw is captured by a human to be a pet (a slave) for children.
2.  **The Conflict:** The bird values his freedom above all else and cannot tolerate living in human society.
3.  **The Action:** He seizes a moment of freedom to fly back to his nest.
4.  **The Catastrophe:** Because the string is still tied to his leg, he becomes entangled in the branches of his own home. He cannot fly and eventually faces death.
5.  **The Realization:** In his final moments, the bird recognizes his own error. By obsessing over his lack of freedom in human society and rushing into a situation that proved fatal, he essentially traded a life he disliked for no life at all.

**Evaluating the options:**
- **A)** Matches the standard interpretation of Aesop's fables concerning this story (often titled ""The Jackdaw and the String""). It suggests that our internal reaction to our circumstances (the bird's ""mind"") and his refusal to tolerate his condition led to his demise. However, it specifically addresses the theme that the quest for freedom at any cost can lead to a worse fate.
- **B), C), and D)** These do not relate to the plot of the jackdaw.
- **E)** While the jackdaw did not appreciate the ""gift"" of the home because he lacked freedom, the story's climax is about the fatal consequence of his escape, not just his lack of appreciation.

In classical literature, this fable is categorized under the idea that in seeking to escape one trouble, we often fall into a far worse one, or that our own perceptions of what is ""unbearable"" can lead us to ruin. Option A captures the philosophical root that the bird's inability to reconcile his mind with his condition (as a pet) led to his death.

'Be careful, my friends,' he said, 'what if we all drown before the me",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of sailors is in a life-threatening storm.
2.  **The Conflict:** The sailors are attempting to seek help by praying to various intermediaries (saints).
3.  **The Reasoning:** The observant sailor points out a practical flaw: using intermediaries takes time and risks the ""message"" not arriving before they perish. He suggests bypassing the middlemen and going straight to the source of power (God).
4.  **The Outcome:** By praying directly to the source, their request is heard and the storm is calmed immediately.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the sailor’s logic. By going directly to the ""one who can save us without any help,"" they chose the most efficient and direct route to a solution.
*   **B:** There is no evidence of a ""love vs. fear"" dynamic in the text.
*   **C:** While the sea calms (mercy), the focus of the sailor’s dialogue is on the efficiency of the prayer, not the nature of the power itself.
*   **D:** The advice given *was* pragmatic and wise, so this contradicts the story.
*   **E:** While urgency is mentioned, the story is specifically about the *method* of communication (direct vs. indirect) rather than just the speed of it.

The fable teaches that when a situation is dire or an objective is important, it is best to go directly to the person in charge rather than relying on intermediaries. This is a classic Aesopic moral.

1.  **The Conflict:** Two predators (the snake and the weasel) are fighting. Both are natural enemies of the mice.
2.  **The Misinterpretation:** The mice observe their enemies busy with each other. They interpret this conflict as a moment of safety or an opportunity to roam freely without danger.
3.  **The Action:** The mice leave the safety of their holes, becoming vulnerable and visible.
4.  **The Consequence:** The predators realize there is easier prey available. They set aside their mutual grievance to capitalize on the vulnerability of the mice.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This is the most accurate reflection of the story. The ""powerful parties"" (predators) were in conflict, and the ""bystanders"" (mice) suffered because they misjudged the situation and became the target once the predators found common interest in hunting them.
*   **B, C, and E:** These do not align with the specific plot points of predators teaming up against prey.
*   **D:** While this sounds like a traditional moral (often associated with Aesop's fables), it is overly complex and specifically addresses ""fierce peace."" The core lesson of this specific fable is that when two strong enemies are fighting, the weak should not assume they are safe to come out of hiding, as the enemies may unite against them.

The mice were ""caught in the middle"" not because of the fight itself, but because they assumed the fight made them safe. Their presence as bystanders led to their downfall once the powerful entities noticed them.

1.  **The Situation:** The Goldfinch has escaped a cage where it was well-fed and ""cared for"" by a human.
2.  **The Conflict:** The Master argues that the bird will be worse off because it won't receive the same level of comfort or safety in the wild.
3.  **The Resolution/Lesson:** The Goldfinch acknowledges that life might be harder or less luxurious on its own, but explicitly states that independence and self-governance are preferable to being ""cared for"" in captivity.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) There is no wealth greater than liberty.** This fits perfectly. The bird suggests that the ""wealth"" of care and food provided by the Master is worth less than the freedom to take care of itself.
*   **B) Dealing with good/bad people.** The story is not about the character of the Master, but about the state of being in a cage versus being free.
*   **C) Defiance and concern.** This interprets the Boy's words as concern, but the core of the fable is the bird's retort regarding its own freedom.
*   **D) Independent location and mind.** This is a philosophical statement about internal state, but the fable focuses on the external value of liberty over comfort.
*   **E) Freedom is worth pursuing at great risk.** While similar to A, the text focuses on the trade-off between **care/provision** (wealth/comfort) and **autonomy** (liberty). Option A more accurately captures the trade-off presented in the dialogue.

The primary theme is that the comfort of a ""gilded cage"" does not compensate for the loss of autonomy.

1.  **The Donkey and the Monkey:** Both characters are complaining about lacking ""cosmetic"" or non-essential physical features (horns for a donkey, a tail for a monkey). These are relatively minor inconveniences or perceived deficiencies.
2.  **The Mole:** The mole interrupts them to point out a much more significant hardship: the lack of sight (""deprived of eyes""). 
3.  **The Interaction:** By highlighting a greater misfortune, the mole illustrates that the grievances of the donkey and the monkey are trivial by comparison. The lesson is intended to make the complainers realize they are actually quite fortunate compared to others.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** Directly aligns with the story’s theme of gaining perspective on one's own misfortunes by observing the greater misfortunes of others.
*   **B:** Relates to mutual aid/cooperation (often the moral of the fable ""The Donkey and the Ox""), which is not present here.
*   **C:** While true in reality, it isn't the specific point the mole is making; the mole is addressing the *relative severity* of the complaints.
*   **D:** This suggests a karmic retribution that is not present in the text.
*   **E:** This focuses on ""unique gifts,"" but the story focuses on physical deprivation and perspective.

The story teaches that we should be more grateful or patient regarding our own situation when we realize that others have far heavier burdens to bear.

morables_42,"A Fox invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his entertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out into a broad flat stone dish. The soup fell out of the long bill of the Cra",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The Fox plays a trick on the Crane by serving food in a flat dish that the Crane cannot use. The Fox enjoys the Crane's frustration. This is an act of unkindness and trickery.
2.  **The Crane's Reaction:** Instead of simply being a victim, the Crane replicates the behavior of the Fox. He serves the Fox in a vessel that only a Crane can use.
3.  **The Result:** The Fox is unable to eat and realizes that she is being treated exactly how she treated the Crane (""fitting requital""). 

**Evaluating the options:**
- **A) Do unto others what you would have them do unto you:** This is the ""Golden Rule."" The story illustrates the consequence of *ignoring* this rule. Because the Fox treated the Crane poorly, the Crane treated the Fox poorly in return. This is the classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable (often stated as ""One bad turn deserves another"" or ""Treat others as you wish to be treated"").
- **B) Beware the sort of person who uses tricks:** While the Fox is a trickster, the story focuses more on the reciprocity of the behavior rather than a general warning to stay away from such people.
- **C) Cleverness can outwit vexation:** This is too vague.
- **D) A clever alliance with the powerless is futile:** This does not fit the context.
- **E) Consideration for others' needs fosters true hospitality:** While true in a general sense, the story focuses on the *punishment* or *retaliation* resulting from the lack of consideration, leading back to the principle of reciprocity found in option A.

The Fox's ""fitting requital"" teaches that if you treat others poorly, you should expect to be treated poorly in return. Therefore, you should do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the persons in her father's house, he made some excuse to send her home o",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A man notices his wife is disliked by everyone in his household. He sends her to her father’s house to see if her behavior causes the same reaction elsewhere.
2.  **The Evidence:** Upon her return, the wife complains that even the shepherds and herdsmen—people who are busy outside with their flocks from dawn until dusk—treated her with aversion.
3.  **The Conclusion:** The husband deduces that if people who barely saw her (only at the very beginning and end of the day) disliked her, then those who had to spend the entire day with her must have found her unbearable.
4.  **The Lesson:** Small signs or interactions (the ""straws"") indicate a much larger, pervasive problem (the ""wind""). If a brief encounter results in dislike, it is a clear indicator of how she is perceived during longer interactions.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A) Straws show how the wind blows:** This is a classic idiom meaning that small signs show the direction of a larger trend or character. In this case, the shepherds' brief dislike is the ""straw"" that proves the ""wind"" of her generally disagreeable nature.
- **B, C, D, E:** While some touch on themes of household harmony or observation, they do not capture the logical deduction the husband makes regarding the small signs indicating a larger truth.

This fable is traditionally attributed to Aesop, and the standard moral associated with it in many collections is ""Straws show how the wind blows.""

morables_693,"The coachman, hearing one of the wheels of his coach creak, was surprised; but more especially when he perceived that it was the worst wheel of the whole set, and which he thought had but little prete",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the fable step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation:** A coachman hears a wheel creaking.
2.  **The Observation:** He notices that the wheel making the noise is the ""worst wheel of the whole set.""
3.  **The Interpretation:** The coachman is surprised because he feels the weak/bad wheel has ""little pretense to take such a liberty"" (meaning it shouldn't be complaining or drawing attention to itself since it is already failing to do its job well).
4.  **The Underlying Lesson:** In literature and fables (similar to those by Aesop), the ""creaking wheel"" is often a metaphor for those who complain the loudest despite being the most flawed or burdensome. It suggests that those who do the least work or have the most issues are often the ones who make the most noise or cause the most trouble.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Complaining is the privilege of the weak:** This aligns with the idea that the ""worst"" part of the group is the one making the noise. It is often cited as the traditional moral for this specific fable (The Creaking Wheel).
*   **B, C, D:** These do not relate to the specific interaction between the coachman and the failing wheel.
*   **E) Noise often masks vulnerability:** While plausible, the fable focuses more on the *audacity* of the weak part complaining, rather than a strategy of masking.

In traditional collections of fables, this story highlights that those who are most inefficient or troublesome are often the ones who complain the loudest.

morables_612,"There was a woman of Sybaris who broke a jar. The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, 'I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you'd gone right",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the woman's reaction:

1.  **The Event:** A woman breaks a jar.
2.  **The Logic of the Jar (the victim):** The jar (personified or representing a witness-driven culture) seeks legal restitution or public acknowledgment of the wrong done by finding a witness and preparing a court case.
3.  **The Woman's Critique:** The woman points out the absurdity of seeking a lawyer or a witness for a broken object. Instead of litigating the past or arguing about the breakage, the ""wise"" thing to do would have been to fix the problem immediately (getting a ""bandage"" to repair it).

**Step-by-step analysis:**
*   **A) Action is more valuable than arguments:** This fits well. The woman suggests that repairing the damage (action) is far better than litigating/testifying about it (arguments/legal proceedings).
*   **B) You can't please everybody:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C) Practicality triumphs over sarcasm:** While the woman is being sarcastic, her point is that the jar's choice (litigation) was impractical. However, the fable is traditionally used to illustrate that solving a problem is better than talking about it.
*   **D) Practical fortune...:** This is an overly complex interpretation that doesn't fit the simplicity of an Aesopic fable.
*   **E) Small actions can reveal hidden strengths:** The story focuses on the futility of the court case versus the utility of the bandage, not on hidden strengths.

The core of the fable is about focusing on a remedy (a practical action) rather than seeking blame or legal victory through words and witnesses. This is a classic theme in Greek fables (often attributed to Aesop) where ""deeds are better than words"" or ""remedies are better than complaints.""

The most accurate distillation is that taking practical action to solve a problem is superior to arguing about how it happened or seeking witnesses for it.

morables_506,"The dolphins and Whales waged a fierce war with each other. When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict**: Two powerful, large sea creatures (Dolphins and Whales) are engaged in a fierce war.
2.  **The Intervener**: A Sprat (a very small, insignificant fish) offers to act as a mediator or umpire to settle the dispute.
3.  **The Reaction**: The Dolphin rejects the offer with contempt. The message is that the powerful combatants find the idea of an insignificant creature interfering in their ""grand"" affairs so insulting that they would rather die fighting each other than accept help from someone they deem inferior.
4.  **The Lesson**: The core of the story focuses on the pride and arrogance of the combatants. Even in the face of destruction, their vanity prevents them from accepting a sensible solution if it comes from a source they consider beneath them.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** is close but focuses on the act of fighting rather than the reason for rejecting the peace.
*   **B** is about adaptation, which isn't present here.
*   **C** (**Pride often leads to unnecessary conflict**) or its variations in classical Aesop translations (often phrased as ""Some men of no consequence... think themselves of great importance when caught up in the affairs of the great"") highlights that the ""great"" would rather perish than lose dignity.
*   **D** isn't a standard moral.
*   **E** describes the situation (mutual ruin) but misses the specific punchline regarding the Sprat.

In traditional interpretations of this Aesop fable, the moral is centered on the idea that insignificant people who try to interfere in the affairs of the ""great"" are often held in contempt, or that the pride of the powerful is such that they despise help from the humble. However, looking at the provided options in the context of standard literary analysis of this specific fable, the pride of the combatants is the driving force. 

While C is a strong thematic fit, the fable is often categorized under the idea that the ""insignificant"" mediator is the one being rebuked for their vanity, or conversely, that the combatants would rather perish than be mediated by someone ""unworthy."" Among the choices provided, **C** best captures the internal defect (pride) that sustains the conflict.

One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them. When th",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"In many of Aesop's fables, the behavior of characters serves as a metaphor for human integrity and consistency. 

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1. **The Action:** The Man uses the same action (blowing breath) for two opposite purposes: warming his hands and cooling his food.
2. **The Satyr's Reaction:** The Satyr, a creature of nature, perceives this inconsistency as a sign of duplicity or ""double-tongued"" behavior. He concludes that if a person can produce two opposite effects from the same source, they are inconsistent and therefore untrustworthy.
3. **The Symbolic Meaning:** Historically, the phrase ""to blow hot and cold"" has become an idiom describing a person who frequently changes their mind or supports opposing sides of an issue depending on the circumstances.
4. **Evaluating the Options:**
   - **A** directly addresses the idea of inconsistency and double-dealing, which is the traditional moral of this specific fable.
   - **B** refers to a different group of fables (like King Midas).
   - **C** interprets the man's actions positively, but the story's ending (the Satyr's rejection) clearly frames the behavior as a negative trait.
   - **D** is overly complex and does not fit the context of the interaction.
   - **E** is a general moral, but A is the specific lesson intended by the Satyr's judgment of the Man's inconsistent nature.

The moral is that those who are inconsistent or who try to please or represent opposing sides are unreliable.

1.  **The Setting:** Socrates builds a ""modest"" or ""tiny"" house.
2.  **The Question:** A neighbor asks why a man of his stature would live in such a small space, implying that a great man should have a large house to accommodate many people or signify his status.
3.  **Socrates' Response:** ""If only I could fill it with true friends!"" 
4.  **The Meaning:** Socrates is implying that even a tiny house is difficult to fill because ""true friends"" are so rare. If he actually had enough true friends to fill even a small room, he would consider himself lucky. The size of the house is irrelevant; the difficulty lies in finding genuine companionship.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) True friends are hard to find:** This directly aligns with Socrates’ witty remark about the difficulty of filling even a small space with true friends.
*   **B) Guilty conscience:** This is unrelated to the text.
*   **C) Curiosity fuels wisdom:** While the neighbor is curious, the point of the story is the answer given, not the act of asking.
*   **D) Modest, philosophical wise man:** This is a meta-commentary on the narrator's intro, but not the moral of the fable itself.
*   **E) True greatness requires enduring hardships:** While the narrator mentions dying like Socrates, the core of the specific ""house"" anecdote is about friendship.

The fable (attributed to Phaedrus) is a classic illustration of the scarcity of genuine friendship.

Admittedly, Prometheus had made the lion very large and handsome, supplying him with sharp fangs in his jaw and arming him w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the progression of the lion's feelings:

1.  **Initial State:** Despite being the most powerful creature, the lion is fixated on his single weakness (a fear of roosters) to the point of suicidal despair and self-loathing.
2.  **The Interaction:** He meets the elephant, another massive and powerful creature, and discovers that the elephant is terrified of something as tiny and insignificant as a gnat.
3.  **The Realization:** The lion realizes that even the mightiest creatures have vulnerabilities. He concludes that his situation is actually better than the elephant's, because a rooster is at least more substantial than a gnat.
4.  **The Shift:** His perspective shifts from ""I am a failure because I have a weakness"" to ""I am an excellent creature because everyone has weaknesses, and mine is less bothersome than others'.""

Looking at the options:
*   **A) There is always someone else worse off than you:** This fits the lion’s conclusion. By seeing the elephant’s struggle with a ""lesser"" threat (the gnat), the lion gains perspective on his own struggle and feels better about his life.
*   **B) No matter how you brag, you can be undone:** The lion wasn't bragging; he was lamenting.
*   **C) Strength alone does not guarantee invulnerability:** While true in the story, the lion's takeaway is not about caution or vulnerability, but about finding comfort/perspective in the universality of flaws.
*   **D) You may share the labours...:** This refers to a completely different fable (The Lion's Share).
*   **E) Even divine gifts can spark envy:** The lion wasn't envious of others; he was dissatisfied with himself until he saw another's struggle.

The core lesson is about gaining perspective on one's own misfortunes or flaws by observing others.

morables_169,"The crow was making a sacrifice to Athena and invited a dog to the feast. The dog said to her, 'Why do you foolishly squander these sacrifices? The goddess clearly hates you so much that she has taken",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the fable step by step:

1.  **The Context:** The crow is performing a religious sacrifice to Athena despite the dog pointing out that Athena seemingly dislikes the crow (evidenced by the fact that the crow's omens are no longer believed by humans).
2.  **The Conflict:** The dog views the sacrifice as a waste of resources (""squander[ing]"") because the relationship between the crow and the goddess is already broken.
3.  **The Resolution:** The crow explains that she is sacrificing precisely *because* the relationship is bad. Her goal is to appease an enemy or a hostile power to improve her own situation or regain her lost status.
4.  **The Lesson:** The crow is not acting out of pure piety, but out of a calculated effort to win over someone who is currently against her. In traditional collections of Aesop's fables, this story (Perry Index 128) is often used to illustrate how people try to buy the favor of those who dislike them or are hostile to them.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** aligns with the crow's logic: she is ""treating her enemy well"" (making a sacrifice to a goddess who hates her) in hopes of ""gaining something"" (the return of her credibility/omens).
*   **B, C, D, and E** do not fit the specific transactional and strategic nature of the crow’s response to the dog's cynicism.

The story goes that when a male hyena was treating a female badly, she said to him",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"In this fable, derived from Aesop, the core message centers on the reversal of roles and the consequences of mistreatment.

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1.  **The Premise:** The fable relies on the (fictional) belief that the hyena changes sex periodically. This means that an individual in a position of power or a specific role (the male) will eventually inhabit the subordinate or opposite role (the female).
2.  **The Conflict:** The male hyena treats the female badly, exerting dominance while he holds the ""superior"" position in that specific timeframe.
3.  **The Warning:** The female hyena warns the male that their positions will swap. Her message is: do not mistreat someone today, because tomorrow you will be in their position, and they will be in yours.
4.  **The Moral Application:** This is a classic ""the tables will turn"" lesson. It warns those in power or those acting as ""masters/teachers"" to treat their subordinates with respect, as the social or power hierarchy is fluid.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Captures the essence of role reversal (those being judged/ruled over becoming the judge/ruler later). In many translations of this fable (Perry Index 242), the moral is specifically summarized as: ""If you are in office, do not behave tyrannically, for you will soon be a private citizen yourself."" This aligns with the transition from the ""judged"" to the ""judge.""
*   **B & C:** These are common morals for other fables (like The Fox and the Crow or The Tortoise and the Hare) but don't fit the cyclical nature of this story.
*   **D:** Focuses on mistrust, but the story is more about a warning of future retribution.
*   **E:** This is a modern self-help interpretation that ignores the warning/threat inherent in the female hyena's words.

Option **A** is the most accurate representation of the ""tables turning"" theme found in traditional interpretations of this fable.

The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the source of the conflict:

1.  **The Alliance:** The lion and the dolphin form an alliance based on their status (kings of their respective realms).
2.  **The Conflict:** The lion enters a battle on land (against the wild bull) and requires physical assistance.
3.  **The Failure:** Despite his willingness to help, the dolphin is physically incapable of leaving the water to fight on land.
4.  **The Accusation:** The lion feels betrayed because his ally did not help him in his moment of need.
5.  **The Lesson:** The dolphin points out that his nature (being a sea creature) makes it impossible for him to assist on land.

The story teaches that while two parties may have mutual respect or shared status, an alliance is only practical if the parties are actually capable of supporting one another in times of need. A land creature and a sea creature cannot assist each other in their respective environments, making their alliance ineffective in moments of peril.

*   **A** directly addresses the inability of the ally to provide aid during a crisis due to nature/circumstance.
*   **B** is incorrect because the dolphin did not *want* to betray the lion; he was simply unable to help.
*   **C** focuses on the adversaries rather than the failure of the alliance.
*   **D** is a general statement about effort that doesn't fit the specific failure of the story.
*   **E** is a possible modern interpretation, but **A** is the traditional moral associated with Aesop's fables, focusing on the practical utility of allies.

1.  **The Situation:** A fox attempts to trick a cicada into coming down from a tree by using flattery, intending to eat him.
2.  **The Response:** The cicada is not fooled. Instead of coming down, he tests the fox by dropping a leaf to confirm the fox's predatory intent.
3.  **The Reasoning:** The cicada explicitly states why he is so cautious: he saw the wings of another cicada in a fox's droppings (spoor).
4.  **The Lesson:** The cicada learned to be wary and protect himself by observing the misfortune (death) of another cicada at the hands of a fox. He used the experience of others to avoid the same fate.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the cicada's statement. He became ""wise"" (discerning) by observing what happened to his ""neighbor"" (the other cicada).
*   **B:** There is no mention of divine judgment.
*   **C:** While trickery is present, the focus is on the cicada's wisdom in avoiding it, not the breeding of more deception.
*   **D:** This suggests a self-fulfilling prophecy, but the cicada actually avoids his fate through his caution.
*   **E:** This is a plausible observation about the fox, but the ""moral"" of Aesop-style fables usually focuses on the wisdom gained by the survivor.

The most accurate moral, based on the cicada's final speech, is that a wise person learns from the mistakes or misfortunes of others.

1.  **The Context:** The Mother Goat warns her Kid to stay inside and only open the door to her, emphasizing caution against outsiders.
2.  **The Conflict:** The Wolf attempts to deceive the Kid by mimicking the Mother Goat’s voice (the ""hypocrisy"" or ""counterfeit"").
3.  **The Resolution:** The Kid does not rely solely on the sound of the voice but uses his eyes to inspect the visitor. He recognizes the wolf despite the imitation.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Wolf is a hypocrite (pretending to be something he is not to achieve a malicious end), but his true nature is revealed upon closer inspection. The story teaches that false appearances and deceptive words can be uncovered by those who are vigilant.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) A hypocrite can usually be found out.** This directly addresses the Wolf's attempt to fake an identity and the Kid's success in seeing through the ruse.
*   **B)** Focuses on ""demise,"" which is not the central theme here.
*   **C)** ""Caring hearts"" isn't the operating force; it is caution and observation.
*   **D)** This pertains to cowardice, which is not the focus.
*   **E)** The Mother provided oversight; the story is about the Kid following that oversight to detect a fraud.

Historically, this specific Aesop's fable (""The Wolf and the Kid"") concludes with the moral that a hypocrite is often betrayed by their own characteristics or can be detected by the wary.

2.  **The Action:** The snake goes to the deity Apollo for advice or help.
3.  **Apollo's Wisdom:** Apollo tells the snake that the problem started because the snake didn't retaliate against the *first* person who stepped on it. 
4.  **The Lesson:** If the snake had asserted its power or delivered a punishment early on, the reputation of the snake's bite would have deterred everyone else from stepping on it.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) If people who have previously committed a crime are swiftly punished, then others will become afraid on their account.** This aligns perfectly with Apollo's advice. The ""crime"" (stepping on the snake) should have been punished ""swiftly"" (the first person) to create ""fear"" in others.
*   **B) Sometimes, Wicked people commit crime in haste but are not punished until much later.** The story isn't about the delay of justice for the wicked, but about the failure of the victim to deter others.
*   **C) Immediate actions often lack depth.** Apollo's advice is actually *promoting* immediate action (punishing the first person), so this contradicts the moral.
*   **D) Where creeping force is not enough, immediate cleverness must be used instead.** This sounds like a proverb, but it doesn't match the specific context of deterrence through retaliation described in the fable.
*   **E) Seeking refuge can lead to unexpected sanctuaries.** While the snake went to a temple, the focus of the story is the advice given, not the location itself.

**Conclusion:**
The story is about deterrence and the importance of setting a precedent. By failing to punish the first transgressor, the snake invited further abuse. Therefore, Option A is the correct interpretation.

morables_230,"A lion was standing over a young bull whom he had killed when a robber showed up and demanded a part of the spoils. 'I would agree,' the lion said, 'if you were not already in the habit of taking what",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interactions between the characters:

1.  **The Lion and the Robber:** The robber demands a share of the kill. The lion refuses him because the robber is a ""villain"" accustomed to taking things by force. This shows that arrogance and entitlement are met with resistance.
2.  **The Lion and the Wayfarer:** The wayfarer is ""innocent"" and ""modest."" He does not demand anything; in fact, he tries to withdraw out of respect and fear. The lion is moved by this lack of entitlement and rewards the wayfarer’s humility by sharing the prize and even stepping away to make the man feel comfortable.

Evaluation of the options:
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between the robber (force/resistance) and the wayfarer (humility/generosity).
*   **B)** This focuses on betrayal, which is not the central theme of this specific encounter.
*   **C)** While the lion is kind, the story is more about how the lion *responds* to different types of people rather than his nature being changed.
*   **D)** Cunning is not the focus; the wayfarer is portrayed as honest and modest, not cunning.
*   **E)** This focuses on the robber's perspective, but the story's outcome highlights the reward of the modest man.

The fable (traditionally attributed to Phaedrus) teaches that the arrogant and greedy are denied, while the humble and unassuming are rewarded.

Since he was constantly paying out money and spending great sums on the offerings, the god came to him one night and said: 'L",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Action:** A man is depicted as being excessively extravagant by making expensive sacrifices beyond his means.
2.  **The Conflict:** He is ""squandering his wealth"" and spending ""great sums,"" which leads to an inevitable path toward poverty.
3.  **The God's Response:** The god (the hero) intervenes not to ask for more, but to warn the man. The god's specific reasoning is that if the man becomes poor due to his own choices, he will unfairly shift the responsibility and blame the deity for his misfortune.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core of the story focuses on human nature's tendency to take foolish risks or be irresponsible and then seek a scapegoat—often divine or external—for the resulting consequences.

- **Choice A** directly reflects the god's warning: that people blame the gods for misfortunes caused by their own foolishness (in this case, financial recklessness).
- Choice B (promises) is not relevant to the text.
- Choice C (extravagance clouds counsel) is partially related but doesn't capture the ""blame"" aspect emphasized by the god.
- Choice D (profit) does not fit the man's motive of devotion or the god's warning.
- Choice E (devotion vs. offerings) is a modern sentiment, but the specific punchline of the fable is about avoiding self-inflicted blame.

The fable serves as a warning against being the architect of one's own ruin and then complaining to a higher power about the result.

morables_477,"A stag had grown thirsty and went to a spring in order to drink some water. When he saw the reflection of his body in the water, he disparaged the slenderness of his legs but revelled in the shape and",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Conflict:** The stag evaluates his physical traits based on aesthetics. He dislikes his thin legs (which he finds ugly) and prides himself on his large antlers (which he finds beautiful/impressive).
2.  **The Turning Point:** When the hunters arrive, his legs—the part of him he disparaged—provide the speed necessary to escape and keep him safe on level ground.
3.  **The Crisis:** Once he enters the marsh/woods, his antlers—the part of him he boasted about—get caught in the branches, leading to his capture.
4.  **The Realization:** In his final moments, the stag explicitly states the lesson: the ""ugly"" but functional parts were his salvation, while the ""beautiful"" but encumbering parts were his downfall.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) What is most truly valuable is often underrated.** This matches the stag's realization that his ""slender legs"" (which he underrated) were his true source of safety.
*   **B) It is often the case that people are greedy for things which they think will bring them honour...** While ""honour"" (the antlers) leads to destruction, the stag wasn't ""greedy"" for them; they were a natural part of him. This is a bit too specific regarding ""greed.""
*   **C) Persistence outshines vanity.** The story isn't about the hunters' persistence, but about the stag's physical attributes.
*   **D) Vain deceivers...** This is irrelevant as there are no deceivers in this fable.
*   **E) Pride in appearances can blind us to our true strengths.** This is a strong contender, but traditional Aesop's fables focus more on the external utility of things versus their appearance. Option A more accurately captures the contrast between the *objective value* of the legs versus the *perceived value* of the horns.

In many classical translations of Aesop's ""The Stag and the Water,"" the moral is explicitly stated as: ""We often despise what is most useful to us."" This aligns best with Option A.

But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot step-by-step:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Eagle, a powerful predator, ignores the plea of the Beetle (a small, seemingly insignificant creature) and disrespects her while hunting the Hare.
2.  **The Retaliation:** Despite being ""weak"" compared to the Eagle, the Beetle uses persistence and cleverness to destroy the Eagle's eggs repeatedly.
3.  **The Escalation:** Even when the Eagle seeks the protection of the highest authority (Jupiter), the Beetle finds a way to succeed in her vengeance.
4.  **The Resolution:** Jupiter acknowledges the Beetle's grievance. The story concludes with the realization that the Beetle was able to hold a much more powerful creature accountable for its arrogance and cruelty.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) The weak may find a way to avenge a wrong:** This aligns perfectly with the Beetle (the weak) successfully getting revenge on the Eagle (the strong) for the disrespect shown to her and the Hare.
*   **B) Greed for honor:** There is no mention of greed for honor leading to death in this story.
*   **C) Power in restraint:** While the Eagle lacked restraint, the core of the story is about the Beetle's retribution.
*   **D) Beauty and leadership:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) Compassion bridging divides:** The story is about vengeance and justice, not reconciliation between the predator and prey.

The fable (attributed to Aesop) is a classic example of the ""even the small can harm the great"" motif.

At a certain m",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the progression of events:

1.  **The Accident:** The donkey accidentally falls, the salt dissolves, and the load becomes lighter. This teaches the donkey that he can manipulate the weight of his burden by falling into the water.
2.  **The Deception:** The donkey intentionally falls a second time to repeat the result. He believes he has outsmarted the merchant.
3.  **The Counter-Strategy:** The merchant observes the donkey's behavior and realizes he is being tricked. To teach the donkey a lesson and stop the deception, he changes the cargo to sponges.
4.  **The Consequence:** The donkey tries his trick again, but because the sponges absorb water instead of dissolving, his plan backfires, and his burden becomes even heavier.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) You can fool someone only so many times:** This fits perfectly. The merchant was fooled once (by the accident) and perhaps twice (when the donkey fell on purpose), but he quickly realized the trick and turned the tables. The donkey's attempt to repeat his trickery led to his downfall.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you...**: This is irrelevant to the plot of the story.
*   **C) Cunning minds see wicked traps:** While the merchant used a ""trap,"" the focus is more on the failure of the donkey's recurring trickery rather than a general observation about traps.
*   **D) Everyone should be satisfied...**: This is overly complex and pessimistic, missing the central point of the merchant's reaction to the donkey's behavior.
*   **E) Sometimes, accidents can lighten the load...**: This describes the inciting incident but ignores the lesson learned from the donkey's intentional trickery and subsequent punishment.

The core lesson is that a trick used once successfully will not work forever, especially once the victim becomes aware of it.

Even after stroking the animal he was not sure of its i,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Premise:** A blind man uses his sense of touch to identify animals. This implies he relies on the inherent physical traits and ""feel"" of a creature rather than its visual appearance.
2.  **The Action:** He is presented with a wolf cub. Even though the animal is young and hasn't yet committed any acts of predation, the blind man senses something in its nature.
3.  **The Insight:** Use of touch tells him that while he can't pinpoint the exact species (wolf or fox), he recognizes a fundamental nature—one that is predatory and dangerous to sheep.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The story emphasizes that even at a very young age (a cub), an animal's inherent nature or ""evil"" potential is detectable. The man knows that, regardless of how small or young it is, it does not belong in a flock of sheep because of what it will grow up to do.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Evil tendencies are shown in early life:** This aligns perfectly with the man identifying the danger in a young cub.
*   **B) Harsh means vs. kind means:** This is not addressed in the text.
*   **C) Appearances can be misleading:** While true in some contexts, the man is blind, so he isn't judging by appearance. He is judging by ""nature.""
*   **D) Blind to reward/punishment:** This does not fit the narrative.
*   **E) Familiarity concealing truth:** The cub is not ""familiar"" to the man in a way that masks its danger.

This fable is one of Aesop's, and the traditional moral associated with it is that a ""villainous nature"" is apparent even in youth.

This man noticed that all sorts of people came to him, and he became curious to see who were true friend",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** A wealthy man is generous and always has a ""full table,"" attracting many people who enjoy his wealth.
2.  **The Test:** To distinguish between ""true friends"" and ""freeloaders,"" he creates a hypothetical scenario involving danger (a quarrel requiring swords).
3.  **The Result:** Out of a large crowd of guests, only two remain loyal and willing to help. The rest make excuses and leave.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The story explicitly states that the man identified who were ""true friends"" and who were merely ""hangers-on"" based on their willingness to sacrifice for him.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) True friends are hard to come by.** This is a valid observation, but the story is specifically about the *test* of friendship through adversity and the behavior of those who follow profit over loyalty.
*   **B)** This is irrelevant to the text provided.
*   **C)** While the man's generosity did attract freeloaders, the story focuses more on the *discovery* of their character rather than a warning against being generous.
*   **D) Excuse-making people adjust their loyal beliefs based on what is profitable for them.** This is a strong fit. The freeloaders were ""loyal"" as long as the ""profit"" (the food) was there, but as soon as a cost (a fight) was introduced, they changed their stance and made excuses.
*   **E) Generosity attracts company, but sincerity keeps it.** This is also a strong candidate, but the narrative focuses more on the *duplicity* of the guests and how their excuses reflect their shallow loyalty compared to the risk involved.

In the context of traditional fables (this is a variation of an Aesop-style fable), the focus is usually on the distinction between those who follow wealth versus those who follow the person. Most traditional interpretations of this specific fable highlight that ""Prosperity gains friends, and adversity tries them,"" or how people change their loyalty based on convenience. Option A is a universal truth, but the behavior of the ""excuse-makers"" shifting their loyalty when a price is asked is the central mechanic of the lesson.

However, in many literary contexts, **A** is the recognized ""moral"" regarding the scarcity of true loyalty. Let's look at the wording again: out of a ""full table,"" only ""two"" were friends. This emphasizes the rarity.

The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, 'Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch m",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the situation:

1.  **The Characters:** We have two pots—one made of earthenware (fragile) and one made of brass (strong/hard). 
2.  **The Conflict:** They are both being carried by the same river (life/circumstance).
3.  **The Dialogue:** The earthenware pot realizes that despite being in the same situation, the brass pot is a danger to it. Even a slight touch from a ""stronger"" or ""harder"" companion will result in the ""fragile"" one being shattered. 
4.  **The Lesson:** The core message is that friendship or close association between individuals of vastly different power, status, or strength is often dangerous for the weaker party. Therefore, it is safest to keep company with those who are your equals.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Equals make the best friends:** This aligns with the traditional wisdom of this Aesop's fable (*The Two Pots*). It highlights that associating with those too different in ""strength"" leads to the destruction of the weaker.
*   **B)** Focuses on overestimating worth, but the earthenware pot is actually being very realistic and humble about its fragility.
*   **C), E)** are modern, ""everyone is valuable"" sentiments that do not reflect the cautionary nature of ancient fables.
*   **D)** Is a nonsensical phrasing in this context.

The wild boar replied, 'I have",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Action:** The wild boar is sharpening his tusks during a time of peace/quiet (when there is ""no immediate need"").
2.  **The Reasoning:** The boar explains that once danger actually arrives, it will be too late to prepare. He must have his weapons ready beforehand so he can use them immediately.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches the importance of foresight and being prepared for future challenges before they occur.

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace:** This aligns with the idea of being ready for conflict (""sharpening tusks"") beforehand. In many versions of Aesop's fables, the moral for this specific story is ""Preparedness is the best defense"" or ""In time of peace, prepare for war.""
*   **B) God is the ultimate judge:** This is unrelated to the text.
*   **C) Curiosity must be guided by prudence:** This might refer to the fox, but the fox isn't the one being taught a lesson; the boar is the exemplar of the story.
*   **D) Prudent men feel worst when they contribute to their own inquisitive undoing:** This is the moral for a different fable (often ""The Eagle and the Arrow"").
*   **E) Even nature prepares its own defenses:** While true in a literal sense, it doesn't capture the ""prudence/preparedness"" lesson intended for the reader as well as option A.

When the depositor then summoned him to swear an oath regarding the deposit, he realized the danger he was in and prepar",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the dialogue between the man and the god, Oath:

1.  **The Deception:** A man intends to steal a deposit and plans to swear a false oath to get away with it.
2.  **The Encounter:** He meets Oath, who tells him that he usually revisits cities every thirty or forty years.
3.  **The False Security:** Relying on this timeline, the man feels safe to commit perjury immediately, believing punishment is decades away.
4.  **The Punishment:** Oath returns the very next day to punish him.
5.  **The Lesson:** Oath explains that while he may take decades to return to some, he can return the very same day for those who deliberately provoke him or test his patience.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) There is no fixed day on which wicked people are punished:** This directly reflects the climax of the story. The man tried to rely on a ""schedule"" for divine justice, but Oath proved that justice can strike at any time, especially when provoked.
*   **B) Often there is more good to be found in one man than in a crowd of people:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C) Fear distorts the divine truth:** While the man was afraid, it was his greed and overconfidence, not fear, that led to his downfall.
*   **D) He who incites to deceptive strife...:** This does not fit the specific interaction between the mortal and the god regarding the timing of justice.
*   **E) Taking what isn't yours... leaves a lasting debt on your conscience:** While the man stole, the story focuses on the unpredictable timing of divine retribution rather than the internal feeling of guilt.

The core of this Aesopic fable (often numbered 239 in the Perry Index) is that divine justice is unpredictable and ""has a long shadow,"" meaning one should never assume they have escaped punishment just because it hasn't happened yet.

1.  **Phase One:** The farmer asks his neighbors for help. The mother Lark is not worried because she knows that relying on others' favors often leads to procrastination and lack of action.
2.  **Phase Two:** The farmer decides to take the matter into his own hands and hire workers directly, showing he is ready to do the work himself. The mother Lark realizes the harvest will finally happen because the farmer is no longer waiting for others to do his work for him.

The lesson is that a task is most likely to be completed when the person responsible for it takes the initiative to do it themselves rather than waiting for friends or neighbors.

*   **A) Self-help is the best help:** This matches the theme of individual responsibility and taking action for oneself.
*   **B) Cunning often outwits itself:** This does not apply, as there is no trickery involved.
*   **C) Wisdom grows with determination:** While the Lark is wise, the core lesson is about the farmer's self-reliance.
*   **D) Do unto others...:** This is the Golden Rule, which is not the focus of this fable.
*   **E) Even the tiniest cradle...:** This is a poetic sentiment about nature, not a moral lesson regarding the farmer's actions.

1.  **The Context:** Aesop, a wise man, is seen engaging in a ""childish"" activity (playing marbles). An observer mocks him, assuming that a wise or serious person should always be ""on"" or acting with gravity.
2.  **The Metaphor:** Aesop uses an unstrung bow as an analogy. A bow is a tool designed for tension and work. 
3.  **The Lesson:** Aesop explains that a bow kept under constant tension will break. It needs periods of being ""unstrung"" (relaxation/play) to maintain its strength and utility for when it is truly needed. 
4.  **The Application:** Just as a bow needs rest to remain effective, the human mind and spirit need play and relaxation to remain sharp and functional. Constant ""stringing"" (seriousness or hard work) leads to burnout or failure.

Looking at the options:
- **A** directly addresses the lesson of the bow: that rest is essential for maintaining functionality and clarity.
- **B** is irrelevant to the plot.
- **C** describes the observer's state, but isn't the primary lesson.
- **D** focuses on the confrontation rather than the philosophy of the bow.
- **E** is a secondary observation, but the core ""meaning"" requested by Aesop's challenge is the necessity of rest.

The primary moral is that continuous strain destroys one's capacity, and relaxation is necessary for long-term effectiveness.

'I breed only one,' said the lioness, 'but he is very ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the sow and the lioness:

1.  **The Characters:** The sow is characterized by her ""whole litter"" (large quantity), while the lioness has produced ""only one"" offspring.
2.  **The Conflict:** The sow ""loudly accosts"" the lioness, essentially boasting about the number of her children as a metric of superiority.
3.  **The Resolution:** The lioness dismisses the importance of weight or volume, pointing out that while she only has one child, that child is ""very well bred"" (a lion—a creature of high status, strength, and quality).
4.  **The Lesson:** The contrast is between the **quantity** (the sow's many piglets) and the **quality** (the lioness's superior single cub). The story argues that having one thing of extreme value and excellence is better than having many things of low value or commonality.

- Option A directly addresses this comparison.
- Option B refers to gossip, which isn't the core focus.
- Option C mentions humility, but the lioness is actually quite proud in her retort.
- Option D discusses physical danger, which is not the point of the dialogue.
- Option E focuses on nurturing, while the text focuses on the inherent nature/quality of the offspring.

morables_179,"Running swiftly, balancing on the razor's edge, bald but with a lock of hair on his forehead, he wears no clothes; if you grasp him from the front, you might be able to hold him, but once he has moved",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s break down the symbolism used in the text:

1.  **The Description:** Opportunity is described as moving swiftly on a ""razor's edge,"" indicating that the window of time is extremely thin and passing quickly.
2.  **The Appearance:** He is bald except for a ""lock of hair on his forehead."" This is a classical allegorical representation (often associated with the Greek deity Kairos). If he is coming toward you, you can grab the hair on his forehead (the front).
3.  **The Consequence:** Once he has passed, his head is bald in the back, meaning there is nothing left to grab. Even ""Jupiter himself"" (the king of the gods) cannot bring him back or catch him from behind once he has moved on.
4.  **The Lesson:** The text explicitly states this is a symbol of ""the brief moment in which things are possible."" 

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Seize opportunities when they arise.** This matches the symbolism perfectly: you must grab the ""lock of hair"" while it is in front of you, or the moment is lost forever.
*   **B) Be content with your lot.** The story is about action and timing, not contentment.
*   **C) Power without purpose is ineffectual.** The story focuses on the fleeting nature of time, not the application of power.
*   **D) Boast of one powerful thing...** This is unrelated to the imagery of the swift, bald figure.
*   **E) Every daring act teeters on...** While there is a mention of a ""razor's edge,"" the conclusion of the story focuses on the impossibility of catching opportunity once it has passed, rather than the vulnerability of the actor.

The central theme is that one must act immediately when an opportunity presents itself.

morables_597,"A fox was standing not far from a trap, pondering every possible approach. A nearby wolf noticed the fox and approached her. He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The fox recognizes a danger (the trap) and chooses not to engage with it directly. Instead, when the wolf asks for the meat, the fox uses ""flattery"" and false friendship (""you are one of my very dearest friends"") to encourage the wolf to step into the danger. The fox is being deceptive to see what happens to the trap or simply to harm the wolf for her own benefit.
2.  **The Wolf's Action:** The wolf trusts the fox's words at face value and acts without caution, leading to his injury.
3.  **The Outcome:** The wolf realizes the fox's ""gift"" was a trap and questions the value of such a treacherous friendship.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Flatterers and deceivers are not to be trusted:** This fits perfectly. The fox used flattery and the guise of friendship to deceive the wolf into a dangerous situation.
*   **B) Know yourself and your limits:** This is more applicable to fables like ""The Tortoise and the Hare."" 
*   **C) Trust can be a double-edged sword:** While true, the focus of Aesop-style fables in this context is usually on the nature of the deceiver.
*   **D) A single reliable skill is worth more than a bag of cunning, deceptive tricks:** This is the specific moral for ""The Cat and the Fox,"" where the cat's one skill (climbing a tree) saves it while the fox's many tricks fail.
*   **E) Caution is wise, but collaboration can reveal new paths:** The story shows the opposite of helpful collaboration.

The story serves as a warning against those who offer ""gifts"" or favors that are actually traps, and specifically highlights that a deceptive person's ""friendship"" is dangerous.

morables_199,"There was a bull who was pastured on a little island. Two dung beetles lived there too, feeding on the bull's manure. Winter was approaching, so one of the dung beetles said to the other, 'I want to g",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the outcome:

1.  **The Promise:** One beetle promises to bring back food to the other if he finds a good feeding ground on the mainland. This promise is made when times are stable, but a change (winter) is coming.
2.  **The Result:** The beetle finds plenty of food, becomes ""plump and fat,"" but returns empty-handed.
3.  **The Excuse:** The beetle blames the ""nature of the place,"" claiming that while he could eat there, the food could not be transported.
4.  **The Lesson:** The promise made by the beetle was ultimately ""empty."" He enjoyed the benefits for himself but failed to fulfill his commitment to his friend. The fable highlights that some people make grand promises when they are setting out to better their own situation, but they do not follow through once they have achieved their goals.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses the failure to follow through on a promise made during a transition to ""good times"" (the mainland's abundance).
*   **B** refers to power dynamics (like the fable of the Eagle and the Beetle), which isn't present here.
*   **C** focuses on curiosity, whereas this story is about resource allocation and broken promises.
*   **D** focuses on timing/procrastination, which isn't the core issue.
*   **E** focuses on the dung beetles' nature, but the conflict of the story is between the two beetles, not their diet.

Therefore, the moral concerns the reliability of promises made by those seeking their own fortune.

morables_393,"There were two frogs whose pond had dried up, so they went looking for a new place to live. When they came to a well, one of them thought that they should jump in immediately, but the other one said, ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s break down the story step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** Two frogs are looking for a new home because their current one has dried up.
2.  **The Impulse:** One frog sees a well and immediately wants to jump in because it contains water.
3.  **The Caution:** The second frog pauses to consider the long-term consequences. While the well has water now, if that water were to dry up (just like their pond did), the depth of the well would make it impossible for them to climb back out.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story emphasizes the importance of considering the potential risks and the ""exit strategy"" of a situation before committing to it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Look before you leap:** This is a literal and figurative match for the story. The frogs are literally considering a ""leap"" into a well, and the moral advice is to investigate the consequences before acting.
*   **B) Watch the actions of your enemy:** There are no enemies in this story.
*   **C) Haste often leads to regret:** While related, the core of the story is specifically about looking ahead at potential dangers, making ""Look before you leap"" the more precise and traditional moral associated with this Aesop's fable.
*   **D) Impulsive, vicious people...:** There is no malice or ""hurting of others"" in this story.
*   **E) Adaptability is key...:** The frogs are trying to adapt, but the story's climax focuses on the warning against being shortsighted.

The most accurate moral is ""Look before you leap.""

morables_368,"Thanks to his excellent qualities, Hercules was received into heaven. He saluted the gods who came to congratulate him one after another, but when he was approached by Plutus, the god of wealth and th",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Characters and Context:** Hercules is admitted to heaven as a reward for his ""excellent qualities"" (virtue/bravery). He is greeted by the gods.
2.  **The Conflict:** Hercules snubbed Plutus, the god of wealth.
3.  **The Reasoning:** When asked by Jupiter why he ignored Plutus, Hercules explained that he hates the god of riches because wealth is a ""friend to the wicked"" and ""corrupts the entire world.""
4.  **Identifying the Lesson:** Hercules represents virtue and merit. His disdain for Plutus highlights a fundamental conflict between moral excellence and material wealth. The story suggests that wealth often favors the undeserving (the wicked) and acts as a corrupting force, whereas Hercules reached heaven through his own merit and ""excellent qualities.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** While relevant to the theme of corruption, it's a bit specific/archaic.
*   **B:** Focuses on a ""threat to welfare,"" which isn't the primary point mentioned by Hercules.
*   **C:** Direct and accurate. Hercules achieved the highest reward (heaven) through excellence, and he views wealth as something separate from (and often opposed to) virtue or merit.
*   **D:** Focuses on ""thieves,"" which isn't the central theme.
*   **E:** This is a strong contender, as it explains how Hercules got to heaven. However, the dialogue in the fable specifically focuses on the *disdain* for wealth as a corrupting force.

Comparing C and E: While Hercules' virtue got him to heaven (E), the specific ""lesson"" or ""moral"" derived from the interaction with Plutus is the critique of wealth. In traditional interpretations of this Aesop's fable, the moral highlights that wealth is often the companion of the wicked and does not equate to or satisfy true virtue. Choice C (""Wealth cannot buy true excellence"") best captures the tension between Hercules' earned status and Plutus' bought/corrupting influence.

morables_301,"A dog made false accusations against the sheep, demanding that she pay him back a loaf of bread which, he insisted, the sheep had supposedly borrowed from him. The dog summoned the wolf as his witness",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Conflict:** A dog falsely accuses a sheep of a debt and brings a false witness (the wolf) to support his lie.
2.  **The Injustice:** Due to the wolf's perjury, the innocent sheep is punished and forced to pay a penalty she does not owe.
3.  **The Resolution:** Shortly thereafter, the sheep encounters the wolf dead in a ditch. 
4.  **The Lesson:** The sheep identifies the wolf's fate as a ""reward"" from the gods for lying.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Wicked liars generally get their just consequences:** This aligns perfectly with the sheep's concluding statement. The wolf lied to harm the sheep, and he met a miserable end, which the story frames as a form of divine justice or ""poetic justice.""
*   **B) Harsh means/Reason:** The story is not about discipline or teaching a lesson through force; it is about deception and justice.
*   **C) Deception masks innocence:** While true in the middle of the story, the final focus is on the fate of the deceiver.
*   **D) One insult invites another:** This story is about legal/moral perjury, not a cycle of insults.
*   **E) Fabric of trust:** While false claims do destroy trust, the story’s specific ending emphasizes the punishment of the liar rather than the social utility of trust.

The sheep's final remark specifically points to the idea that those who bear false witness will eventually face retribution.

morables_428,"A Lark, caught in a snare, pleaded earnestly with the Fowler for her life. 'What have I done that I must die?' said she; 'I have stolen neither gold nor silver, but only a grain of corn to satisfy my ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation:** A Lark is caught in a trap by a Fowler (the adversary).
2.  **The Plea:** The Lark attempts to make a logical and moral argument for her life, pointing out that her ""crime"" (eating a grain of corn) is minor and she hasn't stolen valuable items like gold.
3.  **The Response:** The Fowler ignores the logic and the plea entirely. He acts as both the captor (adversary) and the executioner (judge).
4.  **The Outcome:** The Lark is killed despite her reasonable defense because the Fowler is not interested in justice or mercy; he simply wants his catch.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) When your adversary is also your judge, don't bother arguing:** This matches the story perfectly. The Fowler has the power and a conflict of interest; no amount of reasoning from the Lark will change his mind because he is not an impartial judge.
*   **B) People are willing to risk their lives for the sake of some petty profit:** While the Lark died for ""a grain of corn,"" the story focuses more on the futility of her plea to her captor.
*   **C) Mercy is louder than silence:** The story shows a lack of mercy, and the silence of the Fowler is what precedes the Lark's death, contradicting this statement.
*   **D) Do not trade what might come...:** This is overly complex and does not fit the narrative of the Lark and the Fowler.
*   **E) In moments of vulnerability, sincerity can be a powerful plea:** The story proves the opposite; the Lark's sincerity did nothing to save her.

Historically, this fable from Aesop is often titled ""The Lark and the Fowler,"" and its traditional moral is that it is useless to argue with those who are determined to do you harm and hold the power to do so.

morables_82,"Be quiet now, said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap. If you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf. Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Promise/Threat:** The Nurse makes a statement to the child: ""If you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf.""
2.  **The Expectation:** The Wolf, overhearing this, believes the Nurse's words are a binding promise or a literal truth. He waits patiently for the child to cry so he can receive his ""morsel.""
3.  **The Reality:** The child cries, but instead of fulfilling her previous statement, the Nurse protects the child and calls the dogs to attack the Wolf.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Wolf learned the hard way that one should not trust the words of an enemy (or someone in an opposing position). In traditional Aesop’s fables, this specific story—often titled ""The Nurse and the Wolf""—is used to illustrate that the threats or promises made by enemies (or those we view as such) are not to be relied upon.

Let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Enemies' promises were made to be broken:** This fits perfectly. The Nurse’s ""promise"" to give the child to the Wolf was not kept, showing that the Wolf was foolish to believe her words.
*   **B), C), D), E):** None of these accurately reflect the core conflict between the Wolf's expectations based on the Nurse's words and the Nurse's actual actions.

In many classical translations of this fable, the moral is explicitly stated as: ""Enemies' promises were made to be broken,"" or ""Do not believe everything you hear.""

Then the fly laughed at the man and said, 'You wanted to avenge the sting of a ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the actions:

1.  **The Conflict:** A man hurts himself while trying to kill a fly that bit him.
2.  **The Fly’s Argument:** The fly mocks the man, suggesting that by slapping himself, he has committed a greater ""crime"" or ""injury"" against himself than the fly did, and asks how he will punish himself.
3.  **The Man’s Rebuttal:** The man distinguishes between the **intent** of his actions and the **intent** of the fly. 
    *   He forgives himself because his intent was not self-harm (it was an accidental byproduct of a necessary action).
    *   He condemns the fly because its intent is inherently malicious (""delight in drinking human blood"").
4.  **The Conclusion:** The man emphasizes that he is willing to endure personal inconvenience or pain if it means stopping a malicious enemy.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Intent matters more than the outcome:** This aligns perfectly with the man's explanation. He forgives the ""bad outcome"" (the slap) because the ""intent"" (killing the fly) was justified, and he condemns the fly despite its ""small"" bite because its nature is malicious.
*   **B) Rudeness and sharing:** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **C) Forgiveness outshines mockery:** While the man forgives himself, the core of the story is the debate over the *reason* for that forgiveness (intent vs. accident).
*   **D) Frustrated self-effort:** This is overly wordy and doesn't capture the ethical debate presented.
*   **E) In anger, we may cause ourselves more harm:** While the man *did* cause himself harm, the story actually ends with him *defending* his actions as justifiable, rather than a warning against his anger. He explicitly states he would do it again to get rid of the fly.

The fable (Phraedrus 5.3) focuses on the distinction between injuries done by accident and those done on purpose.

1.  **The Cat's Intentions:** The cat wants the eel but doesn't want to get wet to catch one. He uses two tactics to get the stork to drop her meal: first, flattery (praising her beauty to get her to open her mouth) and then, when that fails, insults (calling her filthy for eating snakes).
2.  **The Stork's Reaction:** The stork recognizes the trap. She knows that if she responds to the flattery or the insults, she will open her mouth and lose her prize. She remains silent and keeps walking, ignoring the cat's attempts to distract or provoke her.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the importance of staying focused on one's objective and not being swayed by external chatter—whether it is praise meant to deceive or insults meant to provoke. The stork's success lies in her refusal to be distracted from her goal (keeping her meal).

While ""Flattery often masks hidden intentions"" (E) describes the cat's initial behavior, the ultimate resolution of the story—and the reason the stork succeeds—is her refusal to engage, proving that staying focused on the goal is the key to protecting what you have.

1.  **The Opportunity:** The wolf had the dog in a vulnerable position (""sleeping in front of the barn"") and could have eaten him immediately.
2.  **The Deception:** the dog used a persuasive promise (getting ""fattened up"" at a wedding) to convince the wolf to delay his meal.
3.  **The Result:** The wolf lost his opportunity. When he returned, the dog had secured himself in a safe place (""on the roof"") where the wolf could no longer reach him.
4.  **The Lesson:** The dog’s final remark—telling the wolf not to wait for a wedding next time—highlights that the wolf should have seized the opportunity when it first presented itself.

Looking at the options:
*   **B, C, and E** touch on themes within the story but do not capture the central ""lesson"" for the reader/wolf.
*   **D** focuses on the ""predatory nature"" of enemies, but in this specific fable, the dog is the ""prey"" using his wits to survive, and his promise was a tactic to escape, not a display of a predatory nature. 
*   **A** directly addresses the wolf's mistake: he had a guaranteed meal and let it go based on the hope of something better in the future. This aligns with the classic Aesop motif that a ""bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."" If you have an advantage or a goal within reach, you should take it rather than risking it for a potential future gain.

When he finally decided to disembark, he said, 'I will let myself down now as fast as I can so as not to burden",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the gnat and the camel step by step:

1.  **The Gnat’s Perspective:** The gnat believes his presence is a significant burden to the camel. He speaks as if his departure is a major favor that will provide relief to the ""weighed down"" animal. This indicates an inflated sense of self-importance.
2.  **The Camel’s Perspective:** The camel is so large and the gnat is so small that the camel didn't even notice the gnat's arrival and is indifferent to his departure. The gnat's ""burden"" was non-existent.
3.  **The Lesson:** The contrast between the gnat's self-perception and the reality of his impact on others highlights human vanity. Many people believe they are central figures in a situation or exert great influence, while others barely notice they are there.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the gnat's inflated self-image versus the camel's indifference.
*   **B:** While the gnat is being ""arrogant"" or ""foolish,"" the core of the story is specifically about *perceived importance* rather than general influence.
*   **C & D:** These focus on the camel's patience or wisdom, which are not the primary focus of the gnat's behavior.

The fox turned to the women and said, 'What shouts there would be aga",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the fox and the women:

1.  **The Situation:** The fox observes women eating roasted chickens in silence. He notes a double standard: if he were to eat those same chickens, people would shout and set dogs on him.
2.  **The Fox's Grievance:** He is complaining about the unfairness of the reaction to the act of eating chickens based on *who* is doing the eating.
3.  **The Rebuttal:** The old woman points out the fundamental difference: the women are eating what they **own** (their property), whereas the fox takes what belongs to **others** (theft).
4.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches that rights and permissions are tied to ownership and legality. Just because someone has the right to use or consume their own property doesn't mean a stranger has the right to take it.

Why are you trying to wound me with your teeth,",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the viper and the file:

1.  **The Action:** A viper tries to bite a metal file, treating it as if it were soft prey that could be wounded or eaten.
2.  **The Reaction:** The file points out the absurdity of the viper's attempt. Because the file is made of hardened iron—a material designed to cut and ""gnaw"" through other metals—the viper’s teeth are useless against it.
3.  **The Lesson:** The viper is attacking something that cannot be harmed by its venom or its bite. The file is ""insensible"" (impervious/unfeeling) to the viper's standard weapons. Trying to harm someone or something that is significantly stronger, harder, or more resilient than oneself is a futile effort that only harms the attacker.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) It is useless attacking the insensible:** This matches the core theme. The file is impervious to the viper's bite. In some translations of Aesop, the moral is specifically stated as ""It is foolish to try to hurt those who can hurt you more"" or ""It is useless to attack those who are stronger than you."" ""Insensible"" here refers to something that cannot be affected or ""bitten.""
*   **B)** Irrelevant to the story.
*   **C)** While the viper was curious/hungry, the main point is the futility of the attack on a harder object.
*   **D)** Irrelevant to the story.
*   **E)** The file only boasts *after* being attacked; it didn't invite the challenge.

As they were disputing, they passed a statue carv",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the Man and the Lion:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Man and the Lion are arguing over who is superior.
2.  **The Evidence:** The Man points to a statue as ""proof"" of human superiority because it shows a human defeating a lion.
3.  **The Rebuttal:** The Lion points out a fundamental flaw in the evidence: the statue was created by a human. If a lion had created the statue, the depiction would be the opposite.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that ""truth"" or ""history"" is often dictated by the perspective of the person telling the story (or creating the monument). A single piece of evidence or a single narrative is biased toward the creator.

Now let's look at the options:
*   **A) One story is good, till another is told:** This aligns perfectly with the Lion's point. The Man's ""story"" (the statue) seemed definitive until the Lion provided the alternative perspective of how the story would look from his side.
*   **B) The hero is brave in deeds...:** This is not relevant; the story is about representation and perspective, not the verification of specific deeds.
*   **C, D, and E)** While the characters are being prideful/boastful, the core of the Lion's witty comeback is specifically about the **source and bias of information**, not just the act of being proud.

The fable teaches that perspective matters and that those who tell the story control the narrative. This is most accurately summarized by the proverb: ""One story is good, till another is told.""

On his way to the assembly of the birds, the peaco",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the motivations of the characters:

1.  **The Character's Motivation:** The peacock is described as beautiful and gentle. When the raven asks for feathers, the peacock asks, ""What will you do for me in return?"" The raven offers to ""squawk your praises throughout the courts."" This indicates that the peacock's motivation for giving away his feathers is the desire for fame, status, and external validation (vanity).
2.  **The Action:** The peacock continues to give his feathers away to any bird that asks, presumably for the same reward of being praised. This shows an obsessive need for flattery that overrides his survival instincts.
3.  **The Consequence:** By giving away his feathers to feed his ego, the peacock loses his ability to protect his chicks and himself. Without feathers, he cannot survive the winter and dies.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story warns that sacrificing one's essential resources and responsibilities in exchange for superficial praise and vanity leads to ruin.

**Critique of options:**
*   **A) Vanity can lead to self-destruction:** This fits perfectly. The peacock destroyed himself by trading his means of survival for empty praise.
*   **B) Do not boast...:** The peacock actually had the feathers; he didn't lie about them.
*   **C) Opportunism...:** While the other birds were opportunists, the story focuses on the peacock's fatal decision-making.
*   **D) Sorrow not...:** The story doesn't involve the peacock moving on from loss; it involves his death due to his choices.
*   **E) True beauty shines...:** The story ends in tragedy, showing that the peacock's ""kindness"" (which was actually fueled by a desire for praise) led to his demise, not a positive outcome.

The clear moral is that seeking validation through vanity can result in losing everything.

You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth as a w",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Conflict:** A small gnat challenges a mighty lion, claiming superior strength.
2.  **The Victory:** Through agility and targeting the lion's weaknesses, the gnat successfully defeats the lion, causing the beast to wound itself.
3.  **The Turn of Events:** The gnat, filled with pride and ""buzzing about in a song of triumph,"" fails to notice a simple cobweb.
4.  **The Resolution:** The gnat is caught and eaten by a tiny spider, a much smaller and less ""noble"" adversary than the lion he just defeated.

**Analysis of the Morals:**
*   **A** is a strong candidate because the gnat's downfall happens immediately after his victory and boasting. It highlights that no one is invincible regardless of their past triumphs.
*   **B** refers to a different fable archetype (the treacherous enemy).
*   **C** is close, but the story is more about the irony of a great victor falling to a small, insignificant threat.
*   **D** focus on ""cunning,"" which helped the gnat win, but the gnat's undoing was lack of vigilance, not his own cunning.
*   **E** relates to the first half of the story (the gnat's strength) but fails to encompass the second half (the spider).

The core lesson of this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Gnat and the Lion"") is that the pride of a great victory can blind one to small, everyday dangers. The gnat conquered the ""hugest beast"" only to be ""undone"" by the ""most inconsiderable"" creature. This aligns best with the idea that no matter how much you brag or how great your victory, you are never beyond the reach of defeat.

All of a sudden a tuna fish",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events:
1. The fishermen use their **skill** and effort (struggling for a long time) but fail to catch anything.
2. They give up and prepare to leave, feeling ""downcast.""
3. Without any effort or skill on their part, a fish (fleeing another predator) **leaps** into their boat.
4. They succeed purely through chance/accident rather than their own merit.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses the conflict between **skill** (which failed) and **luck** (which provided the fish).
*   **B** refers to a different type of fable (usually ""The Fir-tree and the Bramble"") regarding size and reputation.
*   **C** describes the shift in mood but isn't the underlying lesson.
*   **D** is grammatically nonsensical in this context.
*   **E** contradicts the text; the fishermen were giving up, and the reward came from chance, not their perseverance.

Historically, this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Fishermen and the Tuna"") is used to illustrate that fortune can provide what labor cannot.

Not withstanding all his prayers, instead of becoming richer, he got poorer. Out ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Action:** A man prays to a wooden idol for wealth, but his situation worsens.
2.  **The Turning Point:** Frustrated and impatient, he destroys the idol (an act of ""violence"" or ""force"" against his former object of worship).
3.  **The Discovery:** Breaking the idol reveals hidden gold.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The man immediately shifts his perspective. Instead of seeing the idol as a holy object deserving of prayer, he calls it a ""graceless deity"" and concludes that force is more effective than worship.

**Analysis of the Options:**
- **A:** This fits the man's behavior perfectly. As long as he thought prayer would bring wealth, he prayed. When that failed, he destroyed the idol. Upon finding the gold, he justified his violent actions by claiming the deity only responds to force. His ""belief"" in the sanctity of the idol was discarded as soon as a different approach proved profitable.
- **B:** The man is not described as finding ""ugly things beautiful""; he is seeking wealth.
- **C:** The outcome was not graceless; it was actually very successful for him (he found gold).
- **D:** This is a nonsensical phrasing that doesn't apply to the narrative logic.
- **E:** While the man was ""bold"" in breaking the idol, the phrasing of the man's final exclamation specifically highlights a shift in his rationalization and attitude toward the deity based on the result.

In many classic interpretations of Aesop's fables (from which this story originates), this specific tale serves as a cynical commentary on human nature: we revere things when we think they help us, and we despise or ""correct"" them when they don't, often justifying our shifting attitudes based on whatever outcome is most profitable.

Then the little gnat said to the bull, 'It's enough for me that you have accepted my ch",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Premise:** A tiny gnat challenges a massive, powerful bull to a contest of strength.
2.  **The Gnat's Strategy:** The gnat does not actually fight the bull. Instead, it claims victory simply because the bull *accepted* the challenge. By agreeing to compete, the bull implicitly acknowledged the gnat as a peer or a legitimate threat.
3.  **The Outcome:** The gnat gains unearned prestige and boasting rights, while the bull is left frustrated and looks foolish for entertaining such an absurd challenge.
4.  **The Author's Commentary:** The text explicitly states that if the bull had been ""mindful of his own mighty bulk,"" he would have ignored the gnat as being ""beneath contempt."" By ignoring him, the gnat would have had nothing to boast about.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. By engaging with an unworthy opponent, the bull lowered himself to the gnat's level and gave the gnat the opportunity to boast of equality.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there is no mention of children or education.
*   **C:** While pride is involved, the story isn't about a ""downfall"" in the tragic sense, but specifically about the loss of status through inappropriate association/competition.
*   **D:** Nonsensical in the context of the story.
*   **E:** While the contest was futile, the core lesson emphasizes the damage to the superior party's reputation for engaging in the first place.

The primary lesson is that the superior party grants a status boost to an inferior one simply by acknowledging them as an opponent.

The owner began to question the dog, asking how he could be so ungra",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the conflict between the owner and the dog:

1.  **The Owner’s Perspective:** The owner claims to be ""kind"" because he never personally struck the dog or spoke harsh words. He believes his hands are ""clean"" because he did not physically perform the acts of cruelty.
2.  **The Dog’s Perspective:** The dog argues that the distinction between the owner doing it and the owner *ordering* it is non-existent. The source of the pain is the owner’s authority and will, regardless of whose hand holds the whip.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches that a person is responsible for the actions they delegate or command. Using an intermediary does not absolve one of moral or practical responsibility.

Looking at the options:
- **A** directly reflects this lesson: ""What a person does through another is truly their own action.""
- **B** focuses on ""wicked words,"" which is too narrow; the issue here is delegated action.
- **C** is the owner's incorrect interpretation of the situation.
- **D** refers to trust and safety, but the core of this story is about the delegation of cruelty.
- **E** is a minor plot point (how the dog was found) but not the moral lesson.

1.  **The Situation:** A butcher enters a flock and begins taking sheep one by one to be slaughtered.
2.  **The Reaction:** The sheep ignore the threat because it is not affecting them personally at that moment. They rationalize their inaction by saying, ""He keeps his hands off me... let him take whom he takes."" They lack solidarity.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because they did not act together when they had the strength of numbers, they were picked off individually until only one remained.
4.  **The Realization:** The last sheep realizes that their failure to act collectively and protect the first members of the flock led to their ultimate demise. If they had attacked the butcher as a group (""smashing you between our horns""), they could have survived.

**Option analysis:**
*   **A) If you don't speak out for others, there will be nobody left to speak out for you.** This aligns perfectly with the theme of individual apathy leading to collective ruin. It mirrors the famous ""First they came..."" sentiment.
*   **B)** This refers to making a situation worse, which doesn't fit here.
*   **C)** While they ""faced the truth"" at the end, the lesson focuses on the failure of collective action/protection.
*   **D)** This describes a different type of fable (like Aesop's ""The Dog and the Cook"").
*   **E)** The butcher is an enemy, not someone the sheep are trying to ""fit in"" with.

The core lesson is that by ignoring the plight of their peers, the sheep ensured their own destruction.

1.  **The Action:** A hooligan commits a reckless act (striking Aesop with a stone).
2.  **The Reinforcement:** Instead of punishing him, Aesop rewards him with a coin. This creates a false sense of success in the hooligan's mind—he believes his bad behavior is profitable.
3.  **The Escalation:** Encouraged by his initial ""success,"" the hooligan repeats the behavior on a more powerful target, expecting a greater reward.
4.  **The Consequence:** Because he was misled by his previous success, he is captured and executed.

Now, let's look at the options:
*   **A) Success leads many astray to their ruin.** This fits perfectly. The hooligan’s initial ""success"" (getting a coin from Aesop) gave him the confidence to commit a larger crime that ultimately destroyed him.
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for.** The hooligan didn't exactly ""wish"" for something that had unintended consequences; he was actively manipulated.
*   **C) Clever minds outwit reckless wealth.** Aesop is clever, but the target was ""wealthy,"" not the one being outwitted.
*   **D) Avoid reckless overindulgence in manipulative pursuits.** This is vaguely related but focuses on the wrong actor (the hooligan wasn't being manipulative; he was the one being manipulated).
*   **E) Responding with grace can disarm hostility.** Aesop’s response wasn't ""graceful"" in the moral sense; it was a calculated trap (sarcastic ""well done"").

The traditional moral of this specific Phaedrus fable (often titled ""Aesop and the Hooligan"") is that success in a small wrongdoing often encourages a person to attempt a larger one that results in their downfall.

1.  **Winter’s Perspective:** Winter prides itself on its power and ability to control human behavior through fear and restriction. It compares itself to a ""dictator or a despot,"" noting that it makes people ""tremble"" and forces them to stay indoors, focusing on the ground rather than the sky. Winter equates power with dominance and intimidation.
2.  **Spring’s Perspective:** Spring responds by pointing out the consequences of such behavior. Because Winter is harsh and restrictive, people wish for it to leave. In contrast, Spring is characterized by beauty, freedom, and the joy it brings to others. Spring notes that its very name brings pleasure, and people are grateful for its arrival and fond of its memory.
3.  **The Lesson:** The contrast highlights two different ways of exercising influence: one through fear and force (Winter/Despotism) and the other through kindness and inspiration (Spring/Benevolence). Spring’s final argument—that people are glad to get rid of Winter but give thanks for Spring—emphasizes that being valued and welcomed is superior to being feared and avoided.

This directly aligns with the classic theme that a leader or entity is more successful and respected when they earn the love of others rather than their fear.

1.  **The Situation**: A soldier owns a high-quality, useful, and beautiful horse. He then acquires a second horse that is objectively inferior (less beautiful and less useful).
2.  **The Action**: Despite the obvious disparity in quality, the soldier neglects the superior horse and showers the inferior new horse with more care and attention.
3.  **The Observation**: Observers notice the irrationality of his behavior, as the new horse hasn't earned this favor through merit or utility.
4.  **The Conclusion**: The quote ""it's natural to be fond of the newest arrival"" highlights a human tendency to favor ""novelty"" over ""quality"" or ""merit."" 

Evaluating the options:
*   **A** focuses on how long something pleases, which isn't the primary focus of the soldier's active neglect of the better horse.
*   **B** discusses disaster and satisfaction with one's lot, which is irrelevant here.
*   **C** suggests beauty fades, but the story states the first horse is *still* beautiful and useful.
*   **D** mentions ""wicked men,"" which does not apply to the context of the horses.
*   **E** directly addresses the irony of the situation: the soldier provides more value and care to the horse that is ""less worthy"" while ignoring the one that ""truly deserves"" it due to its excellence.

A Kite saw him and exclaimed: 'You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no bus",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the fable step by step:

1.  **Analyze the Action:** The seagull, a bird that naturally lives near the sea, attempts to eat something beyond its capacity (a fish too large). This results in a physical injury that leads to its death.
2.  **Analyze the Kite's Commentary:** The kite (a bird of prey that typically hunts on land or in the air) criticizes the seagull, stating that it shouldn't have been looking for food in the sea at all.
3.  **Evaluate the options against the Classic Fable (Aesop):**
    *   The kite's argument is that the seagull stepped outside its natural ""sphere"" or ""business"" (though biologically incorrect for a seagull, the fable treats it as a transgression of roles).
    *   **Option A** (""Mind his own business"") suggests staying within one's own domain or lane. This aligns with the kite's moralizing.
    *   **Option B and E** are unrelated to the text.
    *   **Option C** touches on greed/gluttony, but the Kite's specific rebuke focuses on the *nature* of the business (sea vs. air).
    *   **Option D** refers to providing enemies with the means to destroy us, which doesn't fit here as the seagull destroyed itself by its own action.

In classic interpretations of Aesop’s fables, this specific story (*The Kite and the Seagull* or *The Seagull and the Kite*) is used to illustrate that one should stay within their own sphere of expertise or natural domain. The kite's observation—though harsh—is the vehicle for the moral: that trying to operate in a realm where one does not belong (or overreaching one's bounds) leads to ruin.

The most traditional moral associated with this specific fable is that every man should be content to mind his own business (and stay in his own element).

They urged one another to approach the river, but no one dared to get too close bec",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the characters' motivations:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of foxes is thirsty, but the river current is intimidatingly strong. They are all cautious.
2.  **The Action:** One fox decides to show off. Her motivation isn't just to drink, but to ""embarrass her fellow foxes"" and prove she is ""braver than the rest.""
3.  **The Consequence:** She leaps in and is immediately swept away by the current, unable to control her movement or return to the bank.
4.  **The Reaction:** To save face while being swept to her likely doom/displacement, she makes up an excuse (carrying a message to Miletus) to hide the fact that she has failed and is in danger.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) People get themselves into trouble because of their boasting:** This fits perfectly. The fox's desire to mock others and boast of her bravery led her to take a reckless risk that resulted in her being swept away.
*   **B) Greedy men...:** The story is about vanity/bravado, not financial greed.
*   **C) Boldness quenches the cautious thirst:** This contradicts the story; the bold fox didn't get to drink safely; she got swept away.
*   **D) Cautious bad neighbours...:** The fox who suffered was the boastful one, not the cautious ones.
*   **E) Caution is wise, but courage is needed...:** The story actually warns against the ""courage"" shown by the fox, which was actually reckless pride.

1.  **The Lion's Dilemma:** The lion wants to appear fair and just, but his natural predatory nature (his appetite) persists.
2.  **The First Trap:** He creates a ""no-win"" situation. He asks animals if his breath smells. Those who tell the truth (it smells bad) are killed. Those who lie/flatter him (it smells good) are killed. This demonstrates that no matter what the animals say, the outcome is the same because the ""judge"" (the lion) has a predetermined goal to eat them.
3.  **The Monkey's Case:** The monkey tries extreme flattery (""altar of the gods""). While this temporarily pauses the lion due to ""shame,"" the lion simply changes his tactics to achieve the same end.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The lion uses the ""orders"" of doctors to justify eating the monkey. The monkey’s flattery did not save him; it only delayed the inevitable. 

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This fits the outcome of the first group of animals (truth-tellers and liars both died) and the monkey (who tried a different verbal approach but died anyway). However, it focuses on the futility of the subjects' actions against a tyrant.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there are no ""old friends"" mentioned.
*   **C:** This describes the lion, but the story is more about the danger faced by the subjects regardless of their speech.
*   **D:** This describes the monkey as a fool, but the lion is the primary actor the story warns about.
*   **E:** This is the opposite of the story's cynical reality.

Looking closer at the source of this fable (often attributed to Phaedrus or Babrius), the core lesson is that for a person determined to do evil, no amount of honesty, silence, or flattery from the victim will change the outcome. In many classical translations of this specific fable (The Lion, the Monkey, and the Fox/other animals), the moral is specifically that **the penalty for truth and flattery is the same when dealing with a tyrant.**

morables_579,"A man bought a partridge and let him run loose in the house since he liked the bird very much. The partridge immediately started squawking his usual song, sauntering through every room in the house un",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the behavior of the characters and the conflict between them:

1.  **The Action:** A partridge is newly introduced to a household. He immediately begins to act as though he owns the place—squawking loudly, wandering through every room, and perching himself prominently.
2.  **The Conflict:** The weasel, a long-term resident of the house, confronts the bird. The weasel points out that despite having been born there and having a ""pedigree"" (the mouser-slayer), she remains quiet and respectful of the space.
3.  **The Lesson:** The weasel's rebuke focuses on the partridge's lack of humility and failure to respect the established order of the home he just entered. The partridge is acting with ""confident vanity"" and loud intrusion before he has earned his place or understood the customs of his new environment. In the context of Aesop’s fables (from which this is derived), being overly loud or boastful in a new environment is often a precursor to danger or social shaming.

*   **A** is the most fitting lesson: The story contrasts the quiet veteran (the weasel) with the loud newcomer (the partridge), teaching that one should observe and honor the environment they have just entered rather than making a spectacle of themselves.
*   **D** is also a strong candidate, as the partridge’s behavior is vain; however, the core of the weasel's argument is specifically about the *timing* and *status* of the partridge (being a newcomer), which points more directly to the etiquette of entering a household.

In traditional interpretations of this fable (often titled ""The Weasel and the Partridge""), the focus is on the newcomer who speaks too freely too soon.

morables_39,"A fox climbing up over a fence was about to slip and fall, so she reached out and grabbed hold of a bramble bush but the brambles scratched the soft padding of the fox's paws. Stung by the sharp pain,",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A fox is in trouble (falling) and instinctively reaches out to a bramble bush for support.
2.  **The Conflict:** The bramble bush, by its very nature, is covered in thorns. When the fox grabs it, the fox is injured.
3.  **The Dialogue:** The fox blames the bush for being cruel. The bush responds by pointing out its inherent nature: it is a plant that ""grabs"" or pricks everyone. It suggests the fox was foolish to expect a different outcome.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fox sought help from something that is naturally harmful/hostile. The story teaches that one should not be surprised when an entity acts according to its inherent character, especially if that character is known to be prickly or unkind.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The bramble is ""naturally unkind"" (thorns) and the fox was ""foolish"" to expect help (soft support) from it.
*   **B:** There is no boasting about prowess in this story.
*   **C:** While cruelty is mentioned, the core of the fable is about the Fox's misguided expectation, not just the sensation of pain.
*   **D:** This references a different Aesop fable (""The Fox and the Cat"").
*   **E:** This is a plausible secondary lesson, but Aesop’s Fables typically focus on the folly of the victim's choice in character judgment (the nature of the ""enemy"").

The traditional moral of this fable (Aesop's *The Fox and the Bramble*) is that it is foolish to seek help from those who are known for causing harm.

But the fuller told him, 'How on earth would I be able to carr",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the roles of the two characters:
1.  **The Charcoal Burner:** His profession involves soot, smoke, and blackening materials.
2.  **The Fuller:** His profession involves cleaning, whitening, and purifying cloth.

The Fuller realizes that if they live together, the nature of the Charcoal Burner’s work will inevitably ruin the results of his own work. No matter how hard the Fuller works to make things white, the soot will make them black again. 

This fable illustrates that certain natures, interests, or ways of life are so fundamentally different that they cannot coexist without one ruining the other. It warns against forming partnerships with those whose basic habits or livelihoods are at odds with one's own.

- **Choice A** (""Opposites are utterly incompatible"") directly reflects the impossibility of the two men sharing a home because their fundamental natures (making things black vs. making things white) counteract each other. 
- **Choice B** is incorrect as there is no deception involved.
- **Choice C and D** contain wordplay about ""cleaning"" but do not accurately reflect the lesson regarding incompatible lifestyles.
- **Choice E** is a modern sentiment, but the classic Aesop moral focuses on the inherent incompatibility of their trades.

In many classical translations of Aesop's fables, the moral of ""The Charcoal-Burner and the Fuller"" is explicitly stated as: *""Like will draw to like""* or *""Distinguish what is incompatible.""*

morables_446,"A robber had murdered someone along the road. When the bystanders began to chase him, he dropped the bloody corpse and ran away. Some travellers coming from the opposite direction asked the man how he",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Action:** A murderer attempts to hide his guilt by lying to travelers, claiming his bloody hands are merely stained from climbing a mulberry tree.
2.  **The Consequence:** The murderer is caught by his pursuers and executed specifically on a mulberry tree.
3.  **The Dialogue:** The mulberry tree speaks at the end, expressing no remorse for its role in the execution because the man tried to shift the blame (the ""stain"" of the crime) onto the tree.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core of the fable is the relationship between the slanderer (the murderer) and the victim of the slander (the tree). The tree, which represents a neutral or ""honest"" entity, actively participates in the punishment of the person who tried to dishonor it by using it as a scapegoat.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A** highlights that even ""honest people"" (or entities, like the tree) will not hesitate to persecute/punish those who have slandered them or tried to involve them in their guilt. This aligns perfectly with the tree's final speech.
*   **B** refers to equanimity (stoicism), which is not the focus.
*   **C** mentions curiosity, but the travelers' curiosity was not what caught him; his pursuers did.
*   **D** discusses greed and honor, which are not the primary themes here.
*   **E** is a modern adage about truth, but doesn't capture the ""retribution"" aspect of the tree's role.

In traditional Aesopic collections, this fable (Perry Index 170) is titled ""The Murderer and the Mulberry Tree,"" and the moral is centered on the idea that those who are slandered will eventually see the slanderer punished, often by the very means they used for their deception.

The lion woke up and immediately grabbed the wretched little mouse with his paw,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events:

1.  **The Context:** A powerful creature (the lion) spares a weak creature (the mouse). The lion believes the mouse is too insignificant to offer him any ""glory"" or benefit, but he chooses to be merciful anyway.
2.  **The Turning Point:** The powerful lion finds himself in a situation where his strength is useless (trapped in a hunter's net).
3.  **The Resolution:** The small mouse, whom the lion previously helped, uses his specific skills (gnawing) to save the lion.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story demonstrates that a small act of mercy can yield a life-saving reward later on. It emphasizes that no one is so powerful that they might not one day need help from the weak, and no one is so small that they cannot show gratitude or be useful.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted:** This perfectly captures the reciprocity of the story and the value of the lion's initial mercy.
*   **B) Unequal matches bring misery:** Incorrect; the ""unequal"" match here resulted in mutual benefit.
*   **C) Cleverness can free the trapped:** While true, it misses the thematic focus on mercy and gratitude.
*   **D) Those who act in their own innocent self-interest...:** Incorrect; the mouse was genuinely helping out of gratitude.
*   **E) Even the smallest actions can awaken great consequences:** While somewhat relevant to the mouse running over the lion, it is too vague and misses the ""kindness"" and ""mercy"" themes central to Aesop's fables.

1.  **The Threat:** The Pigeons are afraid of a Kite (a medium-sized bird of prey).
2.  **The Solution:** They seek protection from a Hawk (a larger, more powerful predator) to drive away the Kite.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Hawk enters their home and kills more pigeons in a single day than the Kite would have killed in an entire year.

**Analysis of the Lessons:**
*   The Pigeons sought a ""remedy"" for their Kite problem, but the remedy (the Hawk) proved to be far more destructive than the original threat.
*   While option **E** touches on choosing allies wisely, the core traditional moral of this specific Aesop's fable (*The Pigeons and the Hawk*) emphasizes that the solution chosen was more dangerous than the problem itself. 
*   Option **A** (""Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease"") is the classic interpretation of this fable. It highlights that in the attempt to escape a minor danger, one should not invite a much greater catastrophe.

The story warns that we must be careful not to create a situation more harmful than the one we are trying to fix.

morables_394,"When Zeus had fashioned man and woman, he ordered Hermes to take them to Gaia, the Earth, and to show them how to obtain food by digging in the ground. At first, the Earth refused to cooperate in Herm",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Directive:** Zeus creates humans and tasks Hermes with teaching them how to survive by farming (digging in the Earth).
2.  **The Resistance:** Gaia (the Earth) initially refuses to allow humans to dig into her.
3.  **The Compulsion:** Hermes uses the authority of Zeus to force Gaia to comply.
4.  **The Consequence:** Gaia yields but attaches a heavy price. She warns that while humans can take sustenance from her, the process of laboring for food will be marked by ""groans and tears"" (physical toil and suffering).

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Easy gains often come with hidden costs and hardships.** The story illustrates that the ""gain"" of food from the earth is not free or easy; it requires painful labor and sacrifice.
*   **B) Do not fight with those who are perfectly capable of fighting back.** While Gaia is ""fighting"" back through her curse, the core of the story is about the nature of human labor, not a warning against picking fights.
*   **C) Power can sway the reluctant.** While Hermes sways Gaia with Zeus's power, this is a plot point rather than the ""moral"" or the ultimate lesson of the ending.
*   **D) Powerful physical stature does not guarantee commanding wisdom.** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **E) Guidance is the seed of self-sufficiency.** While Hermes provides guidance, the story focuses on the hardship of the task rather than the success of self-sufficiency.

This fable (often attributed to Aesop or found in the Babrius collection) serves as an origin myth for why agriculture is difficult. It explains that because the Earth was forced to yield, she ensures that humanity pays for their survival through arduous work.

The butcher turned around and said to him, 'You haven't stolen my heart; indeed, I have taken heart from this lesson! So if you eve",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Event:** A dog successfully steals a piece of meat (the heart of an animal) from a butcher shop.
2.  **The Butcher's Reaction:** Instead of simply being angry or mourning the loss, the butcher reflects on the event. He uses a play on words, noting that while the dog took a physical heart, the butcher ""took heart"" (meaning he gained courage, wisdom, or a hardening of resolve) from the experience.
3.  **The Lesson:** The butcher explicitly states that he has learned a lesson from this theft. He is now aware of the dog's behavior and will be prepared (with a ""reward,"" i.e., punishment) if the dog attempts it again.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Experience teaches valuable lessons and encourages caution:** This aligns perfectly with the butcher's dialogue. He acknowledges he learned from the experience and will be more cautious/prepared in the future.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** While the dog acted according to its nature, the focus of the fable's conclusion is on the butcher's acquired wisdom.
*   **C) Boldness without caution leads astray:** This focuses on the dog, but the dog actually succeeded in the theft; the ""lead astray"" part hasn't happened yet.
*   **D) Better to face a bold, known danger...:** This is the moral for a different fable (The Kid and the Wolf).
*   **E) Desire can lead to actions that betray trust:** There was no established trust between a stray dog and a butcher.

The core of the story is the butcher's realization and his preparation for the future based on a past event.

1.  **Analyze the Conflict:** The story presents a contrast between a young, idle bullock and an old, hard-working bull. The bullock mocks the bull for his toil, believing his own life of leisure is superior.
2.  **Analyze the Turn of Events:** The situation reverses during the sacrificial rite. The hard-working bull is released and rewarded with pasture, while the idle bullock—who was kept ""unburdened"" only to be fattened up—is led to slaughter.
3.  **Identify the Underlying Message:** The bullock's initial ""triumph"" or superiority was premature and based on a lack of understanding of the consequences of his idleness. The bull, who endured hardship originally, ends up in a safe and favorable position at the end.
4.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A) He laughs best that laughs last:** This fits the structure of the story perfectly. The bullock laughed first (mocked the bull), but the bull had the final, ""better"" laugh because he survived while the bullock faced a grim fate.
    *   **B) The great do not always prevail:** This doesn't apply; the ""great"" (the hard-working bull) actually did prevail in terms of survival.
    *   **C) Wisdom tempers youthful naivety:** While true, this is a general observation rather than the central moral regarding the reversal of fortunes. 
    *   **D) He that is neither...:** This is nonsensical in the context of the story.
    *   **E) One should not judge others...:** This is a plausible lesson, but the core of the fable is the irony of the bullock's fate compared to his initial mockery.

**Conclusion:** The traditional moral attached to this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Bull and the Bullock"") is that idleness often leads to a quick end, while hard work leads to security, encapsulated by the proverb ""He laughs best who laughs last.""

A man who was planning to make such a voyage had brought his monkey along with him,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the outcome:

1.  **The Situation:** A monkey is saved from a shipwreck by a dolphin who mistakes him for a human.
2.  **The Pretense:** During the rescue, the monkey begins to lie to impress the dolphin. He claims to be from a prestigious Athenian family.
3.  **The Mistake:** When asked about Piraeus (a famous harbor), the monkey mistakenly assumes it is a person and claims he is ""near and dear friends"" with him.
4.  **The Consequence:** The dolphin realizes the monkey is lying and a fraud. Disgusted by the deception, the dolphin stops helping and allows the monkey to drown (or actively kills him).

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The monkey ""pretended to be what he was not"" (an Athenian aristocrat/friend of Piraeus). He literally and figuratively ended up ""in deep water"" (drowned) because of his lies.
*   **B:** The story is about one-on-one interaction and deception, not comparing an individual's goodness to a crowd.
*   **C:** The monkey's plan was to lie, which caused infuriation, not calmed it.
*   **D:** While truth/lies are central, this phrasing is semantically awkward and less precise than A.
*   **E:** The companionship failed specifically because the monkey was dishonest; it was not a source of strength.

The fable serves as a warning against boasting and lying to impress others, as those lies are eventually exposed and lead to ruin.

Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable ""The Cat and the Mice,"" let's analyze the story step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Mice are in danger because the Cat is eating them. To protect themselves, they change their behavior and stay in their holes (becoming cautious).
2.  **The Deception:** The Cat, unable to reach the Mice through force, attempts to use ""cunning"" or a ""device."" She pretends to be dead (or looks like a bag of meal) to trick them into coming out.
3.  **The Result:** The Mice do not fall for the trick. One Mouse explicitly states that even if she turned into a meal-bag, they would not approach. This is because they have already experienced her true nature and have been ""deceived"" or harmed by her presence before.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Mice have learned from their past experiences. Because they know the Cat is a predator who has tried to kill them, they are now ""doubly cautious"" and refuse to trust even a seemingly harmless or dead appearance.

Looking at the options:
- **A) He who is once deceived is doubly cautious.** This perfectly matches the Mouse's refusal to trust the Cat after knowing her true nature.
- **B)** There is no collaboration between powerful/deceitful entities here.
- **C)** While the Mice's caution defeats the Cat's cunning, (A) is the classic wording associated with this Aesop fable, focusing on the wisdom gained from previous experience.
- **D)** There are no subordinates in this story.
- **E)** This describes the Cat's arrival, but not the climax/lesson regarding the Mice's survival.

1.  **The Situation:** A traveler, through his own exhaustion and lack of awareness, chooses to sleep on the edge of a dangerous well.
2.  **The Intervention:** Dame Fortune (the personification of luck or fate) wakes him up, not out of pure altruism, but to protect her own reputation.
3.  **The Message:** Fortune explicitly states that when humans face calamities due to their ""own folly,"" they tend to blame ""Fate"" or ""Luck"" rather than taking responsibility for their own poor decisions.
4.  **Conclusion:** The story emphasizes that people are responsible for the outcomes of their actions. While we often attribute misfortune to bad luck, it is usually a result of our own choices or negligence.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Everyone is more or less master of his own fate:** This aligns perfectly with the idea that our own ""folly"" or wisdom dictates our outcomes, and we shouldn't blame external ""Fortune.""
*   **B) Every tale is not to be believed:** Irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C) Guard your energy wisely:** While the man was tired, the story is about the consequences of where he chose to rest and the blame shift that follows, not the management of energy.
*   **D) He who incites to concerned strife...:** This is a moral typically associated with different fables (like The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner).
*   **E) Exhaustion can lead to perilous oversight:** This is a literal observation of the plot, but not the overarching *moral lesson* regarding responsibility and Fortune.

The man took the handle and fitted it to his axe. The",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Request:** A man creates the head of an axe (a tool of destruction for trees) but cannot use it without a handle. He asks his potential victims (the trees) for the means to complete his tool.
2.  **The Cooperation:** The trees, perhaps thinking a small gift would satisfy him or not realizing the consequences, provide him with the hardest wood (the wild olive) to serve as a handle.
3.  **The Result:** Armed with the completed axe, the man immediately uses the gift provided by the trees to destroy them.
4.  **The Realization:** The trees recognize that they provided the very instrument of their own destruction.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A:** This is a strong candidate, as the trees provided a tool to someone who intended to harm them.
*   **B:** This focuses on being ""injured with impunity,"" which doesn't quite fit the specific narrative of providing the weapon.
*   **C:** This is arguably the most precise summary. The trees were ""generous"" by giving the wood, but lacked the ""wisdom"" to see how that wood would be used against them, leading to ""regret.""
*   **D:** The trees were not ""forced"" (at least initially); they voluntarily ""selected"" the wood.
*   **E:** This does not fit the themes of betrayal or self-inflicted harm.

In the classic tradition of Aesop’s Fables, this story (often titled ""The Trees and the Axe"") is specifically categorized as a warning against being the architect of one's own destruction by helping an adversary. While A is close, **C** more accurately captures the internal failure of the trees (their lack of foresight/wisdom) that led to their downfall.

However, looking at standard interpretations of this specific fable, it serves as a warning that those who betray their own kind to help an enemy will be the first to suffer. Option A focuses on the act of offering to enemies, which is the core pivot of the story. Between A and C, A is often the most direct translation of the fable's traditional ""Epimythium.""

1.  **The Precept:** The mother crab gives her son a command (a precept) to walk straight, criticizing his natural behavior.
2.  **The Challenge:** The son asks for a demonstration, suggesting he will follow her example (""lead the way"").
3.  **The Failure:** The mother is unable to perform the action she demanded of her son.
4.  **The Lesson:** One cannot effectively teach or command someone to do something that they themselves cannot or do not do. Instruction is empty without a practical example to follow.

*   **A) Example is more powerful than precept:** This fits perfectly. A ""precept"" is a rule or instruction. The story shows that the mother's rule was useless because she could not provide the ""example.""
*   **B) Contentment...:** The story isn't about happiness or being satisfied with what one has.
*   **C) Those who cannot see the path...:** While it touches on guidance, the core conflict is about the hypocrisy of the teacher, not just getting lost.
*   **D) Hypocritical equals...:** The mother and son are not ""equals"" in a social sense, and ""best accusatory friends"" doesn't capture the pedagogical nature of the fable.
*   **E) Even the crooked can find their way...:** This is the opposite of what happened; the crab did not find his way.

morables_383,A wolf had assembled an immense store of booty in his den so that he could feast on all sorts of delicacies for months into the future. When the fox found out about this she paid a visit to the wolf a,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Wolf:** He is a thief who has hoarded ""booty"" (stolen goods). He is spiteful and rude to the fox, refusing to share or exhibit any social grace.
2.  **The Fox:** She is also a trickster. When rebuffed by the wolf, she betrays him to the shepherd out of spite. She then profits from the wolf's death by eating his stolen food.
3.  **The Outcome:** The wolf (a thief) is killed by the shepherd. The fox (who betrayed the thief to benefit herself) is eventually caught and killed by hunters.

The narrative arc follows the downfall of two ""villainous"" or predatory characters. The wolf is destroyed by the fox's treachery, and the fox is destroyed by her own nature/fate. In classical Aesopic fables, when two wrongdoers (like a wolf and a fox) cause each other's destruction or get caught in their own webs of deceit, the moral often reflects the satisfaction or justice found in thieves or villains destroying one another.

*   **A) Take pleasure when thieves destroy themselves:** This fits the narrative where both the wolf (a thief of flocks) and the fox (a deceptive scavenger) meet violent ends due to their own vices. 
*   **B) Never trust a known deceiver:** This is a secondary theme, but the story focuses more on the cycle of spite and the eventual death of both parties.
*   **C, D, E:** These either misinterpret the ending or focus on minor details rather than the ultimate fate of the characters.

Historically, this fable (found in collections like the *Ademar* or *Romulus* traditions) is titled ""The Wolf and the Fox"" and carries the moral that it is a joy to see the wicked perish by their own devices or through the betrayal of their peers.

But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; ,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the character interactions:

1.  **The Conflict:** An Eagle and a Serpent are locked in a life-and-death struggle.
2.  **The First Good Turn:** A countryman intervenes to help the Eagle, saving its life and allowing it to escape the Serpent’s coils.
3.  **The Act of Malice:** The Serpent poisons the countryman's drink in revenge for his interference.
4.  **The Second Good Turn (Reciprocity):** The Eagle, recognizing the man who saved him, intervenes just as the man is about to drink the poison. By knocking the horn out of the man's hand, the Eagle saves the man's life in return.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A) One good turn deserves another:** This fits perfectly. The man saved the Eagle, and the Eagle repaid the favor by saving the man. It is a story of mutual aid and gratitude.
- **B) Do not try to grasp too much at once:** This is the moral of ""The Boy and the Filberts,"" not applicable here.
- **C) Quick actions can be vengeful:** While the Serpent was vengeful, the focus of the story’s conclusion is the Eagle's protective response to the man's previous kindness.
- **D) Destroy the swift seed of vengeful evil...:** This moral is associated with a different fable (The Swallow and the Crow/The Hemp-seed).
- **E) Even the mighty must be wary...:** While true in some fables, the central theme here is the repayment of a favor.

The story illustrates that kindness is rewarded and that those who help others often receive help in their time of need.

morables_29,"A Rich Man gave a great feast, to which he invited many friends and acquaintances. His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, My master gives a feast, a",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Invitation:** A guest (the stranger Dog) is invited not by the host (the Rich Man), but by someone who does not have the actual authority to grant him a place at the table (the Master’s Dog).
2.  **The Intrusion:** The stranger Dog enters the house based on this unofficial invitation, behaving as if he belongs there while expecting to exploit the host's resources.
3.  **The Consequence:** The person with actual authority in the kitchen (the Cook) views the dog as an intruder rather than a guest and throws him out violently.
4.  **The Result:** Because the dog entered through unofficial/unauthorized means (""the back stairs""), he suffered a humiliating and painful exit (""out of the window"").

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A)** accurately reflects the lesson that those who try to benefit from a situation through unofficial or improper channels (the ""back stairs"") should not be surprised when they are treated as trespassers and ejected forcefully.
- **B)** is incorrect because the dogs were friends, not enemies.
- **C) and E)** focus on generosity, but the story is actually a cautionary tale about the lack of a true invitation.
- **D)** refers to ""promises of safety,"" which does not quite fit the context of a feast.

The traditional moral associated with this Aesop’s fable (""The Rich Man and the Two Dogs"") is that one should not rely on invitations from those who are not the masters of the house.

morables_707,"There was a certain miserly man who was dying and about to part with his enormous heap of money, ill-gotten as it was. He ordered that the bag of coins be brought to him as he was dying and then asked",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the narrative elements:

1.  **The Character:** A ""miserly man"" who has accumulated an ""enormous heap of money"" through ""ill-gotten"" means. This establishes a theme of greed and unethical gain.
2.  **The Situation:** On his deathbed, he realizes he cannot take his wealth with him and asks who will benefit from it.
3.  **The Response:** The money bag reveals two outcomes:
    *   His heirs will waste the money on vice (meaning his ""sweat"" was for nothing).
    *   The demons will torment his soul (the spiritual consequence of his greed).

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) A life of greed and hoarding wealth leads to misery:** This is a strong candidate, as it captures the hollowness of the miser's life and his final realization.
*   **B) It is better by far to be governed by one chief, than by many:** This is irrelevant to the text provided.
*   **C) Ill-gotten gains bring eternal torment:** This specifically addresses the ""ill-gotten"" nature of the wealth and the mention of ""demons"" and ""eternal torments"" in the text.
*   **D) Even beneficial things all appear to be enormous...:** This is a moral typically associated with a different fable (The Fox and the Lion) and does not fit the dialogue here.
*   **E) The fruits of toil may not always yield the intended legacy:** While the heirs squandering the money fits this, it ignores the spiritual/moral warning regarding the ""ill-gotten"" nature of the wealth.

**Conclusion:**
While Option A is a general truth about misers, **Option C** is the most precise reflection of this specific fable's text. The story explicitly highlights that the money was ""ill-gotten"" and concludes with the specific fate of ""eternal torments"" for the soul. The dialogue is structured to warn the reader that dishonest wealth harms others (heirs) and destroys the owner's soul.

The city mouse finished his business in the country and by means of insistent inv,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Comparison of Lifestyles:** The story contrasts the life of a country mouse (simple, humble food like acorns) with that of a city mouse (abundant delicacies but surrounded by danger and humans).
2.  **The Conflict:** While the city mouse is accustomed to the danger (the ""familiar mouse hole""), the country mouse experiences extreme terror when a butler enters. The ""wealth"" of food comes at the cost of peace and safety.
3.  **The Resolution:** The country mouse decides that the high-quality food is not worth the fear. He explicitly states that he prefers his ""acorns"" as long as he is ""secure in his freedom"" (and by extension, his safety).
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A:** This directly matches the mouse's conclusion—a simple life free from worry is superior to a luxurious life filled with fear.
    *   **B:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific trade-off between luxury and peace depicted in the fable.
    *   **C:** This describes the city mouse's survival but ignores the central lesson learned by the country mouse.
    *   **D:** This is a proverb related to betrayal, which does not occur in this story.
    *   **E:** This is a description of the plot, not a moral lesson.

The story teaches that peace of mind and safety are more valuable than luxury and abundance.

The beetle then felt contem",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative arc:

1.  **Preparation/Context**: The beetle lives in a dung heap but becomes dissatisfied after seeing an eagle.
2.  **The Conflict (Hubris)**: The beetle feels contempt for his own nature and falsely equates his value and abilities with the eagle's (""my voice is no less pleasant,"" ""her sheen does not outshine my own""). He decides to abandon his ""way of life"" to ""consort with the birds.""
3.  **The Action**: He attempts to fly like an eagle but fails because he cannot endure the environment of the ""upper air"" (strong winds).
4.  **The Consequence**: He falls, is physically shaken, and finds himself far from home and facing starvation.
5.  **The Resolution/Realization**: He expresses regret for his arrogance and wishes only to return to his original humble station (the dung heap).

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A**: This matches the story perfectly. The beetle was ""arrogant"" and ""put on airs"" (claiming equality with the eagle). He failed to achieve his new status and ended up worse off than before (losing his ""former position"" and security).
*   **B**: This is the moral of a *different* Aesop fable (""The Eagle and the Beetle""), where the beetle gets revenge on the eagle for eating a hare. It does not apply here.
*   **C**: The story warns against leaving one's sphere, the opposite of embracing diversity to gain perspectives.
*   **D**: This focuses on violence/force, which is not present in this story.
*   **E**: While the beetle experiences wonder, the story is a cautionary tale about the disaster following that wonder, not an exaltation of it.

The story warns that those who pretend to be something they are not, or who arrogantly reach beyond their natural capacity, risk losing what they already have.

I can't decide what to do: my love of money and my innat",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the character's conflict and the outcome:

1.  **The Conflict:** The protagonist is described as a ""greedy coward."" He discovers a ""lion of gold."" While the object is made of a valuable material (gold), its form (a lion) inspires fear in him, despite it being an inanimate object.
2.  **The Internal Debate:** He explicitly states that his ""love of money"" and ""innate cowardice"" are at odds. He desires the wealth but is too afraid to approach the object to claim it. He views the gold as a ""treasure that offers no satisfaction"" because his fear prevents him from taking it.
3.  **The Resolution:** Instead of overcoming his fear to obtain the treasure himself, he decides to stay at a distance and send others to do the work.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that greed is hindered by cowardice. The protagonist possesses the opportunity for great wealth, but his character prevents him from actually benefiting from it or enjoying it. Even when presented with a ""gift of a god,"" it remains ""unwelcome"" because his fear creates a barrier between him and the utility of the wealth.

*   **Choice A** focuses on the utility of wealth being nullified by fear, which matches the protagonist's lament that the treasure ""offers no satisfaction.""
*   **Choice B** is irrelevant to the text.
*   **Choice C** is close, but the story suggests cowardice paralyzes the greedy rather than ""blinding"" them (he sees the gold clearly).
*   **Choice D** misinterprets the dynamic of the servants.
*   **Choice E** focuses on time, whereas the story focuses on the character flaw of cowardice preventing the enjoyment of riches.

The most traditional and accurate moral for this Aesop-style fable (often cataloged as ""The Coward and the Golden Lion"") is that riches are useless to those who are too afraid to lift a finger to claim or enjoy them.

When opinions were exchanged back and forth, the ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interaction between the hares and the lions:

1.  **The Context:** The animals assemble to address grievances. The hares, being physically vulnerable, propose a system of total equality and shared power so that the strong cannot prey upon the weak.
2.  **The Argument:** The hares argue for fairness and equal dignity based on moral and social ideals.
3.  **The Response:** The lions acknowledge that the hares' ideas sound good in theory (""Your words... are good""), but they point out a physical reality: the hares lack the ""claws and teeth"" to enforce such a system or back up their demands.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates that high ideals and demands for equality often hold little weight if the party making the demands lacks the power or means to enforce them. In a world governed by strength (the law of the jungle), a position is only as strong as one's ability to defend it. 

While the story might seem cynical, it emphasizes that ""good words"" are insufficient without the power to protect one's interests. Therefore, the lesson is that one must be prepared to defend their position or possess the leverage to make their demands a reality.

There was a whole crowd of monkeys there and one of them ,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the actions and consequences for each character:

1.  **The Liar:** He assesses the situation and realizes the monkey leader is vain (imitating an emperor). He uses flattery and lies to inflate the monkey's ego. As a result, he is rewarded because the monkey ""thrives"" on the deception that validates his self-importance.
2.  **The Truth-teller:** He assumes that truth is inherently more valuable than lies and will be rewarded accordingly. However, his honest assessment (""You are simply a monkey"") insults the leader's vanity.
3.  **The Reaction:** The monkey leader and his followers, having been ""fooled by flattery,"" do not want the truth; they want their illusion upheld. Therefore, they violently punish the one who speaks the truth.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the outcome. The monkeys (deceptive/vain) reward the liar and violently retaliate against the one who speaks the truth.
*   **B)** While the men's characters are distinct, the story is more about the consequences of their speech than the difficulty of knowing them.
*   **C)** While flattery does deceive the naive monkeys, the core ""moral"" of the story focuses on the dangerous fate of the truth-teller in a land of lies.
*   **D)** This is a different moral (often associated with Aesop's *The Fox and the Lion*), but it doesn't fit the violent ending here.
*   **E)** The story explicitly shows that truth is *not* a defense; it is actually a liability in this scenario.

The story serves as a cynical warning: in environments where vanity and deception are prized, the truth is not only unrewarded but actively punished.

This slave-woman, bedecked with gold and trailing a delicate purple robe aro",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** A man is infatuated with a woman described specifically as ""ugly"" and ""wicked."" He treats her as though she is superior to his own wife, providing her with luxuries.
2.  **The Slave-woman’s Delusion:** The slave-woman believes her success is due to her own beauty or the favor of Aphrodite (the goddess of beauty). She constantly prays to Aphrodite to thank her for these gifts.
3.  **The Divine Intervention:** Aphrodite appears and explicitly clarifies that she is *not* responsible for the woman’s ""beauty"" (because the woman isn't actually beautiful). Instead, Aphrodite expresses ""fury"" and disgust that the man is so deluded that he thinks an ugly/wicked woman is ""worth looking at.""

**Analysis of the Morals:**
*   **B, C, D, and E** focus on modern sensibilities: internal beauty, contentment, or generosity. However, the fable is classical (Aesopic), which often deals with the folly of human perception and the disdain of the gods for those who lack discernment.
*   The goddess's speech emphasizes that the man's attraction is irrational and offensive to the natural order of beauty. Aphrodite is angry that her domain (beauty) is being insulted by the man’s preference for something ugly.
*   This aligns with **Option A**: The story suggests that the man is ""out of his mind"" (deluded) and ""hated by the gods"" (because his tastes offend the goddess of beauty) for valuing what is objectively ugly and wicked.

In historical collections of Aesopic fables, this specific story (Perry 305) is traditionally used to show that those who mistake the base for the beautiful are acting under a divine or mental curse.

Aesop therefore shared this little story with the father,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the context and the conclusion of Aesop’s fable:

1.  **The Problem:** A father has a son with a ""vicious adolescent temper"" who is causing harm (whipping slaves) when unsupervised.
2.  **The Analogy:** A farmer yokes a wise, old bull to a violent, young bull. The purpose of the pairing isn't to increase the workload, but to use the old bull's stability and presence to ""check"" (restrain) the young bull's aggression.
3.  **The Lesson:** Aesop tells the father that he must keep the boy beside him so that the father's ""moderation"" can ""restrain"" the boy's ""reckless inclinations.""
4.  **The Result of Inaction:** If the father does not do this, the household will suffer even greater harm.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** While the ""moderation"" mentioned is a mild disposition, the core lesson emphasizes the active restraint of aggression through wisdom/moderation.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; the story is not about the feelings of old age.
*   **C:** This captures the farmer's strategy and Aesop's advice: the experienced, ""tempered"" party (the old bull/the father) acts as a stabilizing force to curb reckless aggression.
*   **D:** This is the moral of the Tortoise and the Hare, not this story.
*   **E:** While true, this is the *consequence* described at the end rather than the central *remedy* or lesson taught by the analogy of the bulls.

The moral focuses on the idea that the reckless and violent require the steadying influence of someone wiser and more moderate to keep them in check.

All the other passengers started to swim, but the Athenian kept praying to Athena, maki",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"Here is a step-by-step analysis of the fable's moral:

1.  **Analyze the characters' actions:** The Athenian man relies solely on divine intervention, praying and making promises to a goddess rather than physically attempting to save himself. In contrast, the other passengers are actively swimming to survive.
2.  **Identify the conflict:** The conflict is between passive reliance on external/supernatural help and active self-preservation.
3.  **Identify the climax/message:** The passenger who swims past gives the crucial advice: ""While you pray to Athena, start moving your arms!"" This implies that faith or prayer is not a substitute for personal action.
4.  **Synthesize the lesson:** The story teaches that one must help themselves before (or while) seeking help from others or the divine. This is a classic expression of the proverb ""God helps those who help themselves.""
5.  **Match to the options:** 
    *   **A) Self-effort is essential** directly aligns with the message that the man must ""move his arms"" to survive.

1.  **The Conflict:** Two rivals (the Frog and the Mouse) are so focused on their internal struggle for dominance over a small territory (the marsh) that they decide to engage in a ""fight to the death.""
2.  **The Distraction:** Their intense focus on each other blinds them to their surroundings. They are preoccupied with a ""fair and open combat"" over a prize.
3.  **The Outcome:** A third party (the Kite), who was not part of the rivalry, sees the opportunity created by their distraction and seizes both combatants.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A) When fools fight others run away with the prize:** This is a very common moral for this specific Aesop's fable. The ""fools"" (Frog and Mouse) are so busy fighting that the ""prize"" (themselves/their lives/the marsh) is taken by a third party.
- **B, C, and D:** These capture elements of the story (harming oneself, staying vigilant, or being observant), but they are not the primary lesson regarding the nature of the rivalry itself.
- **E) Rivalries can blind us to the greater dangers lurking nearby:** This is an excellent interpretation of the theme; however, in the tradition of Aesop's fables, this specific story (The Frog and the Mouse) is most famously associated with the lesson that when two parties fight over a grievance, a third party often steps in to profit from their mutual destruction. 

In many classic collections of Aesop's fables, the moral provided for this story is: ""When fools fight, the forage (or prize) falls to the kite,"" or ""In the quarrels of the weak, the strong profit."" This aligns most closely with Option A.

The surviving daughter wondered to see strangers so much concerned at the loss of her sister, and he",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** A family has suffered a loss. The mother has hired professional mourners to attend the funeral.
2.  **The Observation:** The surviving daughter notices a discrepancy: the family (the kin) is relatively quiet, while total strangers are wailing and acting deeply distraught.
3.  **The Explanation:** The mother explains that the family’s grief is personal and doesn’t benefit from outward performance (""we... are never the better for crying""), whereas the strangers are performing because it is their job (""the strangers have money for it"").
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the transactional nature of hired labor versus genuine emotion. It points out that outward displays of emotion can be purchased, and those who appear the most concerned are often those with a financial incentive to do so.

*   **Option B, C, D, and E** do not fit: The story isn't about the goodness of individuals (B), the nature of curiosity (C), a compromise of integrity (D), or genuinely shared sorrow (E).
*   **Option A** accurately reflects the mother's explanation: the intense display of grief from the strangers is a professional service rendered for payment.

The fable explores the theme that ""Money makes the tongue speak,"" or that artificial displays are often bought. Among the choices provided, Option A is the most direct correlation to the mother's cynical but pragmatic point.

3.  **The Reason**: Truth explains that in the past, lies were rare and restricted to a few people. However, in the present time, lies have ""spread throughout all of human society.""
4.  **The Conclusion**: The presence of Truth is no longer tolerated or found in society because falsehood has become universal among men.

Evaluating the options:
- **A) Falsehood is with all men**: This aligns directly with Truth's statement that lies have spread through ""all of human society,"" making it impossible for her to remain there.
- **B, C, D, E**: These options discuss pride, curiosity, the nature of beneficial things, or compassion. None of these themes are addressed in Truth's explanation for her exile.

The story serves as a cynical commentary on the state of honesty in the world, suggesting that deception is now a character trait found everywhere.

As the ox stru",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation:** Two animals (an ox and a donkey) are tasked with sharing a single load.
2.  **The Conflict:** The ox exerts himself despite an injury, while the donkey refuses to help.
3.  **The Consequence (Part 1):** Because the donkey did not share the burden, the ox died from overexertion.
4.  **The Consequence (Part 2):** The donkey is then forced to carry the weight of the original load plus the heavy carcass of the ox. This combined weight kills the donkey.
5.  **The Lesson:** The birds explicitly state that if the donkey had helped the ox initially, he would have lived.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This matches the plot perfectly. The donkey’s refusal to help his ""neighbor"" (the ox) led to the neighbor's ""fall"" (death), which resulted in the neighbor's ""burden"" (the ox's own weight and the original load) falling onto the donkey.
*   **B:** While the ending was bad, the story focuses more on cooperation and shared responsibility than on the general concept of ""endings.""
*   **C:** Hard work did not triumph here; everyone died.
*   **D:** This is vague. While true, it doesn't capture the relational aspect of the failure to help.
*   **E:** The story isn't just about personal strength; it’s about the logical consequence of selfishness in a shared task.

The story illustrates that by refusing to share a burden, one often ends up bearing a much heavier one alone.

1.  **Analyze the Premise:** The fable explains why ""modesty"" was added to humanity as an afterthought rather than being built into our internal composition at creation. 
2.  **Analyze the Conflict:** Modesty is hesitant to be released into the world. Her hesitation is resolved only when she sets a specific condition or rule for her behavior.
3.  **Identify the Core Condition:** The text states that Modesty agrees to exist among humans only ""upon condition that carnal love might not be suffered to come into the same company.""
4.  **Determine the Consequence:** Modesty explicitly states her boundary: ""for wherever that [carnal love] comes, says she, I'm gone.""
5.  **Conclusion:** The central point of the story is the mutual exclusivity of modesty and carnal love (lust/passion). When one enters, the other departs.

The fox then said to ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Action:** A monkey and a fox are traveling through a cemetery.
2.  **The Lie:** The monkey makes a grand, boastful claim about his lineage, asserting that the dead people buried there were his ancestors' freedmen (servants).
3.  **The Context:** The monkey chooses this specific location because the ""witnesses"" (the dead) are physically incapable of speaking up to correct him.
4.  **The Observation:** The fox points out the convenience of the monkey's lie. He notes that the monkey is only being so bold because he knows no one present can refute his claims.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This directly addresses the fox's point. The monkey ""exploits the inability"" of the dead to ""challenge his falsehoods."" If the monkey had made this claim about living people, they could have corrected him.
*   **B:** There is no mention of old friends vs. new acquaintances.
*   **C:** While the monkey is deceptive, the specific lesson centers on the *opportunity* provided by those who cannot defend the truth.
*   **D:** The monkey does not find himself in ""deep water"" (trouble) in this specific fable; he is merely called out by the fox.
*   **E:** While they are on a shared path, the story focuses specifically on the nature of the boast, not the journey itself.

The fable teaches that boastful liars often choose subjects or situations where their claims cannot be verified or contradicted.

1.  **The Action**: A Farmer shows compassion to a suffering creature (a frozen Snake) and saves its life by warming it.
2.  **The Reaction**: Once revived, the Snake follows its ""natural instincts"" and bites the Farmer, killing him.
3.  **The Reflection**: The Farmer realizes his mistake was pitying a ""scoundrel""—an entity that is inherently dangerous or malicious regardless of the kindness shown to it.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.** This aligns perfectly with the story. No matter how much kindness (saving its life) the Farmer showed, it did not change the Snake’s nature or make it feel obligated to act with gratitude.
*   **B) The man who treats others well is rewarded by gratitude.** The story explicitly contradicts this; the Farmer is rewarded with death.
*   **C) Gratitude prevents regret.** The story is about the absence of gratitude leading to a fatal outcome.
*   **D) Injuries may be regretfully forgiven, but not ungratefully forgotten.** This focuses on the victim's forgiveness, whereas the fable focuses on the folly of helping the wicked.
*   **E) Even in the coldest times, a touch of compassion can revive what seems lost.** While literal, it misses the cautionary point of the fable, which is that reviving something dangerous is a mistake.

The fable (Aesop’s ""The Farmer and the Viper"") teaches that kindness shown to evil-doers is thrown away and that some natures cannot be changed by even the greatest acts of mercy.

1.  **The Context:** The blacksmiths are engaged in loud, productive work (hammering). The dog ignores this noise entirely and sleeps, showing that he is indifferent to the labor or the welfare of the household.
2.  **The Conflict:** As soon as the sound of eating occurs—a sound much quieter than a hammer—the dog wakes up and becomes attentive.
3.  **The Lesson:** The blacksmiths highlight the dog’s selective hearing. The dog isn't bothered by the loud noise of work because it doesn't benefit him, but he is instantly alert to the quiet noise of food because it serves his self-interest.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This directly matches the narrative. The dog is ""inattentive"" to the work (hammers) but ""quickly notices"" the benefit (food).
*   **B:** This refers to agency and responsibility, which is not the focus here.
*   **C:** While the blacksmiths are diligent and the dog is opportunistic, the story focuses more on the dog's selective perception/awareness rather than a competition between the two traits.
*   **D:** There is no ""tyrant"" in this story.
*   **E:** The dog isn't harmonizing; he is sleeping through work and waking for a meal.

The fable (often attributed to Aesop) is intended to criticize those who are lazy when it comes to work but alert when it comes to rewards.

He greeted the unicorn and said to him, 'Let us put aside all that we have done in the past, because I am no ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Setup:** The lion and the unicorn are established as ""chief enemies.""
2.  **The Deception:** The lion feigns weakness, old age, and sickness to gain sympathy. He uses a humble and supplicating tone to ask for the unicorn's horn (his primary defense) under the guise of needing a walking stick.
3.  **The Error:** The unicorn allows pity to override caution and hands over his defense, rendering himself vulnerable.
4.  **The Betrayal:** Once the unicorn is defenseless, the lion immediately attacks him.
5.  **The Exchange of Philosophy:** The unicorn laments the treachery and the loss of honor, while the lion justifies his actions by stating that mercy toward an enemy is a weakness.

While Option E reflects the unicorn's closing argument about honorable victory, fables often focus on the practical warning or the mistake made by the protagonist. The core of the tragedy is the unicorn's decision to trust a known enemy who is behaving in a way that contradicts his nature (a lion acting humble and weak).

**Option A** is the most comprehensive moral for this specific fable: It warns never to trust an enemy, specifically highlighting that one should remain protected even when the enemy appears ""humble and supplicating."" This directly addresses the lion's tactic and the unicorn's fatal mistake.

But being the ruler of the freshwater wasn't enough for him; he wanted to rule the sea too. With t",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** The Master-Pike is already the ""Prince of the River,"" possessing size, beauty, and strength. He is at the top of his specific domain.
2.  **The Conflict:** He becomes dissatisfied with his ""lot"" (his current status and territory) and ambitiously attempts to conquer a realm (the sea) where he does not belong and where his strengths are overshadowed by others (the Dolphin).
3.  **The Resolution:** He is humbled and chased back to his original home, narrowly escaping with his life.
4.  **The Lesson:** He learns to stay within his own territory and be satisfied with his natural position.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Be content with your lot:** This directly addresses the Pike's dissatisfaction with his river kingdom and his subsequent realization that he should have stayed where he belonged.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you...:** The story doesn't focus on the opinions of others, but rather the physical reality of power dynamics.
*   **C) Strength without humility...:** While true, the core of the story is about boundaries and contentment rather than just a lack of humility.
*   **D) Ambitious counsel without mighty help...:** This is a classic Aesop-style moral, but the Pike acted alone; there was no ""counsel"" involved.
*   **E) True leadership...:** The story is about territory and ambition, not the quality of his leadership skills.

1.  **The Conflict:** Two soldiers are attacked. One flees (cowardice), while the other fights (bravery).
2.  **The Aftermath:** Once the danger has passed, the coward returns, making grand boasts and brandishing his weapon as if he were ready to fight.
3.  **The Response:** The brave soldier rebukes him, pointing out that while the coward's words are bold now, his actions during the actual danger proved he is unreliable. He emphasizes that ""prowess"" and ""courage"" are measured by actions in the heat of the moment, not by words spoken after the fact.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Courage in words means nothing if you flee in danger:** This directly addresses the contrast between the coward's boastful speech and his earlier flight. It captures the essence of the brave soldier's rebuke.
*   **B) There is little risk in being poor...:** This is irrelevant to the plot of this specific fable.
*   **C) Bravery outshines cowardice:** While true, it is too general and doesn't capture the specific lesson about empty boasting.
*   **D) Know your aggressive, unreliable enemies:** The story is about a companion/friend, not an enemy.
*   **E) Courage in adversity reveals true character:** This is a strong lesson, but the fable focuses specifically on the hypocrisy of the coward's empty words after the event, which is most precisely captured by option A.

The primary lesson focuses on the vanity of boasting after a crisis has passed when one failed to act during the crisis itself.

1.  **The Situation:** The Eagle (the king of birds) honors the Hoopoe by giving it a seat above other guests during a wedding.
2.  **The Reasoning:** The Hoopoe is chosen for this honor based solely on its outward appearance—its ""crown"" and ""multicolored feathers.""
3.  **The Conflict/Irony:** The other birds resent this because they know the Hoopoe’s true nature and habits. Despite its beautiful exterior, it ""spends all its time rolling around in dung and filth.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the gap between physical beauty (outward appearance) and actual habits or character (inner worth). It suggests that honoring someone based on superficial traits is a mistake when their underlying character is ignoble.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A)** Aligns perfectly with the themes of the story. The Hoopoe has the outward appearance of nobility but lacks the character to match.
*   **B)** This is the moral of ""The Eagle and the Beetle,"" but it does not apply here as there is no act of revenge.
*   **C)** While the birds feel resentment, the story focuses more on *why* the resentment is justified (the mismatch of appearance and reality).
*   **D)** The Hoopoe is not noted for kindness; it is noted for filth.
*   **E)** The story actually describes a breakdown in community feeling due to perceived injustice in hierarchy.

The story teaches that superficial beauty (the crown and feathers) should not be mistaken for true worth if the individual's actions (rolling in dung) are dishonorable.

1.  **The Action:** A hen (symbolizing a well-meaning but naive creature) finds snake eggs. Instead of destroying them, she nurtures them and broods over them as if they were her own.
2.  **The Nature of the Subject:** Snakes are naturally venomous and predatory. By helping them hatch, the hen is nurturing a creature that is inherently dangerous to her.
3.  **The Warning:** The swallow points out the hen's folly. Once the snakes hatch, their nature (wickedness/predation) will not be changed by the hen’s kindness; instead, they will follow their instincts and kill the hen and others.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) We should never put our trust in a wicked man...:** This aligns perfectly with the fable. The hen trusts that her maternal care will yield a positive result, but she is actually facilitating her own destruction by ignoring the ""wicked"" nature of the snakes.
*   **B) People who grasp at more than they need...:** This relates to greed (like the dog and its reflection), which is not the theme here.
*   **C) Devotion can avert danger:** The story teaches the exact opposite.
*   **D) He who senselessly competes with his superiors...:** There is no competition or social climbing in this story.
*   **E) Compassion can transcend natural boundaries:** While the hen attempts this, the fable is a cautionary tale warning that such compassion is ""senseless"" and fatal.

In Aesop's fables, this specific story (The Hen and the Snake) is intended to show that kindness shown to the wicked is a lost cause and will eventually be repaid with harm.

1.  **The Situation:** A jackdaw is captured and kept as a pet (a ""slave""). While he is safe and fed, he lacks freedom.
2.  **The Action:** The bird attempts to regain his freedom by escaping.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he is still dragging the string from his captivity, he becomes entangled in his own home and dies.
4.  **The Realization:** In his final moments, the bird reflects on the fact that his dissatisfaction with his ""condition"" (being a pet) led him to a reckless escape that resulted in his death. He realizes that by trying to escape a safe—albeit restricted—life, he brought about his own destruction.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This option suggests that our internal perspective and how we handle our circumstances (the ""mind"") dictate our outcome and happiness. The jackdaw’s refusal to accept his condition led him to a choice that ended his life.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there are no themes of pity or tears.
*   **C:** Irrelevant; generosity is not a core theme here.
*   **D:** While the children were innocent, the story focuses on the bird's own choice and the resulting irony of his death.
*   **E:** While true in a general sense, the story's climax is not about the children's lack of appreciation, but the bird's tragic quest for liberty at the cost of his life.

In many classical interpretations of this Aesop fable (*The Jackdaw and the String*), the moral is that in seeking to flee a minor discomfort or a state of ""slavery,"" one may run into a far worse fate (death). However, among the choices provided, **Option A** best captures the philosophical root: the bird's inability to reconcile his mind with his condition led to his downfall.

'Be careful, my friends,' he said, 'what if we all drown before the me",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** A group of sailors is in a life-threatening storm. They are attempting to seek divine intervention but are doing so through intermediaries (various saints).
2.  **The Sailor's Argument:** One sailor points out a practical flaw in their method: efficiency. He suggests that using messengers (saints) creates a delay or a risk that the message won't arrive in time during an emergency.
3.  **The Solution:** He advises going ""directly to the one who can save us without any help"" (God). This removes the middleman and creates a direct line of communication.
4.  **The Result:** They follow this advice, and the storm calms.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) The shortest and surest way of doing things is best.** This directly aligns with the sailor's logic. By bypassing the intermediaries and going straight to the source of power, the sailors chose the most efficient and direct route to their goal.
*   **B) It is better to be loved than feared.** This is a common moral from other fables (like Machiavelli or Aesop), but it is irrelevant to this story.
*   **C) Mercy tempers power.** While the storm stopping could be seen as mercy, the story focuses on the *method* of the prayer rather than the character of the deity.
*   **D) Not all pragmatic advice is diverse or wise.** Usually, the advice in these fables is presented as wise; the sailor's advice saved them.
*   **E) Urgency in communication is vital.** This is a component of the story, but ""A"" provides a more comprehensive moral about the efficiency of direct action versus bureaucratic or indirect steps.

The story teaches that instead of relying on subordinates or intermediaries, it is most effective to go straight to the person in charge. This is a classic Aesopic moral.

The mice who lived in the house were always being hunted down by either the snake or the weasel, so when they saw the snake and the ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Conflict:** Two powerful predators (the snake and the weasel) are fighting.
2.  **The Miscalculation:** The mice (the weaker party) observe the fighting and assume they are safe to come out because the predators are distracted.
3.  **The Outcome:** The predators immediately set aside their differences to prey upon the easier, common target.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A)** While the mice are bystanders who suffer, the story specifically highlights that they placed themselves in danger by misjudging the situation.
- **B)** This is too broad and doesn't capture the power dynamic.
- **C)** The mice were not timid; they were adventurous/reckless, and they did not ""outwit"" the aggressors.
- **D)** In many classical collections of Aesop’s Fables, this story (often titled ""The Snake, the Weasel, and the Mice"") is used to warn that common enemies will often unite to destroy weaker parties who let their guard down. The mice felt ""safe"" during the conflict, but their safety was an illusion. They were not ""ready to face an opportunistic enemy"" once the fight shifted.
- **E)** This focuses on the house, whereas the fable focuses on the fate of the inhabitants.

The core lesson is that one should never assume safety just because enemies are fighting each other; a common interest (prey) can turn former combatants into a united front against the unwary. Option A captures the essence of the ""bystander"" (the mice) suffering due to the shifting focus of the powerful parties. However, in traditional interpretations of this fable, the moral is most closely aligned with the idea that those who intervene or expose themselves during the quarrels of the powerful often become their common prey.

Between the options, **A** is the most accurate reflection of the narrative's logic: the mice (bystanders) were caught in the middle of a conflict between more powerful parties.

'Well!' said the Boy, 'you'll regret it, because you'll never be as well cared for any",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the core conflict:
1. **The situation:** A Goldfinch has escaped a life of security and comfort (being ""well cared for"" in a cage) for a life of uncertainty.
2. **The trade-off:** The Master (the Boy) argues that the bird is making a mistake because it is losing material comfort and safety.
3. **The bird's response:** The bird acknowledges that it might be less comfortable or well-fed, but it values the ability to ""take care of myself"" (autonomy/liberty) over being ""under your care"" (servitude/security).

Now let's evaluate the options:
- **A) There is no wealth greater than liberty:** This matches the bird's sentiment perfectly. Even though the Master offers ""wealth"" in the form of care and food, the bird views its freedom as more valuable.
- **B) You should not treat bad people the same way...:** This is irrelevant to the story's themes.
- **C) Defiance can mask true concern:** This misinterprets the characters' motivations.
- **D) Changing your independent location does not change your defiant state of mind:** This is a philosophical observation about travel/perspective, but it doesn't fit the context of liberation from a cage.
- **E) Freedom is a treasure worth pursuing, even at great risk:** While this is close, the story focuses specifically on the comparison between **material provision** and **self-governance**. Option A captures the specific comparison of material ""wellness/wealth"" versus the value of ""liberty.""

In traditional fables (like those by Aesop), this specific story highlights that freedom is preferable to even the most luxurious slavery.

The mole said to them, 'Silence your complaining, since you can see that I am deprived of eyes.'",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions between the characters step by step:

1.  **The Donkey and the Monkey:** Both characters are focused on minor physical deficiencies—the donkey wants horns and the monkey wants a tail. Their focus is on what they lack compared to an ideal or other animals.
2.  **The Mole's Intervention:** The mole interrupts them to point out a much more significant deprivation: the lack of sight.
3.  **The Lesson:** The mole's interjection serves to put the complaints of the donkey and the monkey into perspective. By comparing their superficial desires (horns and tails) to a fundamental loss (eyesight), the story suggests that our own misfortunes seem less severe when we consider the greater hardships faced by others.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the mole’s message. Seeing someone with a greater misfortune (blindness) should make the others realize their own situations are not so bad.
*   **B:** The story is about perspective and complaining, not about mutual aid or shared burdens.
*   **C:** While true in reality, the story specifically focuses on the comparison of misfortunes.
*   **D:** This is a description of karma or retribution, which does not fit this narrative.
*   **E:** The donkey and monkey aren't necessarily ""coveting"" specific items from others, but rather bemoaning their own state until they see a worse one.

Therefore, the story teaches us to find patience and gratitude by looking at the greater struggles of those around us.

morables_42,"A Fox invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his entertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out into a broad flat stone dish. The soup fell out of the long bill of the Cra",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The Fox plays a trick on the Crane by serving food in a flat dish that the Crane cannot use. The Fox is amused by the Crane's struggle.
2.  **The Crane's Reaction:** Instead of simply being a victim, the Crane replicates the Fox's behavior by inviting the Fox to a meal served in a vessel only suitable for a long neck (a flagon).
3.  **The Result:** The Fox experiences the same frustration she inflicted on the Crane. The text describes this as a ""fitting requital"" (getting what one deserves).

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) Do unto others what you would have them do unto you:** This is the ""Golden Rule."" The story illustrates the negative inverse: if you treat others poorly, you should expect to be treated poorly in return. This aligns perfectly with the ""fitting requital"" the Fox receives.
*   **B) Beware the sort of person who uses tricks:** While the Fox is a trickster, the story is more about the consequence of the trick rather than a warning to be cautious.
*   **C) Cleverness can outwit vexation:** This doesn't capture the reciprocal nature of the justice served.
*   **D) A clever alliance with the powerless is futile:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) Consideration for others' needs fosters true hospitality:** While true in a general sense, the story focuses on the retaliation and the ""eye for an eye"" nature of the Fox's comeuppance.

The fable traditionally teaches that one should treat others how they wish to be treated, or conversely, that those who play tricks should expect tricks in return.

Wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the persons in her father's house, he made some excuse to send her home o",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** A husband suspects his wife is disliked by everyone because of her behavior. He sends her to her father’s house to see if she behaves differently or is perceived differently elsewhere.
2.  **The Evidence:** Upon her return, the wife complains that even the shepherds and herdsmen—people who are out in the fields from dawn until dusk and barely saw her—treated her with aversion.
3.  **The Conclusion:** The husband concludes that if people who barely interacted with her (the ""straws"" or small indicators) disliked her, those who had to spend the entire day with her must have found her intolerable.
4.  **The Lesson:** Small signs or interactions can indicate a much larger truth or a general trend. If even the most peripheral people in a household dislike someone, it is a clear indicator of that person's character and how they are perceived by everyone else.

**Option Analysis:**
*   **A) Straws show how the wind blows:** This is a classic idiom meaning that small signs show the direction of a larger situation. If the ""small"" interactions (the shepherds) were bad, the ""large"" interactions (the household) must be worse. This aligns perfectly with the husband's logic.
*   **B), C), D), E):** These options either focus on friendship, respect, or curiosity, which are not the central logical point the husband makes regarding the evidence provided by the wife's experience.

The moral is that small indicators reveal the larger reality.

morables_693,"The coachman, hearing one of the wheels of his coach creak, was surprised; but more especially when he perceived that it was the worst wheel of the whole set, and which he thought had but little prete",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of this fable, let's analyze the story step by step:

1.  **The Event:** A wheel on a coach is creaking (making noise/complaining).
2.  **The Observation:** The coachman notices that it is not the strong wheels making the noise, but specifically the **""worst wheel of the whole set.""**
3.  **The Subtext:** In fables, a ""creaking wheel"" is a metaphor for complaining or making a fuss. The fact that the weakest, least effective wheel is the one making the most noise suggests that those who contribute the least or are in the worst condition are often the ones who complain the loudest.
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A) Complaining is the privilege of the weak:** This aligns with the irony noted by the coachman—the wheel least entitled to complain (because it is the ""worst"") is the one doing so. It captures the spirit of the ""Squeaky Wheel"" archetype in classical fables (like those of Aesop), where the weakest members of a group often make the most noise.
    *   **B, C, D:** These do not relate to the specific dynamic between the coachman and the poor-quality wheel.
    *   **E) Noise often masks vulnerability:** While plausible, the fable specifically emphasizes the ""pretense"" and the status of the wheel as the ""worst,"" focusing on the act of complaining/creaking rather than just masking a vulnerability.

In many classical collections (such as those by Samuel Croxall or Thomas James), this specific fable (often titled ""The Creaking Wheel"") concludes that those who are the least useful or most problematic are often the most loud in their complaints.

morables_612,"There was a woman of Sybaris who broke a jar. The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, 'I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you'd gone right",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the fable step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A woman breaks a jar.
2.  **The Response of the Jar:** Instead of being repaired or addressing the physical damage, the jar (personified) focuses on the legal/argumentative aspect by bringing a witness to testify about the accident.
3.  **The Woman's Critique:** The woman points out that the jar's priorities are misplaced. Seeking a ""witness"" (legal validation or an argument) does nothing to fix the breakage. A ""bandage"" (an immediate, practical action to repair the damage) would have been the logical and wise response.
4.  **The Synthesis:** The story contrasts the futility of litigation and talk with the necessity of practical action. It suggests that when a problem occurs, it is far better to act to fix it than to spend energy assigning blame or gathering testimony.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Action is more valuable than arguments.** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between the ""bandage"" (action) and the ""witness/court-case"" (argument).
*   **B) You can't please everybody.** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **C) Practicality triumphs over sarcasm.** While the woman is being sarcastic, the lesson is not about sarcasm itself, but about the jar's lack of practical action.
*   **D) Practical fortune...** This is a complex philosophical statement that does not fit the simple logic of the fable.
*   **E) Small actions can reveal hidden strengths.** The story is about fixing a mistake, not hidden strengths.

The most accurate moral is that it is wiser to take practical steps to resolve a problem than to pursue useless talk or legalities.

morables_506,"The dolphins and Whales waged a fierce war with each other. When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict**: Large, powerful creatures (Dolphins and Whales) are engaged in a serious, destructive war.
2.  **The Intervention**: A Sprat (a very small, insignificant fish) offers to mediate the dispute and act as an umpire to bring peace.
3.  **The Reaction**: The Dolphins reject the offer immediately. They state that they would prefer to continue their mutual destruction rather than allow someone as lowly or insignificant as a Sprat to interfere in their business.
4.  **The Lesson**: The core of the story is the pride of the combatants. Even in the face of death or ruin, they find the idea of an ""inferior"" mediator more offensive than the war itself. They consider the ""interference"" of a smaller party to be an insult to their status.

Looking at the options:
*   **A**: ""Some would rather fight than not"" touches on the preference for war, but misses the crucial detail about the ""umpire.""
*   **B**: Adaptability is not the theme here.
*   **C**: This is a common theme in fables, but the specific focus here is on the **refusal of help from those deemed beneath them.**
*   **D**: This emphasizes the pride of the combatants and their refusal to let others interfere, matching the tone of the Dolphin's reply. This fable is often summarized with the moral that ""some men of no account, in a time of public disturbance, think themselves of importance,"" or conversely, that the proud would rather perish than be saved by the lowly.
*   **E**: While true that the conflict leads to ruin, it doesn't capture the specific interaction with the Sprat.

In the context of Aesop's fables, this specific story (The Sprat and the Dolphin) is traditionally used to illustrate that **proud people often value their status or the ""dignity"" of their conflict more than their own safety**, or that they disdain the help of those they consider insignificant. 

Among the provided choices, **C** is the most standard interpretation of the lesson: the combatants' pride prevents a peaceful resolution.

When th",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the interaction between the Man and the Satyr:

1.  **The Observation:** The Man uses the same action (blowing breath) for two opposite purposes: first to warm his hands and then to cool his food.
2.  **The Satyr’s Reaction:** The Satyr views this inconsistency as a sign of duplicity or untrustworthiness. He interprets the ability to produce two opposite effects from the same source as a mark of a double-dealer or a ""two-faced"" individual.
3.  **The Metaphor:** In literature and idioms, ""blowing hot and cold"" refers to a person who is inconsistent, indecisive, or hypocritical—someone who changes their opinion or allegiance depending on the situation.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the Satyr's conclusion. If a person can use the same ""breath"" (logic/words) to support opposite sides, they are perceived as unreliable or treacherous.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there are no wishes in this story.
*   **C:** While the man is being practical/adaptable, the story is a cautionary tale told from the Satyr's perspective, framing this flexibility as a character flaw rather than a virtue.
*   **D:** This is overly complex and does not fit the simple logic of the fable.
*   **E:** This is a general moral, but the specific idiom of ""blowing hot and cold"" points directly to the danger of inconsistency and double-dealing.

Historically, Aesop's fable of ""The Man and the Satyr"" is used to warn against those who are inconsistent or ""double-tongued.""

1.  **The Setting:** Socrates builds a very small house.
2.  **The Question:** A neighbor questions why a man of such stature would have such a ""tiny little house,"" implying that he should have a larger space to accommodate more people or reflect his status.
3.  **The Response:** Socrates replies, ""if only I could fill it with true friends!"" 
4.  **The Implication:** Socrates is suggesting that even a tiny house is difficult to fill because ""true friends"" are so rare. He isn't worried about the physical size of the building; he is commenting on the scarcity of genuine human connection.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) True friends are hard to find:** This directly aligns with Socrates’ witty retort. He implies that the house only feels ""too small"" if you have an abundance of true friends, which is a rare luxury.
*   **B) No curse weighs more heavily than a guilty conscience:** This is a moral from a different type of fable; it has no relevance to the text.
*   **C) Curiosity fuels wisdom:** While Socrates is associated with wisdom, the neighbor's curiosity here is portrayed as slightly judgmental or superficial, not as a source of wisdom.
*   **D) Do not play the modest wise man...:** This is a critique of the narrator or Socrates, not the moral lesson intended by the fable.
*   **E) True greatness often requires enduring present hardships...:** While the narrator mentions being willing to die like Socrates for his fame, this is a reflection by the storyteller, not the moral lesson of the interaction regarding the house.

The fable (originally by Phaedrus, based on a Socratic anecdote) focuses specifically on the rarity of genuine friendship.

Admittedly, Prometheus had made the lion very large and handsome, supplying him with sharp fangs in his jaw and arming him w",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative progression:

1.  **The Lion's Problem:** Despite being the most powerful and majestic of animals, the lion is obsessed with his one perceived weakness: a fear of roosters. He is so ashamed of this ""cowardice"" that he loses his will to live.
2.  **The Turning Point:** The lion meets the elephant, who is even larger and more powerful. He discovers the elephant is terrified of something much smaller and more insignificant than a rooster—a tiny gnat.
3.  **The Realization:** The lion realizes that even the mightiest creatures have vulnerabilities. He concludes that his situation is actually superior to the elephant's, which restores his self-worth and desire to live.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) There is always someone else worse off than you:** This matches the lion's conclusion. By seeing that the ""mightier"" elephant has a ""lesser"" weakness, the lion realizes his situation is not as bad as he thought.
*   **B) No matter how you brag, you can be undone:** The lion is not bragging; he is lamenting.
*   **C) Strength alone does not guarantee invulnerability:** While true in the story, the focus of the ending is on the lion's shift in perspective regarding his own misery.
*   **D) You may share the labours of the powerful...:** This is the moral of a different fable (The Lion's Share) and is unrelated to this text.
*   **E) Even divine gifts can spark envy:** This is not supported by the text; the lion is dissatisfied, not envious of others' gifts.

The lesson is that everyone has their own burdens and weaknesses, and perspective can show us that our own problems are often not as unique or insurmountable as they seem.

The goddess clearly hates you so much that she has taken",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the behavior of the characters:

1.  **The Premise:** The crow is performing a sacrifice to Athena. In Greek mythology, the crow was once Athena's companion but was dismissed and replaced by the owl. Consequently, the crow's omens became associated with bad luck or loss of credibility.
2.  **The Dog's Argument:** The dog points out that it seems foolish to worship or sacrifice to someone (Athena) who has already shown disdain or hostility toward you. 
3.  **The Crow's Reasoning:** The crow explains that she is sacrificing *specifically because* she is in the goddess's bad graces. She believes that by treating an ""enemy"" or a hostile power with honor and generosity, she can persuade that power to change its mind and favor her.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** This matches the crow's logic. She treats a powerful figure who ""hates"" her well in the hope of gaining credibility or favor (changing the goddess's attitude).
*   **B:** There is no lesson about selecting enemies here.
*   **C:** While the crow is hopeful, the fable is more specifically about the transactional nature of seeking favor from those who dislike us.
*   **D:** The crow is acting without ""critical means"" (she has no guarantee of success), so this contradicts the story.
*   **E:** The story isn't about the friendship between the dog and the crow, but about the crow's relationship with Athena.

In collections of Aesop's fables (such as the Perry Index), this story is traditionally used to illustrate that people try to win over their enemies or those who dislike them through gifts or sacrifices in hopes of reconciliation or gain.

1. **Analyze the narrative:** The female hyena is being mistreated by the male. According to the internal logic of the fable (the ""double nature""), these roles are not permanent.
2. **Identify the warning:** The female hyena warns the male that their positions will soon be swapped. Her message is essentially: ""Treat me well now, because soon I will be in the position of power (the male) and you will be the one being mistreated (the female).""
3. **Evaluate the options:**

The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Premise:** The lion (King of the Land) and the dolphin (King of the Sea) form an alliance based on their status and mutual respect. 
2.  **The Conflict:** The lion enters a battle on land (against a bull) and calls upon his ally for help.
3.  **The Limitation:** Despite the dolphin’s willingness and ""regal"" status, he is physically incapable of assisting because his nature restricts him to the water.
4.  **The Resolution/Lesson:** The lion feels betrayed, but the dolphin points out that his nature prevents him from acting. The alliance failed not because of a lack of will, but because the lion chose an ally who—regardless of their power in their own domain—could not practically assist him in his specific time of need.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This directly addresses the practical failure of the alliance. It highlights that when choosing allies, effectiveness in ""moments of peril"" is more important than status.
*   **B)** The dolphin did not have an ""inclination to betray""; he literally could not help.
*   **C)** While true that they faced adversaries, this doesn't capture the lesson about the alliance.
*   **D)** This is a generic motivational statement that ignores the plot's focus on the failed partnership.
*   **E)** This is a modern interpretation, but traditional Aesopic morals focus on the practical utility of choosing friends who are capable of helping.

Option **A** is the classic moral associated with this fable (Aesop's *The Lion and the Dolphin*), emphasizing that we should choose friends based on their ability to stand by us in the specific environments where we face danger.

1.  **The Conflict:** A fox tries to deceive a cicada into coming down from a tree so she can eat it, using flattery as her tool.
2.  **The Counter-move:** The cicada is not fooled. He tests the fox by dropping a leaf, confirming the fox's predatory intent when she pounces on it.
3.  **The Lesson Revealed:** The cicada explains *why* he was prepared and suspicious. He says, ""I've been on my guard against foxes ever since I saw the wings of a cicada in the spoor of a fox.""
4.  **The Core Message:** The cicada avoided a deadly mistake because he observed what had happened to others (the cicada wings in the fox's droppings) and learned from their misfortune.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the cicada's final statement. He became ""wise"" (on his guard) by observing the ""misfortunes of his neighbors"" (the remains of other cicadas).
*   **B)** There is no religious or divine judgment element in this fable.
*   **C)** While trickery is present, the focus is on the cicada's prudence, not the recursive nature of deception.
*   **D)** This describes a self-fulfilling prophecy (like the story of Oedipus), which is the opposite of what happens here; the cicada's caution *saved* him.
*   **E)** While the fox's plan revealed her intent, the primary lesson emphasized by the cicada's parting words is the value of learning from others' fates.

1.  **The Action:** The Wolf attempts to deceive the Kid by mimicking the voice of the mother Goat. This acts as a ""counterfeit"" or hypocritical performance where the Wolf pretends to be someone he is not (a friend/family member) to achieve a malicious end.
2.  **The Conflict:** The Kid identifies the deception. Despite the Wolf's attempt to sound like a Goat, his physical appearance and true nature remain visible (""he appeared too much like a Wolf to be trusted"").
3.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that no matter how well a person (or wolf) tries to disguise their true nature through speech or pretense, their true identity and motives will eventually be revealed.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) A hypocrite can usually be found out:** This directly matches the narrative. The Wolf is a hypocrite (pretending to be kind/the mother), but the Kid sees through the disguise. 
*   **B) & D):** These themes (demise, cowardice) do not appear in the text.
*   **C) Caring hearts can see through counterfeit desires:** While the Kid sees through the ""counterfeit,"" the story is more about caution and the failure of a disguise than ""caring hearts.""
*   **E) Neglecting careful oversight...:** This is the opposite of what happened; the Kid followed instructions and exercised careful oversight.

Apollo immediately explained to the snake, 'If you had simply killed the first person who ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation**: A snake is being stepped on repeatedly by many people. This implies the snake is being treated as a doormat or a victim because it has shown no resistance.
2.  **The Setting**: The snake seeks counsel or refuge at the temple of Apollo (the god of prophecy and wisdom).
3.  **Apollo’s Advice**: Apollo points out that the snake's current plight is a result of its failure to react to the very first transgression. By not striking back at the first person, the snake signaled to everyone else that it was safe to step on.
4.  **The Lesson**: The story emphasizes that an immediate, punitive response to a ""crime"" (the first person stepping on the snake) serves as a deterrent to others. If the first offender is punished, others will fear the consequences and refrain from the same behavior.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses the idea that punishing an initial crime swiftly serves as a deterrent to others.
*   **B** talks about delayed punishment for wicked people, which contradicts Apollo’s advice for immediacy.
*   **C** suggests immediate action is bad, which is the opposite of Apollo’s point.
*   **D** focuses on cleverness over force; however, the story is specifically about the deterrent power of retaliation.
*   **E** focuses on the sanctuary, which is just a plot device to get the snake to Apollo.

The moral is that an initial display of strength or punishment prevents future victimization by instilling fear in others.

morables_230,"A lion was standing over a young bull whom he had killed when a robber showed up and demanded a part of the spoils. 'I would agree,' the lion said, 'if you were not already in the habit of taking what",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions between the lion and the two characters:

1.  **The Interaction with the Robber:** The robber approaches the lion with a demand rooted in his character as a thief. The lion refuses him specifically because the robber is used to taking what he wants by force or entitlement. The lion resists the ""villain.""
2.  **The Interaction with the Wayfarer:** The traveller is innocent and modest. Rather than demanding a share, he recognizes the lion's power and retreats. The lion, moved by this display of respect and lack of greed, rewards the man's modesty by sharing the prize and creating a safe space for him to take it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between the two men. The robber (taking by force) is resisted, while the traveller (humility) receives generosity.
*   **B:** While the robber is untrustworthy, the story's focus is more on the lion's response to different behaviors rather than a betrayal.
*   **C:** The traveler's fear didn't ""tame"" the lion; rather, his character earned the lion's respect.
*   **D:** The villain (robber) was not cunning; he was demanding and failed.
*   **E:** While the robber acted entitled, the primary lesson highlights the contrast between his failure and the humble man's success.

The story teaches that bold entitlement and habituated theft result in rejection, whereas modesty and respect for others' power often yield rewards. This corresponds best with option A.

Since he was constantly paying out money and spending great sums on the offerings, the god came to him one night and said: 'L",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Action:** A man is voluntarily spending all of his money on expensive religious offerings at a hero shrine.
2.  **The Intervention:** The god appears at night to tell the man to stop.
3.  **The Reason:** The god points out that the man's own actions (squandering wealth) will lead to poverty. Crucially, the god warns that when the man becomes poor, he will likely shift the responsibility for his misfortune onto the god (""you'll put the blame on me!"") rather than his own financial recklessness.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the god's warning. The man is being ""foolish"" by spending beyond his means, and the god anticipates that the man will blame divine power for his eventual ""misfortune"" (poverty).
*   **B)** This focuses on promises, which are not mentioned in the text.
*   **C)** While extravagance is present, the core of the story is about the shifting of blame for self-inflicted consequences.
*   **D)** The man doesn't seem to be seeking profit; he seems to be motivated by excessive devotion/piety.
*   **E)** While a reasonable life lesson, the text specifically emphasizes the avoidance of future blame for poverty, not the definition of true devotion.

The story serves as a warning about human nature: people often cause their own problems through poor choices but find it easier to blame external forces or the divine for the outcome.

When he saw the reflection of his body in the water, he disparaged the slenderness of his legs but revelled in the shape and",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict of Value:** The stag evaluates his own body parts. He views his thin legs as a weakness (disparaging them) and his large antlers as his greatest asset (reveling in them).
2.  **The Test:** When danger arrives (the hunters), the body parts are put to a practical test. The legs, which he hated, perform the vital task of outrunning the hunters. The antlers, which he admired, physically snag on branches and lead to his capture.
3.  **The Realization:** In his final moments, the stag explicitly states the lesson: ""The thing that I disparaged could have saved me while I have been destroyed by the very thing I boasted about.""
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A** captures the essence that utility and value are often found in the things we dismiss or underestimate.
    *   **B** focuses on greed, which is not the central theme here (the stag isn't seeking more; he is admiring what he has).
    *   **C** mentions persistence, which isn't a primary theme.
    *   **D** discusses ""deceivers,"" but there is no deception, only a mistake in judgment.
    *   **E** is close, but the fable's traditional focus is specifically on the irony that ""useful"" things are underrated compared to ""beautiful"" things.

Option A most accurately reflects the ironic reversal in the story: that which is truly useful (the legs) was underrated, while that which was prized for its appearance (the horns) proved a liability.

But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and character dynamics:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Eagle, a powerful predator, ignores the plea of the Beetle (a small, seemingly insignificant insect) and disrespects her while prey-hunting.
2.  **The Retaliation:** Despite being much smaller and weaker, the Beetle uses her unique abilities (flight and persistence) to destroy the Eagle's eggs repeatedly, even when the Eagle seeks protection from the highest authority (Jupiter).
3.  **The Resolution:** Jupiter recognizes that the Beetle had a ""just cause"" for her revenge. The story concludes with a change in the natural order to accommodate the Beetle's grievance.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) The weak may find a way to avenge a wrong:** This directly matches the narrative. The Beetle is physically ""weak"" compared to the Eagle but successfully enacts a long-term plan for vengeance due to the Eagle's initial disrespect and cruelty.
*   **B) Greed for honor:** There is no theme of greed for honor or status leading to death in this story.
*   **C) Power lies in restraint:** While the Eagle lacked restraint, the core of the story focuses on the consequences of underestimating a smaller opponent rather than the general philosophy of restraint.
*   **D) Beauty and leadership:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) Compassion bridging divides:** The story is about revenge and justice, not reconciliation or compassion between the predator and prey (the Hare dies regardless).

The fable (traditionally attributed to Aesop) is intended to warn the powerful against insulting or harming those who seem beneath them, as even the small can find ways to retaliate.

At a certain m",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Accident:** The donkey accidentally falls into the stream, and the salt dissolves. The merchant loses profit, but the donkey learns a trick to make his work easier.
2.  **The Deception:** On the next trip, the donkey intentionally falls into the water to replicate the result. He successfully fools the merchant and lightens his load again.
3.  **The Detection:** The merchant realizes the donkey is intentionally sabotaging the cargo.
4.  **The Consequence:** The merchant uses the donkey's own trick against him by changing the cargo to sponges. When the donkey tries to play the same trick, the result is the opposite: the cargo becomes significantly heavier.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) You can fool someone only so many times:** This fits perfectly. The donkey successfully deceived the merchant once, but the merchant caught on and punished the trickery.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you...:** This is not relevant to the plot of the story.
*   **C) Cunning minds see wicked traps:** While the merchant used a trap, the story is more about the failure of the donkey's deceit rather than the nature of traps themselves.
*   **D) Everyone should be satisfied...:** This represents a pessimistic worldview that doesn't quite match the specific ""action-consequence"" of this fable.
*   **E) Sometimes, accidents can lighten the load...:** This describes the initial event but ignores the punishment and the lesson regarding the donkey's behavior.

The core lesson of Aesop’s Fables often focuses on the consequences of trickery and greed. The donkey’s attempt to repeatedly use a deceptive shortcut led to his downfall because the merchant was observant.

Even after stroking the animal he was not sure of its i,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of this fable (often attributed to Aesop), let’s break down the narrative:

1.  **The Premise:** A blind man prides himself on identifying animals through touch—a method that relies on perceiving the inherent characteristics of a creature.
2.  **The Conflict:** He is presented with a wolf cub. While he cannot definitively name the species (is it a fox or a wolf?), he immediately senses an innate quality or ""vibe"" of the animal.
3.  **The Resolution:** He concludes that regardless of its exact name, the animal possesses a nature that is inherently dangerous to sheep. 
4.  **The Lesson:** The story suggests that even in a young, undeveloped state (""a cub""), the fundamental nature or ""evil tendencies"" of a creature are detectable. The blind man recognizes the potential for harm before the animal has even grown or committed a crime.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) Evil tendencies are shown in early life:** This directly mirrors the blind man sensing the danger in a cub before it has matured.
*   **B) Harsh means/reason:** This is unrelated to the text.
*   **C) Appearances can be misleading:** While the man is blind, the story is actually about his ability to perceive the truth *despite* lack of sight, focused on the animal's nature rather than a visual trick.
*   **D) Reward/Punish:** Not relevant to the plot.
*   **E) Familiar may conceal truth:** The wolf cub is not ""familiar"" to the man in a way that conceals its nature; rather, its nature is revealed despite its youth.

In traditional collections of Aesop's fables, this story is used to illustrate that a ""bad"" nature is visible from the very beginning.

This man noticed that all sorts of people came to him, and he became curious to see who were true friend",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"The story describes a wealthy man who provides for many, but discovers that the vast majority of his guests are only there for the food and comfort, not for him. When he presents a scenario involving risk and sacrifice (a quarrel requiring swords), the ""hangers-on"" disappear, leaving only two individuals.

**Analysis:**
- **Choice A** is a general observation, but the story focuses more on the *discovery* of character during hardship.
- **Choice B** is irrelevant to the narrative.
- **Choice C** is a practical lesson on wealth management rather than the central moral regarding friendship.
- **Choice D** accurately describes the ""hangers-on"": people who are present when it is profitable (a grand table) but make excuses when it is costly (a quarrel).
- **Choice E** is a strong contender, but the narrative pivot is specifically about the test of loyalty and how most people fail it when personal risk is involved.

In traditional collections of fables (like those of Aesop or La Fontaine), this story serves to illustrate that prosperity gains friends, but adversity tries them. Choice **A** captures the essence of the result: despite the man's immense generosity and large social circle, genuine loyalty was found in only a tiny fraction of people.

The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, 'Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch m",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the fable ""The Two Pots,"" let's analyze the core components of the story:

1.  **The Characters:** One pot is made of brass (strong, durable, potentially dangerous to others) and the other is made of earthenware (fragile, easily broken).
2.  **The Conflict:** They are both being carried by the same river (life/fate). The earthenware pot recognizes that even a slight ""touch"" or interaction with the stronger pot will result in its destruction.
3.  **The Lesson:** The fragility of one vessel makes an association with a much stronger vessel inherently dangerous, regardless of intentions. The earthenware pot understands that it cannot survive in close proximity to something so much more powerful or ""harder"" than itself.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) Equals make the best friends:** This is the traditional moral attributed to Aesop's version of this fable. It suggests that if the pots were made of the same material (equals), they could travel together safely. Association between the weak and the strong often leads to the destruction of the weak.
*   **B) Overestimating worth:** The pot is not overestimating its worth; it is accurately assessing its fragility.
*   **C, E) The worth of different roles/vessels:** While poetic, these are modern interpretations of ""value"" that do not address the practical danger presented in the fable (being broken).
*   **D) Cautious abstain:** While applicable, it is too vague compared to the specific lesson about ""equals.""

In literature and classic collections of Aesop's Fables (such as Townsend's or Vernon Jones'), the moral is explicitly stated as: **""Equals make the best friends""** or **""The strong and the weak cannot keep company.""**

The wild boar replied, 'I have",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,1,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the fable step by step:

1.  **Observation of behavior:** The wild boar is performing a defensive task (sharpening his tusks) during a period of calm (there is ""no immediate need"").
2.  **The Question:** The fox questions the utility of the action, suggesting that it's unnecessary since there is no current danger.
3.  **The Rationale:** The boar explains that he is preparing in advance. If he waits until danger is actually present, it will be too late to prepare; he needs his weapons ready the moment the threat arrives.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core message is about the importance of preparation during times of peace or safety so that one is ready for future adversity.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace.** This aligns perfectly with the boar's logic. By being ready for a fight, one is protected and potentially deters threats.
*   **B) God is the ultimate judge.** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **C) Curiosity must be guided by prudence.** This focuses on the fox, but the fable's wisdom comes from the boar's response.
*   **D) Prudent men feel worst when they contribute to their own inquisitive undoing.** This does not fit the narrative, as no one suffers an ""undoing.""
*   **E) Even nature prepares its own defenses.** While true, this is a literal observation rather than the intended moral lesson for the reader.

The story is a classic Aesop's fable often titled ""The Wild Boar and the Fox,"" which is traditionally used to teach that one should prepare for danger in times of safety.

When the depositor then summoned him to swear an oath regarding the deposit, he realized the danger he was in and prepar",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the dialogue:

1.  **The Plot:** A man plans to embezzle a friend's deposit. He encounters the god ""Oath,"" who personifies the consequences of perjury.
2.  **The Deception:** The man believes he has a ""window of safety"" because the god claims to visit cities only every thirty or forty years. Based on this perceived predictability, the man commits his crime (the false oath) the very next day.
3.  **The Twist:** The god returns immediately to punish the man.
4.  **The Lesson:** The god clarifies that while his average schedule might be long, he can return instantly if provoked.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A:** This matches the dialogue perfectly. The man thought punishment followed a fixed, long-term schedule, but the god proved that timing is unpredictable and can be immediate for those who test fate.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; the story is about a single man's interaction with a god.
*   **C:** While the man's fear led him to question the god, the ""distortion"" was actually caused by the man's greed and his attempt to ""game the system.""
*   **D:** The story focuses on deception and punishment, but does not compare ""inciters"" to ""participants.""
*   **E:** While the man took what wasn't his, the story's climax isn't about internal conscience/guilt, but rather the external, immediate punishment by the divine.

The core of the fable is that one should not assume there is a delay in justice or a ""safe"" time to be wicked. Punishment for evil deeds can arrive at any moment.

1.  **The First Warning:** The farmer initially asks his neighbors for help. The mother Lark is unconcerned because she knows that when a person relies on the favors of others, the task is rarely urgent or guaranteed to happen.
2.  **The Second Warning:** The farmer decides to take action himself, hiring laborers and committing to do the work personally. The mother Lark recognizes this as the moment of true urgency.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that a task is only certain to be completed when the person responsible for it takes the initiative to do it themselves rather than waiting for others.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) Self-help is the best help:** This aligns perfectly with the theme that personal initiative and self-reliance are the only ways to ensure a job gets done.
*   **B) Cunning often outwits itself:** There is no ""cunning"" or trickery involved in this story.
*   **C) Wisdom grows with determination:** While the farmer is determined, the core lesson is about *who* is doing the work.
*   **D) Do unto others...:** This is the Golden Rule, which is not the focus here.
*   **E) Even the tiniest cradle...:** This is a poetic sentiment about the nest but doesn't reflect the practical lesson of the farmer's actions.

1.  **The Conflict:** A man mocks Aesop for acting ""childish"" or ""crazy"" because he is playing marbles. The man believes that a person of intellect or status should always be serious and focused.
2.  **The Metaphor:** Aesop uses an unstrung bow. A bow that is constantly under tension (strung) loses its elasticity and strength, eventually snapping. To remain a functional tool, it must be unstrung (relaxed) when not in use.
3.  **The Application:** Aesop represents the bow. By playing games (relaxing his mind), he is ""unstringing"" himself so that he remains sharp and effective when he needs to return to serious work or storytelling. 
4.  **The Lesson:** Periodic relaxation and play are not signs of madness or laziness; they are necessary to prevent burnout and maintain mental vigor.

*   **Option A** directly addresses the core of the metaphor: the necessity of rest (unstringing the bow) to maintain the effectiveness of the tool/mind.
*   Option B is unrelated to the plot.
*   Option C describes the observer's reaction but isn't the lesson Aesop conveys.
*   Option D is a description of what Aesop did, but not the universal truth the story aims to teach.
*   Option E is close, but Aesop's specific explanation focuses on the *utility of rest* rather than just the *appearance of wisdom*.

Therefore, the primary lesson is that the mind, like a bow, must be allowed to rest to stay functional.

'I breed only one,' said the lioness, 'but he is very ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the sow and the lioness:

1.  **The Characters:** The sow is characterized by her large litter (quantity), while the lioness has only one cub (low quantity).
2.  **The Interaction:** The sow ""loudly accosted"" the lioness, essentially boasting about the number of offspring she produced.
3.  **The Resolution:** The lioness dismisses the sow's numerical advantage by pointing out that her single offspring is a lion—a creature of significantly higher status, strength, and ""quality"" than a pig.

**Analysis of the Lessons:**
*   **A) Quality is more valuable than quantity:** This fits the narrative perfectly. While the sow can produce many piglets, one lion is worth more than a dozen pigs. The lioness values the excellence of her single child over the sheer volume of the sow's litter.
*   **B) Gossips are to be seen and not heard:** This does not apply, as the interaction is about reproduction/worth, not gossip.
*   **C) Confidence without humility leads astray:** While the sow is overconfident, the core of the retort is about the status of the offspring.
*   **D) Setting aside disputes:** The story does not involve a compromise or a life-threatening conflict that needs de-escalation; it is a witty exchange about value.
*   **E) Nurturing is key:** While both are mothers, the emphasis is on the result/nature of the child, not the process of nurturing.

The fable (often attributed to Aesop as ""The Sow and the Lioness"") is a classic illustration that one high-quality thing is better than many low-quality things.

1.  **The Appearance of ""Opportunity""**: The figure is described as running swiftly and balancing on a razor's edge, highlighting that opportunities are fleeting and precarious.
2.  **The Lock of Hair vs. The Bald Head**: He has a ""lock of hair on his forehead"" but is otherwise bald. This is a classic allegorical representation (often associated with the Greek god Kairos). If you are facing the opportunity (from the front), you have something to grab onto (the hair).
3.  **The Moment of Passing**: The story notes that ""once he has moved on not even Jupiter himself can pull him back."" This emphasizes that once a window of time passes, the opportunity is gone forever and cannot be retrieved even by the most powerful gods.
4.  **The Conclusion**: The text explicitly states this is a ""symbol of Opportunity, the brief moment in which things are possible.""

Based on these points, the lesson is that because opportunities are fast-moving and impossible to catch once they have passed you by, you must act immediately while they are right in front of you. 

*   **A) Seize opportunities when they arise** directly matches this lesson.
*   B) is incorrect as it deals with contentment, not action.
*   C) concerns power, while the story focus is on timing.
*   D) concerns boasting, which is not mentioned.
*   E) focuses on the ""razor's edge"" (danger/vulnerability) but misses the core message about the transience of time and the need to ""grasp"" the moment.

morables_597,"A fox was standing not far from a trap, pondering every possible approach. A nearby wolf noticed the fox and approached her. He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The fox recognizes a danger (the trap) and chooses not to engage with it herself. When the wolf appears, she uses ""flattery"" and false kindness, calling the wolf a ""dearest friend"" to entice him into a dangerous situation for her own observation or benefit.
2.  **The Wolf's Action:** The wolf trusts the fox’s words without verifying the safety of the situation. He ignores the suspicious nature of a ""free gift"" from a known trickster.
3.  **The Result:** The wolf is injured by the trap, realizing that the fox's ""friendship"" was a deceptive ploy.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Flatterers and deceivers are not to be trusted:** This fits perfectly. The fox used the guise of friendship and generosity to lead the wolf into a trap.
*   **B) Know yourself and your limits:** While applicable to many fables, this doesn't address the core interaction of deception here.
*   **C) Trust can be a double-edged sword:** While true, the story specifically highlights the *malice* of the deceiver rather than the philosophical nature of trust.
*   **D) A single reliable skill is worth more than a bag of tricks:** This is the moral of ""The Fox and the Cat,"" which deals with escaping a predator, not deception between peers.
*   **E) Caution is wise, but collaboration can reveal new paths:** The fox was not collaborating; she was exploiting.

The core lesson is that when someone known for being clever or cunning offers a ""gift"" or uses excessive flattery, their motives should be questioned.

Winter was approaching, so one of the dung beetles said to the other, 'I want to g",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character motivations:

1.  **The Promise:** One dung beetle promises to bring food back to his friend if he finds a good source on the mainland. This promise is made under the premise of mutual benefit or friendship.
2.  **The Outcome:** The beetle finds an abundance of food, becomes ""plump and fat,"" and enjoys the resources for himself throughout the winter.
3.  **The Excuse:** Upon returning empty-handed, the beetle blames the ""nature of the place"" for his failure to fulfill his promise, claiming the food could not be transported.
4.  **The Core Lesson:** The story highlights a situation where someone makes a generous offer when they are in need of a plan or a departure, but when they actually find success and luxury, they fail to act on that generosity. The ""nature"" of the food being ""moist and fresh"" (which makes it heavy or difficult to carry) is used as a convenient excuse for selfishness.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Beware of empty promises made during good times:** This fits the theme of a promise that was easily made but not kept once the promiser was satisfied and comfortable.
*   **B) Picking fights:** Not relevant to the plot.
*   **C) Curiosity:** The beetle wasn't acting out of curiosity, but survival and self-interest.
*   **D) Work and play:** The story is about resources and reliability, not scheduling.
*   **E) Value in discarded items:** While dung beetles do find value in what is discarded, this is the setting of the story rather than its moral lesson.

The beetle's failure to provide for his friend after benefitting from his own journey demonstrates the hollowness of his initial promise.

When they came to a well, one of them thought that they should jump in immediately, but the other one said, ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this story, let's look at the behavior of the two frogs:

1.  **The Situation:** The frogs are looking for a new home because their old one dried up. They find a well, which appears to solve their immediate problem (it has water).
2.  **The Reaction:** The first frog is impulsive and wants to jump in immediately without considering the consequences.
3.  **The Wisdom:** The second person stops to consider the future. They realize that if the well dries up just like their pond did, they would be trapped at the bottom because a well is much deeper and more difficult to escape than a pond.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story emphasizes the importance of thinking about potential consequences and future obstacles before committing to an action.

**Evaluation of the options:**
*   **A) Look before you leap:** This matches the story perfectly. The second frog is literally advising the first frog to look (evaluate the situation) before they leap (jump into the well).
*   **B) Watch the actions of your enemy:** There are no enemies in this story.
*   **C) Haste often leads to regret:** While related, this focuses on the *result* of acting quickly. ""Look before you leap"" is the specific proactive advice given by the second frog.
*   **D) Impulsive, vicious people...:** This is the moral of a different fable (The Scorpion and the Frog). There is no malice in this story.
*   **E) Adaptability is key...:** While the frogs are trying to adapt, the story's climax is specifically about the decision-making process regarding the well.

The most accurate and traditional moral for this specific Aesop's fable is ""Look before you leap.""

He saluted the gods who came to congratulate him one after another, but when he was approached by Plutus, the god of wealth and th",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative and the dialogue:

1.  **Context**: Hercules is admitted to heaven because of his ""excellent qualities"" (virtue/heroism).
2.  **The Conflict**: While he greets all other gods, he pointedly ignores Plutus, the god of wealth.
3.  **The Reasoning**: When questioned by Jupiter, Hercules explains his disdain: he hates Plutus because wealth favors ""the wicked"" and ""corrupts the entire world."" 
4.  **Implicit Meaning**: Hercules represents virtue and merit. Plutus represents money, which Hercules argues is often used to undermine goodness or reward those who do not deserve it.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Coffers of cash put a stop to honest traffic in praise**: This is a direct interpretation of the text. In several classical translations of Aesop's Fables (specifically Phaedrus), this specific fable concludes with the moral that wealth corrupts the integrity of recognition and praise because it favors those who haven't earned it through merit.
*   **B) Easy life... conceal a threat**: This deals with envy/danger, which isn't the focus here.
*   **C) Wealth cannot buy true excellence**: While thematically related, Hercules has already achieved excellence; his point is specifically about how wealth corrupts society and aids the wicked.
*   **D) Corrupting thieves...**: Not relevant to the plot.
*   **E) Virtue paves the path to the highest rewards**: While Hercules got to heaven via virtue, the climax of the story is his rejection of wealth, making ""A"" a more specific match for the dialogue provided.

In the context of traditional Aesop translations (especially those by Phaedrus), the moral focuses on how wealth corrupts the ""traffic in praise"" (merit-based recognition). Hercules, the symbol of earned merit, refuses to acknowledge wealth because wealth grants status to the wicked, thereby ruining the honest distribution of honor.

morables_301,"A dog made false accusations against the sheep, demanding that she pay him back a loaf of bread which, he insisted, the sheep had supposedly borrowed from him. The dog summoned the wolf as his witness",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** A dog makes a false accusation against an innocent sheep to extort something she does not owe.
2.  **The Deception:** The wolf provides false testimony (perjury) to help the dog win the case, resulting in an unjust outcome for the sheep.
3.  **The Resolution:** Shortly after the injustice, the wolf (the liar) meets a grizzly end in a ditch.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The sheep observes the dead wolf and explicitly identifies the lesson: that his death is the ""reward"" (punishment) given to liars.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Directly aligns with the sheep's concluding statement that the gods punish liars. The wolf’s death is portrayed as divine justice or a ""just consequence.""
*   **B:** Focuses on using harsh means for education/reasoning, which isn't the theme here.
*   **C:** While the story involves deception masking innocence, it focuses more on the *aftermath* or retribution for that deception.
*   **D:** Suggests that passivity invites more insults; however, the sheep didn't ""put up"" with it by choice—she was legally sentenced.
*   **E:** While true in a general sense, the story specifically highlights the ultimate fate of the liar rather than the sociological impact on trust.

The story belongs to the tradition of Aesop's Fables (specifically ""The Wolf and the Sheep"" or ""The Dog and the Sheep""), where the central theme is that those who profit from lies will eventually face a ruinous end.

'What have I done that I must die?' said she; 'I have stolen neither gold nor silver, but only a grain of corn to satisfy my ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context**: A Lark (a small, relatively harmless bird) is caught in a trap by a Fowler (a bird catcher). The Fowler represents the adversary—the person who has power over the Lark's life.
2.  **The Argument**: The Lark defends herself based on a ""proportionality"" of crime. She argues that her ""sin"" (stealing a single grain of corn) is insignificant compared to the penalty (death). She appeals to justice and logic.
3.  **The Outcome**: The Fowler ignores the logic entirely. He does not engage in a debate because he is not an impartial judge; he is the person who benefits from her capture. He acts according to his own interests (getting food/the catch) regardless of the Lark's innocence or the smallness of her offense.
4.  **The Lesson**: The story illustrates that when the person you are arguing against is the same person who has the power to punish you and a motive to do so, logic and pleas for justice are usually futile. There is no ""fair trial"" when the prosecutor and the judge are the same person.

Evaluating the options:
*   **B** focuses on the Lark's risk, but the story's climax is about the futility of her plea.
*   **C** is contradicted by the text (silence was met with violence).
*   **D** is convoluted and doesn't fit the Fowler's actions.
*   **E** is incorrect as sincerity failed to save the Lark.
*   **A** accurately reflects the power dynamic: logic is useless against a biased authority who has already decided your fate.

Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the themes:

1.  **The Premise:** A nurse makes a threat (a promise to the wolf) that she doesn't actually intend to keep. She says she will throw the child to the wolf if it cries.
2.  **The Wolf's Mistake:** The wolf hears the nurse's words and takes them literally as a factual ""promise."" He waits patiently for the reward he believes he was promised.
3.  **The Outcome:** When the child cries, the nurse does the opposite of what she said; she protects the child and sics the dogs on the wolf.
4.  **The Lesson:** The wolf learned (too late) that he should not have believed the words of a person who is naturally his enemy (the nurse/human). Humans and wolves are traditional enemies in fables, and the ""promises"" or threats made by one toward the other are not based on integrity or truth.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Enemies' promises were made to be broken.** This matches the situation perfectly. The wolf expected an ""enemy"" (the nurse) to follow through on a statement that benefited him, but she had no intention of doing so. This is the classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable (traditionally titled ""The Wolf and the Nurse"").
*   **B)** There is no theme of blaming others here.
*   **C)** The plan didn't silence fear; it invited danger to the door.
*   **D)** The wolf wasn't ""serving"" the nurse; he was acting in self-interest.
*   **E)** While true in a literal sense, it is not a traditional moral of this fable, which focuses more on the wolf's foolishness in believing an enemy.

The wolf learned that you cannot trust the word of an enemy.

Then the fly laughed at the man and said, 'You wanted to avenge the sting of a ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the actions:

1.  **The Action:** The man accidentally harms himself (a slap) while trying to eliminate a minor nuisance (a fly).
2.  **The Conflict:** The fly mocks the man, suggesting that by hurting himself, he has ""added insult to injury"" and that his desire for ""murder"" (killing the fly) backfired.
3.  **The Man's Defense:** The man explicitly distinguishes between his **intent** and the **outcome**. He forgives himself because he ""did not try to hurt [himself] on purpose."" Conversely, he views the fly's malicious intent (drinking blood) as justification for any risk or inconvenience he takes to destroy it.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core of the man's rebuttal—and the turning point of the fable—is that an accidental injury to oneself is negligible compared to the justice of removing a malicious actor. He prioritizes the *reason* behind the action over the physical result.

While ""in anger, we cause ourselves more harm"" (Option E) is a common theme in fables involving flies, it is specifically refuted by the protagonist in this version. The man argues that his self-inflicted slap is irrelevant because it lacked intent, whereas the fly deserves destruction regardless of the cost. This places the philosophical weight on the **intent** of the actors.

- **A) Intent matters more than the outcome:** This aligns with the man's argument that he can forgive himself because he didn't mean to hit himself, whereas the fly's inherent nature justifies the struggle.
- **B, C, D:** These do not accurately reflect the specific exchange between the characters.
- **E):** This is a literal observation of the slap, but the man's speech specifically argues *against* this being the main point.

The fable teaches that we should judge actions based on their purpose or intent rather than just the clumsy result.

The Hunter agreed, but said: 'If you desire to conquer the Stag, you mus",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the outcome:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Horse seeks revenge against the Stag.
2.  **The Compromise:** To gain power over his enemy, the Horse voluntarily surrenders his autonomy to a Hunter, allowing himself to be bridled and saddled.
3.  **The Result:** The Horse accomplishes his goal (defeating the Stag), but discovers that the tools of his victory (the bit and saddle) are now tools of his own enslavement. He traded his freedom for a temporary victory.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core of the fable is the danger of putting oneself in another's power or debt to settle a score. While the quest for revenge/help seemed beneficial at first, the cost—the loss of liberty—was permanent and far greater than the original injury.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Close, but it focuses on the Hunter's intent rather than the Horse's mistake of losing liberty.
*   **B:** This is the most accurate classical moral. It highlights that suffering a slight ""with impunity"" (without striking back) is preferable to the catastrophic loss of freedom involved in putting oneself in another's power.
*   **C:** The story is about power and loss of freedom, not necessarily cunning vs. dominance.
*   **D:** While it touches on the fleeting nature of vengeful satisfaction, it doesn't address the specific outcome of servitude.
*   **E:** This is a strong modern interpretation, but ""B"" captures the specific dynamic of the Horse's choice (surrendering power to gain revenge).

In traditional collections of Aesop's Fables (such as the Townsend version), the lesson is that ""If you allow men to use you for your own purposes, they will use you for theirs,"" but the most precise philosophical moral concerning the trade-off of liberty for revenge is best expressed by option B.

You have such ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Cat's Intent:** The cat wants the eel but doesn't want to get wet. He first tries flattery (praising the stork's beauty) to trick the stork into opening her mouth. When that fails, he turns to insults (calling her ""filthy"") to provoke a reaction.
2.  **The Stork's Reaction:** The stork recognizes that if she responds to the flattery or the insults, she will drop her meal. She remains silent and continues walking, successfully keeping her prize.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the importance of the stork's steadfastness. By not allowing herself to be distracted or provoked by the cat's manipulative words, she achieves her goal (keeping the eel). While flattery and deception are present (options D and E), the core of the stork's success lies in her ability to ignore these distractions and stay the course.

- **Option A** (""Stay focused on your goals"") directly addresses the stork's behavior: she ignored both the ""carrot"" (flattery) and the ""stick"" (insults) to keep her eel.
- **Option B** is irrelevant to the text.
- **Option C** and **E** focus on the cat, but the stork's successful resistance is the central resolution of the fable.
- **Option D** is a potential secondary lesson, but the primary takeaway is the importance of the stork's discipline in the face of provocation.

In many classic interpretations of this fable, the stork's refusal to be baited by the cat's verbal gymnastics serves as a lesson in maintaining focus despite external pressures.

'At the moment I am thi",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Opportunity:** The wolf had a sure meal when the dog was vulnerable on the ground.
2.  **The Persuasion:** The dog offered a promise of a ""better"" meal in the future to escape immediate danger.
3.  **The Mistake:** The wolf abandoned a certain gain (the scrawny dog) for an uncertain, future gain (the fattened dog).
4.  **The Result:** The dog moved to a safe place (the roof) where the wolf could no longer reach him, and the wolf ended up with nothing.

**Analysis of choices:**
*   **A) Take what you can get when you can get it:** This aligns perfectly with the wolf's mistake. He had the dog but let him go based on a promise. The story illustrates that one should secure an immediate advantage rather than risking it for a potential future benefit.
*   **B) There is nothing more valuable than liberty:** While the dog gained his freedom, the story focuses more on the interaction and the wolf's loss.
*   **C) The cunning prey on the gullible:** While true, this is a broad observation. The specific context involves passing up an immediate opportunity.
*   **D) Cunning enemies' persuasive promises...:** This is a variation of the moral often applied to ""The Wolf and the Crane,"" but here the dog is the one making the promise to survive, and the focus is on the wolf's failure to act when he had the chance.
*   **E) A plea for mercy can sometimes delay the inevitable:** The dog's escape was permanent, not a delay of the inevitable.

This fable (often attributed to Aesop) is a classic illustration of the proverb: ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."" The lesson is that you should not sacrifice a certain benefit for an uncertain promise.

When he finally decided to disembark, he said, 'I will let myself down now as fast as I can so as not to burden",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interaction between the gnat and the camel:

1.  **The Gnat's Perspective:** The gnat believes his presence is a significant burden to the camel. He frames his departure as a generous act of relief for the animal, assuming his weight is something the camel must actively endure.
2.  **The Camel's Reality:** The camel is completely unaffected. He was unaware the gnat had even arrived and informs the gnat that his departure makes no difference to the ""load."" 
3.  **The Core Lesson:** The story highlights a mismatch between self-importance and actual impact. The gnat views himself as highly consequential, while to the camel (his ""neighbor"" in this context), he is entirely insignificant. 

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the theme of puffed-up self-importance versus how others actually perceive us.
*   **B:** While the gnat is arrogant, ""influence"" isn't the primary focus so much as the gnat's inflated sense of his own magnitude.
*   **C & D:** These focus on patience, but the camel isn't being ""patient"" with a burden—he is simply indifferent because the ""burden"" doesn't exist to him.
*   **E:** While true, this is a literal observation of the plot rather than a ""moral"" or lesson regarding human behavior/character.

The fox turned to the women and said, 'What shouts there would be aga",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the conflict and the dialogue:

1.  **The Context:** A fox observes humans eating roasted chickens. In the fox's world, eating a chicken results in being hunted, shouted at, and chased by dogs.
2.  **The Fox's Grievance:** The fox points out what he perceives as a double standard. He suggests that if he were doing exactly what the women are doing (eating chickens), he would be treated as a criminal.
3.  **The Old Woman's Rebuttal:** The old woman identifies the crucial difference: **ownership**. The women are eating chickens that ""are ours"" (property they own/earned), whereas the fox ""takes pleasure in things that belong to others"" (theft).
4.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches that the morality of an action often depends on the right to the property involved. Just because an owner is permitted to use or consume their own property does not mean a stranger or an outsider has the same right to that property.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This directly addresses the old woman's point. It highlights that we cannot assume we have the right to treat others' property the way they treat it themselves.
*   **B:** There is no mention of friendship or betrayal in the story.
*   **C, D, E:** These focus on the ""silence"" mentioned in the text, but the silence is a secondary detail used to contrast with the ""shouts"" the fox would receive. The core of the argument is about property rights (theft vs. ownership).

1.  **The Action:** A viper (a creature with venomous teeth used to harm others) attempts to bite a file (a tool made of hardened iron used to wear down other metals).
2.  **The Outcome:** The viper's attack is futile because the file is harder and more durable than anything the viper can offer.
3.  **The File's Rebuttal:** The file points out the absurdity of the viper's attempt, noting that its entire nature is to ""gnaw through every sort of iron.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates the folly of trying to harm someone or something that is impervious to your attacks, or someone who is much stronger/tougher than you are. In many classical interpretations (such as those by Aesop), this fable specifically warns against attacking those who are ""insensible"" (impervious, unyielding, or harder than the attacker).

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) It is useless attacking the insensible:** This aligns with the classic moral. ""Insensible"" here refers to the file being unaffected by the viper's bite.
*   **B) Mere words are no help:** The story is not about asking for help; it's about an unprovoked attack.
*   **C) Curiosity without wisdom invites folly:** While the viper was ""testing"" the file, the core of the story is the specific failure of an attack against a superior material.
*   **D) Foolish injuries...:** This doesn't fit the context of the file’s response.
*   **E) Boasting of strength...:** The viper wasn't responding to a boast; it initiated the conflict.

Therefore, the most accurate moral is that it is pointless to try to harm those who are much stronger or completely unaffected by your weapons.

As they were disputing, they passed a statue carv",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the interaction between the Man and the Lion:

1.  **The Conflict:** Both characters are arguing about who is superior in strength.
2.  **The Evidence:** The Man presents a statue as ""proof"" of human superiority because it shows a human defeating a lion.
3.  **The Rebuttal:** The Lion points out that the ""proof"" is biased because it was created by a human. He suggests that if a lion had created the art, the outcome depicted would be the opposite.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that ""truth"" or ""history"" is often shaped by the perspective of the storyteller. A single piece of evidence or a single narrative often only reflects the bias of the person presenting it.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) One story is good, till another is told:** This directly addresses the theme that there are two sides to every story and that perspective defines the narrative.
*   **B) The hero is brave in deeds...:** This doesn't fit, as the story is about representation/perspective, not bravery.
*   **C) Pride often precedes a fall:** While they are boasting, neither character actually ""falls"" at the end.
*   **D) Boastful outside show is a poor substitute...:** This is a moral for other fables (like The Dog in the Manger or certain versions of The Lion and the Statue), but A is a more direct fit for the ""perspective"" theme of this specific fable (often titled ""The Lion and the Statue"").
*   **E) Pride often blinds us to cooperation:** The story is about competition/perspective, not the lack of cooperation.

In many classical collections of Aesop's Fables, the moral attached to this story is that ""The same story looks different when told from a different point of view"" or ""One story is good, until another is told.""

On his way to the assembly of the birds, the peaco",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Character:** The peacock is described as beautiful, gentle, and courteous. 
2.  **The Transaction:** Other birds (the raven, crow, cuckoo) appeal to the peacock's desire for status and praise (""I will squawk your praises throughout the courts"").
3.  **The Action:** The peacock gives away pieces of his own protection (his feathers) in exchange for this hollow praise.
4.  **The Consequence:** By prioritizing the vanity of being praised and being overly ""courteous"" at his own expense, he loses his ability to protect himself and his family. He eventually dies due to the loss of his feathers.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Vanity can lead to self-destruction:** This fits well. The peacock gave away his essential feathers because he wanted the other birds to praise him. This vanity led directly to his inability to survive the winter.
*   **B) Do not boast to have something you do not:** The peacock actually had the feathers, so this doesn't apply.
*   **C) Opportunism can overshadow courtesy:** While true of the other birds, a moral usually focuses on the protagonist's failing. The peacock's ""courtesy"" was actually a lack of boundaries fueled by a desire for praise.
*   **D) Sorrow not over what is abandoned:** This is unrelated to the story's outcome.
*   **E) True beauty shines through kindness:** The story refutes this; the peacock's ""kindness"" (giving away feathers) led to his death and the suffering of his chicks.

While the story highlights a lack of boundaries, the catalyst for the peacock's decisions was the promise of ""praises throughout the courts."" His need for external validation (vanity) caused him to strip himself of what he needed to survive.

You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth as a w",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Conflict:** A small Gnat challenges a powerful Lion. By using his size to his advantage (attacking sensitive spots), the Gnat manages to make the Lion defeat himself through frustration and self-injury.
2.  **The Climax:** The Gnat is victorious and celebrates his superiority over ""the hugest beasts,"" displaying immense pride and a sense of invincibility.
3.  **The Resolution:** Immediately after his great victory, the Gnat is caught in a simple spiderweb. He realizes the irony: he defeated the king of beasts but fell to a ""most inconsiderable"" insect.

**Analysis of Choices:**
*   **A:** This fits well. The Gnat's bragging following his victory is immediately followed by a fatal mistake (flying into a web), showing that no matter how much one boasts of their power, they remain vulnerable.
*   **B:** This refers to a completely different fable (""The Wolf and the Crane"" or similar).
*   **C:** While pride is present, the ""frustration"" in the story belongs to the Lion, while the Gnat faces destruction/death, not just frustration.
*   **D:** The Gnat's cunning outwitted the Lion, but it didn't outwit himself; rather, his lack of vigilance (caused by his pride) led to his demise.
*   **E:** This is a secondary theme, but the core of the fable focuses on the downfall following a great success.

The classic moral of this Aesop's fable (*The Gnat and the Lion*) is that the greatest dangers can be found in the smallest things just when we feel most invincible, or that success should not lead to overconfidence. Choice A most closely captures the sentiment that a boaster’s triumph can be instantly undone by a trivial oversight.

morables_361,"Some fishermen had gone out fishing, and when they had struggled for a long time but had not managed to catch anything, they became very downcast and prepared to turn back. All of a sudden a tuna fish",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Effort:** The fishermen exert significant effort (""struggled for a long time"") using their professional skills and tools to catch fish.
2.  **The Failure:** Despite their skill and hard work, they catch nothing and are ready to give up. This demonstrates that skill alone does not always guarantee success.
3.  **The Event:** A tuna fish literally jumps into their boat. This happens not because of the fishermen's strategy or talent, but because of an external circumstance (the tuna fleeing a predator). 
4.  **The Outcome:** The fishermen achieve their goal (catching a fish) through unexpected good fortune rather than their own labor.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** This matches the narrative perfectly. The fishermen's ""skill"" failed them, but ""luck"" (the tuna leaping into the boat) provided the result.
*   **B:** This is a common moral for other fables (like those about large trees vs. small reeds), but it doesn't apply here, as the tuna was caught because it was being chased.
*   **C:** While the story ends in joy, this is a description of the mood transition rather than a moral lesson.
*   **D:** This choice is grammatically nonsensical and does not relate to the text.
*   **E:** The story actually shows that perseverance did *not* pay off; they were giving up when luck intervened.

The fable illustrates that chance or luck can sometimes provide what hard work and skill cannot. This is a classic Aesopic moral.

Not withstanding all his prayers, instead of becoming richer, he got poorer. Out ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Action:** A man prays to a Wooden Idol for wealth but grows poorer.
2.  **The Turning Point:** In a fit of frustration (and essentially abandoning his reverence/belief in the idol as a holy object), he smashes it.
3.  **The Result:** The physical act of destruction reveals the gold hidden inside.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The man realizes that the ""deity"" only gave him what he wanted through force, not through prayer.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **B, C, and D** focus on ""gracelessness"" or ""ugliness,"" but the story concludes with the man being ""transported at the sight"" of the gold. He isn't punished for his impatience; he is rewarded by it.
*   **E** suggests a hero's journey (boldness/fate), but the story is more cynical regarding the nature of the man's faith.
*   **A** captures the essence of the subtext often associated with this specific Aesop’s Fable (often titled ""The Man and the Wooden God""). The man spent's time worshipping while it served him, but as soon as he ""broke"" his faith and treated the idol as a mere object to be smashed, he profited. It highlights how the man's ""devotion"" was entirely tied to his financial gain; once the idol was smashed, he didn't mourn his god, he celebrated the profit.

In many classical interpretations of this fable, the moral is that some people are so perverse that they only respond to harshness/force rather than kindness, or that people's religious or philosophical commitments are often secondary to their material greed. Option A best reflects the shifting nature of the man's ""worship"" based on the outcome.

Then the little gnat said to the bull, 'It's enough for me that you have accepted my ch",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Challenge:** A tiny gnat challenges a massive bull. This is an inherently unequal pairing; the gnat has no physical way of defeating the bull in a contest of strength.
2.  **The Interaction:** By simply accepting the challenge, the bull validates the gnat as a peer. The gnat explicitly points this out: ""It's enough for me that you have accepted my challenge. This makes me your equal.""
3.  **The Result:** The gnat gains prestige and ""bragging rights"" just by being associated with the bull, while the bull gains nothing and actually loses status.
4.  **The Reflection:** The narrator concludes that if the bull had ignored the gnat (treating him as ""beneath contempt""), the gnat would have had nothing to boast about.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Accurate. By engaging with an unworthy opponent, the bull lowered his reputation to the gnat's level.
*   **B:** Irrelevant. The story is not about children or practical education.
*   **C:** While pride is involved, the specific lesson is about the *choice of opponent*, not a sudden fall from grace.
*   **D:** Nonsensical in the context of this story.
*   **E:** Close, but it doesn't capture the specific consequence mentioned—that the act of competing itself grants status to the inferior party.

The core lesson is that acknowledging an insignificant adversary gives them a status they haven't earned, thereby demeaning your own standing.

The owner began to question the dog, asking how he could be so ungra",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue between the owner and the dog:

1.  **The Conflict:** The owner claims to be kind because he has never personally raised a hand or a harsh word against the dog. He views himself as innocent of any cruelty.
2.  **The Dog's Rebuttal:** The dog points out that while the owner didn't physically strike him, the owner ordered others to do it. 
3.  **The Logic:** The dog concludes that the source of the order is just as responsible as the person carrying out the action. Whether the owner hits the dog himself or instructs a servant to do it, the result and the intent are the same.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the dog's argument. Delegating a task (specifically a cruel one) does not absolve the person in charge of the responsibility for that act.
*   **B:** While the owner's words are hypocritical, the core of the story is about the delegation of actions, not just ""danger"" in speech.
*   **C:** The story suggests the owner was *not* truly kind, so his kindness isn't being ""unappreciated""—his cruelty is being called out.
*   **D:** This does not fit the context of the dog being returned or the argument regarding the beating.
*   **E:** This is a plot detail (how the dog was found), not the moral lesson.

The fable teaches that one cannot escape the moral weight of an action by having someone else perform it.

1.  **The Situation:** A butcher enters a flock and begins taking sheep one by one to be slaughtered.
2.  **The Reaction:** The remaining sheep ignore the danger because it is not affecting them personally at that moment (""He keeps his hands off me... let him take whom he takes""). They fail to act collectively or show solidarity.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because they did not act when they had the numbers and the strength to overpower the butcher, they are picked off until only one remains.
4.  **The Lesson:** The final sheep realizes that their failure to protect one another led to their individual dooms. Had they stood up for the first sheep taken, they might have saved themselves.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A** directly reflects the theme of failing to support others, leading to a situation where there is no one left to support you. This is a classic ""First they came..."" narrative.
*   **B** refers to a different fable (like the frogs asking for a king).
*   **C** is a general truth but less specific to the mechanism of the sheep's failure (lack of collective action).
*   **D** and **E** do not fit the plot of the story.

1.  **Initial Success:** A hooligan commits a reckless act (striking Aesop). Instead of being punished immediately, he is rewarded with a coin and praise (""Well done!"").
2.  **The Trap:** This unearned reward creates a false sense of security and encourages him to repeat the behavior on a more dangerous target (a wealthy, important man).
3.  **The Ruin:** The hooligan, emboldened by his first ""success,"" repeats the act and is caught and executed.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Success leads many astray to their ruin.** This aligns perfectly with the text's conclusion: ""but his hope for a reward brought his reckless daring to ruin."" The initial ""success"" (the reward from Aesop) was what led him to commit the crime that resulted in his death.
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for.** This doesn't fit, as the hooligan didn't ""wish"" for something that had unintended consequences; he was incentivized to act.
*   **C) Clever minds outwit reckless wealth.** While Aesop is clever, the second man is not ""reckless wealth""; the hooligan is the reckless one.
*   **D) Avoid reckless overindulgence in manipulative pursuits.** This is overly complex and misidentifies the source of the ruin.
*   **E) Responding with grace can disarm hostility.** Aesop didn't respond with grace to disarm; he responded with a trick to ensure the hooligan was punished by a higher authority.

1.  **Winter's Perspective:** Winter prides itself on its power, comparing itself to a ""dictator or a despot."" It boasts about its ability to force people to stay indoors, tremble with fear, and look at the ground. Winter equates power with control and intimidation.
2.  **Spring's Perspective:** Spring highlights that Winter's approach makes people want to ""get rid of"" it. In contrast, Spring notes that its presence brings pleasure and people look forward to it with gratitude. 
3.  **The Lesson:** The fable contrasts two types of influence: one based on fear and restriction (Winter) and one based on joy and freedom (Spring). While Winter is powerful in a forceful way, Spring points out that being loved and welcomed is far more desirable than being a feared tyrant. 

Therefore:
- **A** is the correct choice because it directly addresses the comparison between Winter’s despotic fear and Spring’s beloved nature.
- **B** is irrelevant to the text.
- **C** is a theme, but the story clearly favors the ""beloved"" over the ""despotic.""
- **D** is incorrect because the characters are appreciated/unappreciated based on their conduct, not just talent.

Everyone wondered at this, since the new horse was neithe",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the key elements of the story:

1.  **The Premise:** A Soldier owns an ""excellent"" horse (proven, useful, and beautiful).
2.  **The Conflict:** He buys a new horse that is objectively ""not nearly as good"" (inferior in beauty and utility).
3.  **The Action:** He neglects the superior horse to give more care and attention to the inferior new one.
4.  **The Explanation:** A bystander notes that it is human nature to be ""fond of the newest arrival,"" implying a misplaced priority based on novelty rather than merit.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Everything pleases at first, but nothing pleases for long.** While the story touches on the novelty of things, it focuses more on the *preference* for the new over the better, rather than the eventual boredom with the new item.
*   **B) Everyone should be satisfied with their own lot...** This is unrelated to the soldier's choice to favor one horse over another.
*   **C) Beauty fades, but usefulness endures.** This contradicts the story, as the soldier is ignoring both beauty and usefulness.
*   **D) The inferior word of a wicked man...** This is unrelated to the narrative.
*   **E) We value what is less worthy more than what truly deserves our care.** This captures the essence of the soldier's behavior. He possesses something of high worth (the first horse) but directs his care toward something of lesser worth (the new horse) simply because it is new.

The fable illustrates the human tendency to be distracted by novelty, leading us to neglect superior things in favor of inferior ones.

A Kite saw him and exclaimed: 'You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no bus",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Event:** A seagull attempts to eat a fish that is too large for it. This results in a physical injury (bursting its gullet) that leads to its death. This highlights an act of overreaching or acting outside of one's natural limits/capacity.
2.  **The Commentary:** A Kite (another bird) observes the dying seagull. The Kite's criticism is specifically that the seagull (a bird of the air) should not have been seeking food from the sea.
3.  **The Core Lesson:** Historically, this Aesop's fable (*The Seagull and the Kite*) focuses on the idea of staying within one's own sphere or ""element."" The Kite points out that the disaster occurred because the seagull ventured into a domain (the deep sea/large fish) where it did not belong or could not safely operate. 

Let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Every man should be content to mind his own business:** This aligns with the Kite's observation that the bird should have stuck to its own ""business"" (the air) rather than the sea.
*   **B) Learn from past misfortunes:** The seagull dies, so it cannot learn from this misfortune.
*   **C) Greed breeds misfortune...:** While the seagull was greedy, the specific reprimand from the Kite focuses on the *nature* of the business being conducted.
*   **D) How often do we supply our unfortunate enemies...:** This relates to a different fable (*The Eagle and the Arrow*).
*   **E) Patience is key...:** There is no theme of waiting or patience here.

In the context of classical literature, this fable is most commonly used to illustrate that one should stay within their own station or sphere of expertise.

1.  **The Situation:** A group of foxes is thirsty, but the river is dangerous. Everyone is cautious because of the strong current.
2.  **The Action:** One fox decides to show off. She isn't motivated by a safe way to drink, but by the desire to ""embarrass her fellow foxes"" and prove she is ""braver than the rest.""
3.  **The Consequence:** She overestimates her ability and leaps into the rushing water, only to be swept away by the current.
4.  **The Reaction:** When her companions point out her failure (by mockingly asking her to show them the way), she makes up a face-saving excuse (""I have a message for Miletus"") to hide the fact that she is actually drowning or being swept away against her will.

Looking at the options:
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The fox's boasting and desire to show off led her to take a reckless risk that resulted in her being swept away.
*   **B:** There is no mention of profit or greed in the story.
*   **C:** Boldness did not quench any thirst here; it led to the fox being swept away.
*   **D:** While there is mocking, the core of the story is about the fox's own reckless display of ""bravery"" leading to her own peril.
*   **E:** The story demonstrates that the ""courage"" shown was actually foolishness/bravado, not a wise trait.

The fable (attributed to Aesop) is intended to mock those who bring disaster upon themselves through empty boasting and then try to pretend they intended the disastrous result all along.

1.  **The Lion’s Conflict:** The lion attempts to be a fair king and suppress his predatory instincts, but his nature eventually overrides his resolution. 
2.  **The Trap:** He creates a ""no-win"" situation for his subjects. He asks if his breath smells. Those who are honest (saying it smells bad) and those who are polite/dishonest (saying it smells good) are both killed. This demonstrates that regardless of their response, the outcome remains the same because the lion is looking for any excuse to satisfy his hunger.
3.  **The Monkey’s Case:** The monkey uses extreme flattery (""scent of cinnamon/altar of gods""). This initially pauses the lion, but the lion simply invents a different excuse (faking an illness) to eat the monkey anyway. 
4.  **Conclusion:** The central theme is that when dealing with a powerful and determined predator or tyrant, the specific words or actions of the victim do not change their fate. Honesty, lies, and flattery all lead to the same result.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The story illustrates that whether the animals were honest, dishonest, or excessively flattering, they were slaughtered just the same. 
*   **B:** There is no mention of ""old friends"" vs ""new acquaintances.""
*   **C:** This focuses on the monkey's flattery, but the story is more about the lion's inescapable predatory nature regardless of the victim's behavior.
*   **D:** This focuses on the ""fool,"" whereas the story focuses on the inevitability of the lion's appetite.
*   **E:** This is the opposite of the story's cynical ending.

The lesson is that one cannot escape a predator's nature; whether you speak the truth or use flattery, the powerful will find a way to justify their desires.

The partridge immediately started squawking his usual song, sauntering through every room in the house un",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the conflict between the partridge and the weasel:

1.  **The Partridge’s Actions:** The partridge is a newcomer who immediately makes himself at home. He is loud (""squawking,"" ""cackling"") and moves freely through every room as if he owns the place, despite having just arrived.
2.  **The Weasel’s Argument:** The weasel, a long-term resident (born in the house), points out the social impropriety of the bird's behavior. The weasel argues that even a regular member of the household remains quiet and humble, whereas the newcomer is being loud and boastful without having earned his place.
3.  **The Underlying Lesson:** The fable contrasts the arrogance of a newcomer with the expected humility of someone entering a new environment. The weasel's critique centers on the fact that the partridge has not observed the ""quiet"" status quo of the household.

Looking at the options:
*   **A)** Directly addresses the need for a newcomer to respect the existing environment and behavioral standards.
*   **D)** While the partridge is vain, the story focuses more on the breach of social etiquette and ""newcomer"" status rather than self-destruction (though the weasel is ""tricky,"" the fable ends with the verbal rebuke). 
*   **B, C, and E)** Do not align with the specific interaction regarding the length of residency and the noise level.

In many classical collections of Aesop’s fables, this story (sometimes titled ""The Partridge and the Weasel"") is used to illustrate that those who have recently entered a situation should be modest and observe the customs of those who were there before them.

Stung by the sharp pain,",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** The fox is in a moment of vulnerability and reaches out for help/stability to avoid a fall.
2.  **The Action:** She grabs a bramble bush—a plant naturally characterized by its thorns and its tendency to hook onto or ""catch"" anything that touches it.
3.  **The Conflict:** The fox is hurt by the bramble and complains, expecting the bush to have been supportive or gentle because the fox was in need.
4.  **The Resolution/Lesson:** The bramble explains that its very nature is to ""grab"" or harm others. It is the nature of the bush to be prickly.

**Analysis of choices:**
*   **B, C, and D** address themes like boasting or specific skills that are not the primary focus of this interaction.
*   **E** is a reasonable secondary lesson (be careful where you lean), but fables usually focus on the character/nature of the entities involved.
*   **A** is the most accurate. The fox made the mistake of expecting a harmful, ""clinging"" plant to act against its own nature to provide kind assistance. The story warns us that we should not expect kindness or help from those whose character is inherently hurtful or antagonistic.

The moral is that it is foolish to expect help from someone who is naturally harmful or unkind.

But the fuller told him, 'How on earth would I be able to carr",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the characters and their conflict:

1.  **The Characters:** A charcoal burner (whose job involves soot, black dust, and smoke) and a fuller (whose job involves cleaning cloth and making it white/bright).
2.  **The Conflict:** The charcoal burner suggests living together for convenience or companionship. 
3.  **The Resolution:** The fuller rejects the offer because the fundamental nature of their work is contradictory. One person’s output (cleanliness) would be ruined by the other person’s environment (soot).
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that people with incompatible lifestyles, habits, or natures cannot successfully share a life or a space because their presence or actions will negate one another.

Looking at the options:
- **A) Opposites are utterly incompatible:** This fits the story perfectly. The central theme is that two things (black soot and white cloth) cannot coexist without one destroying the other's work.
- **B) Appearances can be deceiving:** This is not relevant; the story is about actual results and nature, not deception.
- **C) Caution cleans inconsiderate actions:** This is phrasing that doesn't align with the logic of the story.
- **D) Clean honesty is the best cautious policy:** While the fuller is honest, the core of the fable is about incompatibility, not just honesty.
- **E) Shared spaces require shared understanding:** While true in a general sense, the ""fuller and charcoal burner"" fable specifically highlights the impossibility of union between fundamentally different natures.

In many classical collections of Aesop's fables, the moral associated with this story is often translated as: ""Like will not associate with unlike"" or ""Opposites are incompatible.""

Some travellers coming from the opposite direction asked the man how he",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Action:** A murderer attempts to hide his crime by blaming an innocent object (the mulberry tree), claiming the blood on his hands came from the tree's fruit.
2.  **The Consequence:** The murderer is captured and executed specifically on the tree he tried to slander.
3.  **The Dialogue:** The tree speaks at the end, explicitly stating its lack of pity because the man tried to ""smear"" it with a crime he committed.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **B, C, and D** do not align with the specific themes of slander and the tree's ""retaliation"" or lack of mercy.
*   **E** is a thematic observation about the story, but it doesn't capture the specific lesson regarding the irony of the punishment.
*   **A** captures the essence of the story’s conclusion. The mulberry tree represents an ""honest"" entity that has been slandered. The fable illustrates that those who are falsely accused or slandered will not only fail to protect the guilty party but will actively participate in (or be glad of) their downfall. In classical interpretations of this Aesop fable (The Murderer and the Mulberry Tree), the moral focuses on how even the naturally peaceful turn against those who attempt to shift their guilt onto them.

The tree (symbolizing an honest party) does not hesitate to facilitate the execution of the one who tried to defame it.

morables_430,Some field-mice were playing in the woods where a lion was sleeping when one of the mice accidentally ran over the lion. The lion woke up and immediately grabbed the wretched little mouse with his paw,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the progression of the plot:

1.  **The Act of Mercy:** The lion, a powerful creature, chooses to show mercy to a tiny, weak mouse. He believes the mouse is too insignificant for the kill to bring him any ""glory,"" yet he chooses kindness over destruction.
2.  **The Reversal of Fortune:** The lion, despite his strength, becomes helpless when caught in a hunter's trap.
3.  **The Repayment:** The mouse, despite his small size, uses his specific talents (gnawing) to save the lion. He explicitly states that he is doing this because he has ""not forgotten the kindness"" the lion showed him.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted:** This fits perfectly. The lion's ""small"" act of letting a tiny creature go resulted in his own life being saved later. It emphasizes that even the small and weak can repay a debt of gratitude.
*   **B) Unequal matches bring misery:** Incorrect; this story shows a positive outcome from an interaction between unequal creatures.
*   **C) Cleverness can free the trapped:** While the mouse was clever/skilled, the core of the story is about the cycle of kindness and gratitude, not just the mechanism of the escape.
*   **D) Those who act in their own innocent self-interest...:** Incorrect; the mouse was acting out of genuine gratitude, not deceptive self-interest.
*   **E) Even the smallest actions can awaken great consequences:** While true, this is too broad. This specific fable is a classic illustration of how mercy is rewarded.

The most accurate moral for Aesop’s ""The Lion and the Mouse"" is that mercy and kindness are always worthwhile, as you never know when you might need help from someone you previously helped.

1.  **The Situation:** The Pigeons are afraid of a Kite (a bird of prey).
2.  **The Action:** They seek a ""remedy"" for their fear by inviting a Hawk (a much more powerful and dangerous bird of prey) into their home for protection.
3.  **The Result:** The Hawk kills far more Pigeons in a single day than the Kite ever could have in a year.
4.  **The Lesson:** The solution the Pigeons chose was significantly more destructive than the original problem they were trying to solve.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The Hawk (remedy) was far more lethal than the Kite (disease).
*   **B) The conflicts of the wicked...:** Not applicable here; it wasn't a conflict between the Kite and Hawk that saved anyone.
*   **C) Deception often masks destruction:** While the Hawk was predatory, the story focuses more on the poor judgment of the Pigeons in choosing such a dangerous protector rather than a specific ""trick"" by the Hawk.
*   **D) When your deceptive adversary is also your judge...:** This refers to a different fable (usually ""The Wolf and the Lamb"").
*   **E) Choose allies wisely...:** While close, this is a broader thematic takeaway. Option A is the classical, concise moral associated with this specific Aesop's fable (""The Kites and the Swans"" or ""The Pigeons and the Hawk"").

The most precise summary of the story's logic is that the cure was worse than the ailment.

morables_394,"When Zeus had fashioned man and woman, he ordered Hermes to take them to Gaia, the Earth, and to show them how to obtain food by digging in the ground. At first, the Earth refused to cooperate in Herm",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this fable, let's analyze the core components of the narrative:

1.  **The Origin:** Zeus creates humans and intends for them to survive by farming (digging in the Earth).
2.  **The Conflict:** The Earth (Gaia) is reluctant to yield her resources and only does so under compulsion from the gods.
3.  **The Consequence:** Gaia grants the humans the ability to extract food, but she explicitly ties this gain to ""groans and tears.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Easy gains often come with hidden costs and hardships.** This aligns with Gaia's warning. While humans get the food (the gain), it is not truly ""easy"" (it requires digging) and comes with a heavy price of suffering and labor.
*   **B) Do not fight with those who are perfectly capable of fighting back.** This isn't the primary focus, as humans aren't ""fighting"" Gaia, they are simply trying to survive based on Zeus's decree.
*   **C) Power can sway the reluctant.** While true that Hermes compels Gaia, the *meaning* of the story usually focuses on the human condition (the result of the interaction) rather than the mechanics of the gods' power.
*   **D) Powerful physical stature...** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **E) Guidance is the seed of self-sufficiency.** This is too optimistic for the tone of the fable, which focuses on the curse of labor.

Traditional interpretations of this Aesop's fable (often titled ""Zeus, Hermes, and the Earth"") emphasize that human survival is inherently linked to toil and sorrow. The ""gain"" of food from the earth is inseparable from the ""cost"" of hard labor.

So if you eve",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the character interactions and the outcome:

1.  **The Action:** A dog steals a piece of meat (a heart) from a butcher. This is an act of cleverness or bold theft that momentarily succeeds.
2.  **The Reaction:** The butcher realizes he was caught off-guard. Instead of simply being angry, he uses wordplay (""You haven't stolen my heart; indeed, I have taken heart from this lesson"").
3.  **The Lesson for the Butcher:** He has learned to be more vigilant. The ""heart"" he gained is courage or wisdom derived from the experience of being robbed.
4.  **The Warning:** He explicitly states that because he has learned this lesson, the dog will not succeed a second time; rather, the dog will be punished.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Experience teaches valuable lessons and encourages caution:** This aligns perfectly with the butcher's statement. He used the negative experience of the theft to gain ""heart"" (wisdom/caution) for the future.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** This usually applies to stories where a character cannot change their inherent traits (like a wolf in sheep’s clothing), which isn't the primary focus here.
*   **C) Boldness without caution leads astray:** While the dog was bold, the story concludes with the butcher’s perspective on learning a lesson.
*   **D) & E):** These options do not reflect the butcher's specific dialogue regarding ""taking heart"" or learning from the event.

The core of the fable is that a single misfortune or mistake can serve as a powerful teacher, ensuring one is not caught unaware again.

When he saw a hard-working bull who was pulling a plow, the bullock said to him, 'You poor",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** A young, idle bullock mocks an older, hardworking bull for the ""hard work"" he must endure. The bullock prides himself on his freedom and lack of labor.
2.  **The Reversal:** When the time for sacrifice arrives, the hardworking bull—having proven his value through labor—is released to pasture. The idle bullock, who was only kept idle to be fattened for slaughter, is led to his death.
3.  **The Resolution:** The older bull points out that the bullock's ""easy life"" was actually a preparation for a much worse fate. The bullock’s earlier mockery was premature and misplaced.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) He laughs best that laughs last:** This fits perfectly. The bullock laughed at the bull initially, but the bull ended up in the better position at the end of the story.
*   **B) The great do not always prevail:** This does not fit, as it's not a struggle between ""great"" and ""small.""
*   **C) Wisdom tempers youthful naivety:** While true in a general sense, the story focuses specifically on the reversal of fortunes and the consequence of the bullock’s mockery.
*   **D) He that is neither...:** This is nonsensical in this context.
*   **E) One should not judge others...:** While applicable, it is less specific to the ironic ""twist"" of the ending than Option A.

In traditional Aesopic collections, this fable (*The Bullock and the Ox*) is most commonly associated with the lesson that idleness often leads to a quick end, while hard work leads to security, or more simply, that one should not boast or mock others before the final outcome is known. ""He laughs best that laughs last"" captures the irony of the bullock's downfall following his mockery.

A man who was planning to make such a voyage had brought his monkey along with him,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Context:** A monkey is being saved by a dolphin who mistakes him for a human.
2.  **The Deception:** To appear more impressive or to maintain the dolphin's high regard, the monkey lies about his origins, claiming to be from an illustrious Athenian family.
3.  **The Mistake:** When asked about ""Piraeus"" (the harbor), the monkey—trying to maintain his lie—claims Piraeus is a person and a ""dear friend.""
4.  **The Consequence:** The dolphin realizes the monkey is a fraud and an impostor. Because of this deception, the dolphin stops helping the monkey and drowns him.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The monkey ""pretends to be what he is not"" and literally ends up in ""deep water"" (plunged into the sea). The phrase is a pun on both the literal situation and the metaphorical consequence of lying.
*   **B:** There is nothing in the text comparing one man to a crowd.
*   **C:** The plans in the story did not calm infuriation; the monkey’s lie caused it.
*   **D:** While the dolphin was infuriated, the core message is about the failure of the monkey's pretension, not the complexity of truth-telling.
*   **E:** Companionship failed here because it was built on a lie.

The story serves as a warning against boasting and false pretension.

Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Predicament:** The mice realize the Cat is their predator after she eats many of them.
2.  **The Precaution:** Because they have been hunted (deceived into a sense of safety initially, then attacked), the mice retreat to their holes and refuse to come out.
3.  **The Trick:** The Cat attempts a second deception by pretending to be dead (hanging from a peg).
4.  **The Resolution:** The mice are not fooled. One mouse explains that even if the Cat transformed into something harmless (a meal-bag), they would still stay away because they have already learned she is a threat.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) He who is once deceived is doubly cautious:** This fits the behavior of the mice perfectly. Having experienced the danger of the Cat once, they are now so cautious that no amount of trickery or disguise will entice them out.
*   **B) Beware of when the powerful and the deceitful collaborate:** There is only one antagonist (the Cat) acting alone; there is no ""collaboration.""
*   **C) Caution tempers cunning:** While somewhat relevant, it is less specific than A. The story is specifically about how past experience with a predator creates lasting vigilance.
*   **D) Relying too much on cunning subordinates...:** There are no subordinates in this story.
*   **E) Unchecked problems...:** This describes the Cat's arrival, but not the ultimate lesson learned by the survivor.

The fable (attributed to Aesop as ""The Cat and the Mice"") traditionally concludes with the lesson that those who have been caught or threatened once are not easily fooled again by the same person, even in a different guise.

1.  **The Situation:** A traveler falls asleep on the edge of a deep well. This is a reckless action caused by his own fatigue and lack of foresight.
2.  **The Interaction:** Dame Fortune (Fate/Luck) wakes him up. She does not do this out of pure altruism, but to protect her own reputation.
3.  **The Lesson:** Dame Fortune explicitly states that humans often blame ""bad luck"" or ""fate"" for their misfortunes, even when those misfortunes are actually the result of their own foolish decisions or lack of care. 

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Everyone is more or less master of his own fate:** This aligns with the text. The Traveler's danger was caused by his own choice to sleep in a dangerous spot, not by random bad luck.
*   **B) Every tale is not to be believed:** This is unrelated to the content.
*   **C) Guard your energy wisely:** While the traveler was weary, the story focuses on the *consequences* and the *blame* of his actions rather than the management of his energy.
*   **D) He who incites to concerned strife...:** This is the moral for a different fable (""The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner"").
*   **E) Exhaustion can lead to perilous oversight:** This is a literal observation of the plot, but not the overarching ""moral"" regarding human nature and responsibility that Dame Fortune expresses.

The fable teaches that people should take responsibility for their own actions instead of blaming ""Fortune"" when things go wrong due to their own negligence.

1.  **The Request:** A man (the potential antagonist to the trees) asks his future victims for the tool necessary to harm them (a handle).
2.  **The Cooperation:** The trees, acting in a spirit of helpfulness or perhaps naivety, provide the very thing he needs to destroy them.
3.  **The Consequence:** Once the man has the handle, he uses the completed axe to chop down the trees.
4.  **The Realization:** The trees recognize that their own contribution enabled their destruction.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A) You should think twice before offering anything to your enemies.** This fits the narrative perfectly. The trees enabled their enemy, leading to their downfall.
- **B) It is better to be injured with impunity...** This doesn't quite match the voluntary nature of the trees' mistake.

- **E) A stubborn quest...** This is unrelated to the themes of the fable.

In Aesop's Fables, this story (often titled ""The Woodman and the Trees"") is traditionally used to warn against providing the means of your own destruction to those who would do you harm. The trees' mistake was failing to recognize that helping the man once would lead to their permanent ruin.

The crab said to her, 'O mother, lead the way, and I will try to walk accordingly.",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the steps and the interactions between the characters:

1.  **The Action:** The mother crab criticizes her son for his natural way of walking (sideways/crooked) and instructs him to walk straight.
2.  **The Response:** The son challenges his mother to demonstrate the behavior herself so that he may follow her lead.
3.  **The Outcome:** The mother is unable to perform the very task she demanded of her son because it is contrary to her nature.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the hypocrisy of giving instructions or ""precepts"" that the teacher cannot or does not follow themselves. It suggests that if you want someone to behave a certain way, you must be able to demonstrate it through your own actions.

*   **A) Example is more powerful than precept:** This fits perfectly. A ""precept"" is a rule or instruction. The mother gave a precept but could not provide the ""example.""
*   **B) Contentment:** The story isn't about being happy with what one has; it's about instruction and behavior.
*   **C) Guiding others astray:** While the mother failed to guide him correctly, the core of the story is about the failure to lead by example.
*   **D) Hypocritical equals:** The characters are mother/son (not equals/friends), and the focus is on the failure of leadership/parenting.

morables_383,A wolf had assembled an immense store of booty in his den so that he could feast on all sorts of delicacies for months into the future. When the fox found out about this she paid a visit to the wolf a,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the characters and their actions:

1.  **The Wolf:** He is a thief who has hoarded an ""immense store of booty"" (stolen goods). He is also spiteful and paranoid, which causes him to alienate the fox.
2.  **The Fox:** She is a deceiver who initially tries to trick the wolf out of his food. When rebuffed, she turns to betrayal, leading a shepherd to kill the wolf so she can steal the hidden hoard.
3.  **The Outcome:** The wolf (a thief) is killed by the shepherd through the fox's betrayal. The fox (another thief/deceiver) is eventually killed by hunters as a consequence of her actions.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) Take pleasure when thieves destroy themselves:** This aligns with the cyclical nature of the story. Both the wolf and the fox are ""thieves"" (one of goods, one of lives/trust). The story illustrates the ""serious crime"" of the fox leading to her own death after she caused the wolf's death. It suggests that when villains turn on one another, it leads to their mutual destruction. This is a common moral in Aesop’s fables regarding the ""wicked.""
*   **B) Never trust a known deceiver:** While true, the story's climax is more about the consequences the fox faces for her betrayal rather than the wolf's lack of trust (the wolf actually *didn't* trust her).
*   **C) Gratitude tempers relentless spite:** The story shows the opposite; spite led to betrayal and death.
*   **D) Cunning wit has always a spiteful answer ready:** This describes the wolf's dialogue, but it doesn't encompass the fox's fate or the ultimate lesson.
*   **E) Isolation in abundance can lead to unexpected companionship:** This is Factually incorrect within the context of the story’s ending.

The story traditionally serves as a warning that those who live by deception and theft—and who turn on their own kind—will eventually meet a destructive end. The fox's final lament (""Just as I committed a serious crime, now I am going to die"") reinforces that the destruction of these ""thieves"" is a fitting end to their nature.

morables_91,An Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it. But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; ,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this story, let's break down the sequence of events:

1.  **The Good Deed:** The eagle is in a life-and-death struggle with a serpent. A countryman intervenes to help the eagle, freeing it and allowing it to escape.
2.  **The Retaliation:** The serpent seeks revenge on the man by poisoning his water.
3.  **The Reciprocated Good Turn:** Just as the man is about to drink the poison, the eagle (which the man had previously saved) intervenes by knocking the horn out of his hand, saving the man's life in return.

The story highlights a cycle of gratitude and mutual aid. Because the man saved the eagle, the eagle returned the favor by saving the man. This concept is most accurately summarized by the common proverb ""One good turn deserves another.""

While other options touch on elements of the story (like the serpent's vengeance), they do not capture the core lesson of the interaction between the man and the eagle.

- **A) One good turn deserves another:** Reflects the reciprocal saving of lives.
- **B) Do not try to grasp too much at once:** Irrelevant to the plot.
- **C) Quick actions can be vengeful:** Only describes the serpent, not the ultimate point of the story.
- **D) Destroy the swift seed...:** This is the moral for a different fable (""The Swallow and the Other Birds"").
- **E) Even the mighty must be wary...:** Though the eagle was ""mighty"" and caught, the focus of the resolution is the man being saved as a reward for his kindness.

His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, My master gives a feast, a",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Invitation:** A guest (the stranger dog) enters a house not by the invitation of the host (the Rich Man), but through an unofficial channel (the master's dog).
2.  **The Entrance:** The dog enters the kitchen/house ""behind the scenes"" to take advantage of resources he was not formally invited to enjoy.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he has no legitimate right to be there, the Cook treats him as an intruder and throws him out the window.
4.  **The Moral Meaning:** The phrase ""enter by the back stairs"" is a metaphor for seeking admittance or favors through unofficial, illegitimate, or sneaky means. The story illustrates that those who try to benefit from a situation they haven't been invited into can expect a sudden and unceremonious exit.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the ""unofficial"" entry and the resulting ""unofficial"" exit (the window). This matches the traditional moral attributed to this Aesop's fable.
*   **B:** There were no enemies in the story; the master's dog was a friend.
*   **C:** Generosity is present, but the story focuses on the consequences of the uninvited guest, not the hope of the host.
*   **D:** There was no ""deceitful promise of safety,"" only an offer of food that the dog accepted at his own risk.
*   **E:** While generosity *did* extend (the dog inviting a friend), the story's outcome warns against the guest's behavior rather than praising the extension of generosity.

He ordered that the bag of coins be brought to him as he was dying and then asked",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the key elements:
1.  **The Character:** A ""miserly man"" with ""ill-gotten"" wealth.
2.  **The Situation:** He is dying and realizes his hoarding and labor are ending.
3.  **The Outcome:** The money explains that the man’s suffering (the ""sweat"" and ""eternal torments"") resulted in no personal benefit. Instead, the gains will be squandered by others, and he will face supernatural punishment for how he acquired and kept them.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** While the story touches on greed, it specifically emphasizes the *nature* of the gains (""ill-gotten"") and the specific consequence of ""eternal torments"" given by the demons.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; this refers to a different fable (like the Frogs asking for a King).
*   **C:** This directly mirrors the climax of the story. The bag explicitly states it brings pleasure to demons because the man's soul is going to ""eternal torments"" as a result of his life and his ""ill-gotten"" heap.
*   **D:** This refers to a completely different fable (like the Fox and the Lion).
*   **E:** While technically true, it is too vague. The story focuses heavily on the moral weight of how the money was gained and the spiritual punishment involved.

In the context of traditional fables (this one is attributed to Odo of Cheriton), the core lesson is that those who acquire wealth through sinful or greedy means face a double tragedy: they lose the wealth to ungrateful heirs and lose their souls to punishment. Therefore, **C** is the most precise moral.

1.  **The Contrast:** The story establishes a contrast between the life of the country mouse (humble, simple food like acorns, but safe and free) and the life of the city mouse (luxurious delicacies, but filled with danger and fear).
2.  **The Conflict:** While enjoying the abundance of the city, a threat appears (the butler). The city mouse is safe because he knows where to hide, but the country mouse is terrified and realizes that the ""wealth"" of the food comes at the cost of his peace of mind and safety.
3.  **The Conclusion:** The country mouse explicitly states that he prefers his ""acorns"" (poverty/simplicity) as long as he is ""secure in his freedom"" (peace/safety). He rejects the city mouse's wealth because it is accompanied by ""torment"" and ""scare.""

Evaluating the options:
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the country mouse’s final sentiment. He chooses a simple, poor life over a wealthy one that causes anxiety and danger.
*   **B:** While generally true, it’s too broad for the specific themes of this fable.
*   **C:** This describes a plot point (the city mouse knowing his hole), but it is not the *lesson* or moral.
*   **D:** This is a proverb about treachery, which does not apply here.
*   **E:** This describes the plot's inciting incident rather than the moral lesson.

The moral centers on the idea that a simple life of peace is superior to a life of luxury filled with fear.

The beetle then felt contem",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative arc:

1.  **The Conflict**: The beetle becomes dissatisfied with his nature (""not quite bugs and not quite birds"") after observing the superior capabilities of an eagle. 
2.  **The Hubris**: He arrogance leads him to believe his voice and appearance are equal to the eagle's and that he can simply choose to leave his ""lowly"" life to join the society of superior creatures.
3.  **The Failure**: He attempts to live outside his nature and capabilities. He fails to endure the environment (high winds) and the physical demands of his ambition.
4.  **The Consequence**: He ends up far from home, starving, and regretful. He realizes that his previous life, which he held in contempt, was actually where he belonged and where his needs were met.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A**: This matches the story perfectly. The beetle was ""arrogant"" (putting himself on the level of an eagle), ""put on airs"" (imitating a bird's song), and lost his former comfort (the dung heap) while failing to achieve his new goal.
*   **B**: This refers to a different Aesop fable (*The Eagle and the Beetle*), where the beetle gets revenge on the eagle for eating a hare. It does not fit this specific text.
*   **C**: The story warns *against* trying to be something you are not, rather than encouraging the merging of different groups.
*   **D**: This suggests a need for violence or physical force to back up ambition, which is not present in the beetle's story.
*   **E**: While the beetle has a moment of wonder, the story is a cautionary tale about the negative outcome of that wonder when it turns into misplaced ambition.

The story teaches that one should be content with their natural state and that overreaching through arrogance leads to the loss of one's security.

1.  **The Conflict:** The protagonist finds an object of immense value (a gold lion) but is paralyzed by a conflict between his greed (desire for the gold) and his cowardice (fear of the lion's form, despite it being a statue/object).
2.  **The Result of the Conflict:** Because of his cowardice, he cannot bring himself to touch or claim the treasure. Even though he has found ""fortune,"" he experiences ""no satisfaction"" because his nature prevents him from interacting with it.
3.  **The Resolution:** He decides to stay at a distance and have others take the risk for him. This emphasizes that he personally cannot benefit from the wealth due to his fear.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **B, C, D, and E:** While these touch on themes within the story (greed and indecision), they do not capture the central irony. 
*   **A: Wealth is of little value if one is too afraid to use or enjoy it.** This is the classic moral associated with this Aesopic fable (often titled ""The Coward and the Golden Lion""). It highlights that external fortune is useless to a person whose internal character (cowardice) prevents them from seizing or enjoying it. The protagonist explicitly says, ""O treasure that offers no satisfaction!"" because his fear outweighs his ability to possess it.

morables_615,"At one time, it seemed to all the beasts that they should hold a meeting and assembly, as there were frequent complaints among them about one another. When opinions were exchanged back and forth, the ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"In this fable, the hares argue for a system based on equality and fairness to protect the weak from the strong. The lions respond by pointing out that the hares lack the physical power (claws and teeth) to enforce such a demand. This highlights a cynical but realistic observation about the nature of power: ideals and arguments for equality mean little if they are not backed by the strength to defend them or the power to enforce them.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. **The Hares' Argument:** They propose equality so the ""inferior"" are not preyed upon by the ""superior."" This is a moral argument for fairness.
2. **The Lions' Rebuttal:** The lions acknowledge the beauty of the words but dismiss them immediately because the hares lack the physical force to demand such terms from those who hold the power.
3. **The Lesson:** The story teaches that a position or a demand for rights is effectively toothless unless you have the means to back it up or defend it.

Choice **A** captures this sentiment: the hares were right in theory, but because they were unprepared to defend their position with actual power, their words were ignored. Choice C and D represent the hares' perspective, which the story ultimately shows to be ineffective in the face of raw power. Choice B reflects a the moral of a different fable (like *The Lion and the Mouse*), and Choice E is about the process rather than the outcome.

There was a whole crowd of monkeys there and one of them ,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character motivations:

1.  **The Setting:** The men are in a land governed by an animal (the monkey) who is mimicking human structures of power (the emperor). This establishes that the environment is built on a false pretension of status.
2.  **The Liar’s Success:** The first traveler recognizes that the leader wants to be flattered. By telling elaborate lies that validate the monkey's ego, he is rewarded. This shows that those who desire a false image (deceivers/the deceived) reward those who feed their delusion.
3.  **The Truth-Teller’s Logic:** The second man assumes that if a lie earns a reward, the truth must merit a greater one. He fails to account for the nature of his audience.
4.  **The Reaction:** When faced with the objective truth (""You are simply a monkey""), the leader feels insulted rather than enlightened. Because the truth shatters the illusion he has created, he retaliates with violence.

**Reviewing the options:**
*   **B** and **D** are irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C** is partially true, but the story focuses more on the *consequence* for the truth-teller rather than the foolishness of the monkey.
*   **E** is contradicted by the text; truth was not a defense—it led to the man’s injury.
*   **A** accurately reflects the conflict: The monkey leader thrives on the deception of being an emperor and punishes the man who dares to speak the truth.

The lesson is that in an environment where vanity and deception are prized, the truth is often perceived as a threat and met with hostility.

This slave-woman, bedecked with gold and trailing a delicate purple robe aro",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this story, let's look at the core conflict and the resolution provided by the goddess Aphrodite.

1.  **The Situation**: A man is obsessed with an ""ugly, wicked"" slave-woman. He treats her as if she were a queen, providing her with gold and finery, which she uses to bully his legitimate wife.
2.  **The Misconception**: The slave-woman believes her good fortune is a result of Aphrodite making her beautiful or favoring her.
3.  **The Divine Rebuttal**: Aphrodite intervenes specifically to distance herself from the situation. She clarifies that she did *not* make the woman beautiful. In fact, her tone is one of disgust: she is ""furious"" that the man possesses such poor judgment that he finds an ugly, wicked person attractive or ""worth looking at.""

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A**: This reflects the classical Greek sentiment present in the fable (often attributed to Aesop). The goddess views the man’s attraction not as a blessing from her, but as a sign of a disordered mind or a divine ""curse"" of bad taste.
*   **B**: There is no mention of a guilty conscience in the text.
*   **C**: The story explicitly states the woman is both ugly and wicked; her ""generous"" treatment by the man does not make her better, it makes her more arrogant.
*   **D**: The slave-woman is not beautiful, so this does not fit.
*   **E**: The story emphasizes that the woman is wicked and ugly both outside and in; the goddess expresses no appreciation for her.

The fable serves as a commentary on the ""blindness"" of love and suggests that when someone finds beauty in something objectively ugly or wicked, it is a sign of folly or being forsaken by the gods of beauty.

Aesop therefore shared this little story with the father,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the context and the specific advice given by Aesop.

1.  **The Conflict:** A father has a son with a ""vicious adolescent temper"" who is causing harm to others in the household.
2.  **The Farmer's Analogy:** The farmer yokes a steady, old bull to a wild, young bull. The purpose is not to make the old bull work harder, but to use the old bull’s presence to ""keep the young bull in check"" because the young one is causing injury to others.
3.  **The Direct Lesson:** Aesop tells the father that he must keep the boy beside him so that the father's ""moderation"" (mildness/wisdom/restraint) can restrain the boy's ""reckless inclinations."" 
4.  **Assessing the Options:**
    *   **A: A mild disposition can put a stop to vicious behaviour.** This is the core of the advice. By pairing the calm father with the violent son, the father's restraint/moderation acts as the corrective force.
    *   **B:** Irrelevant. The story is not about mocking the elderly.
    *   **C: Wisdom tempers reckless aggression.** While ""moderation"" and ""wisdom"" are similar, option A more accurately reflects the ""yoking"" aspect of using a calm nature to curb a violent one. However, the story emphasizes the *moderation* of the elder as the restraining tool. 
    *   **D:** This is the moral of *The Tortoise and the Hare*, not this story.
    *   **E:** While true that unchecked behavior leads to harm, the specific lesson Aesop provides is the *solution* (pairing moderation with aggression), rather than just a warning.

In Aesopic fables, particularly this one (Perry Index 531), the specific point is that the proximity of a calm, moderate influence can regulate and suppress a violent or wild nature. ""Moderation"" is synonymous with ""mild disposition"" in this context.

1.  **The Situation:** A ship has capsized during a storm, and the passengers are in the water fighting for their lives.
2.  **The Athenian's Action:** He relies entirely on divine intervention, praying and making promises to the goddess Athena instead of physically trying to save himself.
3.  **The Other Passenger's Advice:** He points out that while prayer is fine, the Athenian must also ""move his arms""—i.e., swim. 

The lesson is that faith or outside help is not a substitute for personal exertion. This fable is the origin of the famous proverb, ""Athena helps those who help themselves"" (or the more modern ""God helps those who help themselves""). 

Comparing the options:
*   **A) Self-effort is essential:** This directly addresses the theme that one must put in work alongside asking for help.
*   **B) A learned man has always a fund of riches in himself:** This is the moral of a different Aesop fable about a shipwrecked man who survives because of his skills/education.
*   **C, D, and E:** While they touch on general themes, they do not specifically address the juxtaposition of prayer/luck and physical work.

Therefore, the lesson is that one must take action to save oneself rather than relying solely on others or the divine.

1.  **The Conflict:** The Frog and the Mouse are so consumed by their rivalry and their specific battle for ""sovereignty"" that they neglect their surroundings.
2.  **The Turning Point:** While they are locked in combat, they become easy targets for a third party (the Kite).
3.  **The Result:** Neither party wins the ""prize"" (the marsh); instead, both are lost to an outsider who benefits from their distraction.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) When fools fight others run away with the prize.** This is the classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable. The ""fools"" (the Frog and Mouse) are so busy fighting that the ""prize"" (or the combatants themselves) is taken by a third party.
*   **B) People who do harm to others destroy themselves in the bargain.** While they are destroyed, the focus is more on the distraction of the fight than the intent to harm.
*   **C, D, E)** These touch on themes of vigilance and danger, but ""A"" is the traditional and most precise summary of the dynamic where a third party benefits from the exhaustion or distraction of two rivals.

In many classic editions of Aesop's Fables, this story (The Frog and the Mouse) is used specifically to illustrate that when two parties fight over something, a third party often steps in and takes everything.

The surviving daughter wondered to see strangers so much concerned at the loss of her sister, and he",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** A family has lost a daughter. Mourning is taking place, but the daughter observes a discrepancy between the behavior of the family and the behavior of the hired strangers.
2.  **The Observation:** The surviving daughter notices that the strangers (the professional mourners) appear much more devastated and vocal in their grief than the actual family members.
3.  **The Resolution:** The mother explains the reason for this behavior: the family gains nothing by performing outward displays of grief, whereas the strangers are specifically paid to perform that role.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the transactional nature of certain displays of emotion. The ""mourning"" of the strangers is not heartfelt; it is a service rendered for a fee. This is a classic Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Mother and her Two Daughters"" or ""The Hireling Mourner"") which serves as a commentary on the fact that outward displays of emotion can be purchased and do not necessarily reflect genuine feeling.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Professional mourners serve those who pay the most:** This aligns directly with the mother's explanation that the strangers ""have money for it."" It highlights the commercial nature of their grief.
*   **B, C, D, E:** These options either focus on unrelated themes (virtue, curiosity, shared sorrow) or misinterpret the cynical pragmatism of the mother's response.

3.  **The Explanation**: When asked why she is in the wilderness, Truth explains that in the past, lies were rare (""found among only a few""). However, in the present age, lies have ""spread throughout all of human society.""
4.  **The Implication**: Truth can no longer exist or be found within human society because falsehood and deceit have become universal or omnipresent among people.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Falsehood is with all men:** This directly reflects Truth's statement that lies have spread through ""all of human society."" It captures the cynical observation that honesty has been displaced by universal deception.
*   **B) He who claims any good for himself...**: This pertains to vanity or religious gratitude, which is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C) Curiosity uncovers hidden truths:** While the man is curious, the focus of the story is the state of the world, not the act of discovery.
*   **D) Even beneficial things all appear to be drastic...**: This is a complex moral unrelated to the simple dialogue regarding the prevalence of lies.
*   **E) Compassion can be a guiding light...**: The man shows concern, but the story's climax is Truth's indictment of humanity, not the man's compassion.

The story serves as a commentary on the corruption of society and the rarity of honesty.

As the ox stru",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Context:** The donkey and the ox are paired together to share a single workload.
2.  **The Conflict:** The ox is struggling and injured, while the donkey refuses to contribute his fair share of the labor.
3.  **The Consequence (Phase 1):** Because the donkey did not help, the ox was overworked and died.
4.  **The Consequence (Phase 2):** Because the ox died, the donkey was forced to carry the entire original load *plus* the weight of the ox’s body. This resulted in the donkey's own death.
5.  **The Moral Reflection:** The birds point out that by being ""kind enough to help,"" the donkey would have avoided his own demise.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This matches the narrative perfectly. By refusing to help his partner (the neighbor), the donkey ended up inheriting the partner's entire burden, leading to his ruin.
*   **B:** While the ending was bad, the story specifically focuses on the lack of cooperation and mutual aid rather than just the general unpredictability of outcomes.
*   **C:** Hard work did not triumph; the hard-working ox died.
*   **D:** This is vague and doesn't capture the relational aspect of the failure to help.
*   **E:** While the donkey avoided effort, the specific lesson emphasizes the shared nature of the burden and the consequences of being unhelpful to a peer.

The story illustrates that mutual aid is not just a gesture of kindness, but a matter of self-preservation.

1.  **The Context:** The story explains how Modesty was added to the human composition. Because Man was created in a hurry, Modesty was an afterthought and had to be introduced to humanity as a whole rather than integrated individually during creation.
2.  **The Conflict/Condition:** Modesty initially feels slighted, but agrees to join the human experience under one specific condition.
3.  **The Climax/Resolution:** Modesty explicitly states her condition: ""that carnal love might not be suffered to come into the same company; for wherever that comes, says she, I'm gone.""

**Analysis of the Options:**
- **A) Modesty and carnal love cannot survive together:** This directly mirrors the final sentence of the fable, where Modesty declares that if carnal love appears, she must depart.
- **B) We must not require what is unreasonable:** While a general moral, it is not the focus of this specific character interaction.
- **C) Haste can lead to unwelcome outcomes:** While the story mentions Jupiter was in a hurry, the focus of the fable is the nature of Modesty, not the errors of Jupiter's haste.
- **D) Do not unmodestly mock...:** This is the moral for a different fable (often associated with Aesop's ""The Old Man and Death"" or similar tales).
- **E) Virtues shared are virtues gained:** This does not reflect the exclusive nature of the relationship between Modesty and Love described in the text.

The core lesson of the fable is that modesty and carnal desire are mutually exclusive; when one enters, the other disappears.

The fox then said to ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A monkey and a fox are traveling and pass a cemetery. The monkey makes a grandiose claim, stating that the dead people buried there were once the slaves/freedmen of his ancestors, implying he comes from a noble or powerful lineage.
2.  **The Reality:** The monkey identifies a specific location (a cemetery) where the subjects of his claim are dead and buried. Because they are dead, they cannot speak, verify, or deny his claim.
3.  **The Fox’s Observation:** The fox points out the convenience of the monkey's lie. He notes that the monkey specifically chose a situation where no one can ""rise up and refute"" the claim.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights how braggarts or liars often choose to tell tall tales in situations where they cannot be fact-checked or contradicted by witnesses.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Deceivers often exploit the inability of others to challenge their falsehoods.** This directly reflects the fox’s point: the monkey is lying because the dead cannot talk back.
*   **B)** Irrelevant; there is no mention of old or new friends.
*   **C)** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific nuance of using the *absence* of witnesses (the cemetery setting).
*   **D)** The monkey isn't in ""deep water"" (trouble) yet; the fox is simply calling out his tactic.
*   **E)** Too vague; the focus is on the lie told at the cemetery.

The most accurate moral is that people who like to boast or lie often do so when they know no one can prove them wrong.

1.  **The Action:** A Farmer shows compassion and kindness to a Snake that is dying from the cold. He goes beyond simple help by placing it in his bosom (close to his heart/body) to warm it.
2.  **The Reaction:** Once the Snake is revived and healthy again, it does not show gratitude. Instead, it follows its ""natural instincts"" and bites the person who saved its life.
3.  **The Result:** The Farmer dies, realizing too late that his kindness could not change the inherent nature of a ""scoundrel.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches that some beings (or people) have a nature that remains unchanged regardless of how much kindness or mercy is shown to them. Malice and ingratitude can override even the greatest acts of benevolence.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the theme that kindness cannot change or bind someone who is fundamentally ungrateful or malicious.
*   **B:** This is the opposite of what happened; the Farmer was rewarded with death, not gratitude.
*   **C:** Gratitude did not exist in this story, and the Farmer died with regret.
*   **D:** While it mentions ingratitude, the story is more about the danger of misplaced kindness than the act of forgiving injuries.
*   **E:** This is a literal interpretation of the story's start but misses the central warning regarding the outcome.

The traditional moral associated with Aesop's ""The Farmer and the Viper"" is that kindness to the ill-disposed is ill-placed and will not change their nature.

1.  **The Situation:** The blacksmiths are engaged in loud, heavy labor (clanging hammers), which would typically be disruptive. However, the dog sleeps through this because it does not result in a personal reward for him.
2.  **The Contrast:** As soon as the sound of eating occurs (a much quieter sound), the dog wakes up. This sound signals a potential benefit (food).
3.  **The Lesson:** The dog is indifferent to the hard work or the needs of the masters, but highly sensitive to moments of self-interest. This illustrates that people (or animals) often ignore important matters that don't affect them personally, while remaining hyper-vigilant regarding their own gains.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the story—the dog ignores the hammers (not his concern) but hears the chewing (his benefit).
*   **B)** This is more about delegation of tasks, which doesn't apply here.
*   **C)** While the blacksmiths are diligent and the dog is opportunistic, the fable focuses more on the dog's selective perception rather than a competition between the two.
*   **D)** This relates to the fable of ""The Wolf and the Lamb,"" not this story.
*   **E)** This is a modern interpretation of sensory adaptation, but fables traditionally focus on character flaws like laziness or greed.

The traditional moral of this Aesop's fable is that those who sleep through labor but wake for the feast are only interested in what benefits them.

1.  **The Action:** The lion (the enemy) feigns weakness and sickness to trick the unicorn (his rival) into giving up his only weapon/defense (his horn). 
2.  **The Result:** Once the unicorn is defenseless, the lion attacks him. The unicorn’s kindness and pity led to his downfall because he trusted a known enemy.
3.  **The Lion’s Philosophy:** The lion argues that mercy toward an enemy is a mistake and that one must neutralize an enemy by any means to ensure one's own survival.
4.  **The Unicorn’s Final Words:** While the unicorn argues for honor, his situation serves as a grim warning: he is ""laid low"" because he believed the lies of a predator.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **B and D** are irrelevant to the core themes of the text.
*   **E** is the unicorn's perspective, but the story serves more as a cautionary tale about the consequences of the unicorn's actions rather than a celebration of his honor.
*   **C** is a general truth, but **A** specifically addresses the dynamic between ""enemies"" and the danger of ""supplicating"" behavior, which is the exact scenario described (the lion pretending to be old, sick, and humble).

The story teaches that one should never lower their guard or surrender their means of defense to an enemy, regardless of how pitiable that enemy appears to be.

But being the ruler of the freshwater wasn't enough for him; he wanted to rule the sea too. With t",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** The Pike is already the ""Prince of the River,"" possessing size, beauty, and strength. He has a secure and prestigious position in his own domain.
2.  **The Conflict:** He becomes ""ambitious"" and decides that ruling the freshwater isn't enough. He seeks to expand his rule to the sea, a domain for which he is not suited and where he is not the strongest.
3.  **The Consequence:** He is immediately humbled and nearly killed by a Dolphin, a creature naturally suited to that larger domain.
4.  **The Resolution:** He returns to his stream and stays there, having learned that his original lot was where he truly belonged.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Be content with your lot:** This fits perfectly. The Pike was a ""Prince"" but wanted more; his failure taught him to stay within his own territory and be satisfied with his natural position.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you...** The story focuses on the Pike's ambition and power dynamics, not social reputation.
*   **C) Strength without humility invites downfall:** While true, the Pike didn't necessarily fall due to a lack of humility, but due to overstepping his natural boundaries/territory.
*   **D) Ambitious counsel without mighty help is useless:** This is a classic Aesop moral (often associated with ""The Pelic and the Partridge""), but the Pike acted on his own ambition, not on ""counsel"" (advice) from others.
*   **E) True leadership is not just about appearance...** The story is about the limits of power and territory, not the quality of his leadership style.

The core lesson is that the Pike should have been satisfied with his dominion over the river rather than risking everything to take over a realm (the sea) where he did not belong.

As soon as the ro,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Event:** Two soldiers are attacked. One flees (cowardice) while the other fights (bravery).
2.  **The Aftermath:** Once the danger is over, the one who fled returns and boasts about how he would have handled the situation, making a show of drawing his sword and shouting threats.
3.  **The Response:** The soldier who actually fought points out the discrepancy between the companion's bold words and his previous actions. He notes that the companion's display is useless because he has already proven himself unreliable in a moment of real danger.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) Courage in words means nothing if you flee in danger:** This directly addresses the contrast between the soldier's boasting after the fact and his retreat during the fight.
*   **B) There is little risk in being poor...:** This is irrelevant to the plot of the story.
*   **C) Bravery outshines cowardice:** While true, it is a general statement that doesn't capture the specific irony of the ""boasting coward"" which is the heart of this fable.
*   **D) Know your aggressive, unreliable enemies:** The coward is a companion/comrade, not the primary ""enemy"" (the robber).
*   **E) Courage in adversity reveals true character:** This is a strong candidate, but fables of this type (traditionally attributed to Aesop or Phaedrus) specifically target the ""braggart"" who uses words to cover for a lack of deeds.

The core lesson is that brave words mean nothing when a person has already shown they lack the courage to back them up when it matters. Option A most accurately captures the rebuke given by the fighting soldier.

1.  **The Situation**: The Eagle (a kingly figure) honors the Hoopoe by giving it a seat of honor above all other birds.
2.  **The Evidence for Honor**: The Hoopoe is chosen for its ""crown"" and ""multicolored feathers""—purely external, aesthetic qualities.
3.  **The Reality of the Character**: Despite looking regal, the Hoopoe is ""accustomed to spend all its time rolling around in dung and filth."" This highlights a disconnect between the bird's beautiful exterior and its dirty, ignoble habits.
4.  **The Reaction**: The other birds resent this because they recognize that the honor is unearned based on the Hoopoe's true nature and lifestyle.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A**: This directly addresses the contrast between the Hoopoe’s ""multicolored feathers"" (outward appearance) and its ""filth"" (character/deeds). It suggests that the Eagle made a mistake by judging based on looks.
*   **B**: This is the moral of the fable ""The Eagle and the Beetle,"" but it does not fit this specific story.
*   **C**: While resentment is mentioned, the story focuses more on *why* the resentment exists (the injustice of the choice) rather than the effect of resentment on the party.
*   **D**: This is the moral of ""The Lion and the Mouse"" and is not applicable here.
*   **E**: The story actually highlights a failure of judgment in leadership rather than a lesson on inclusivity.

The story teaches that someone may look ""regal"" or ""notable"" on the outside, but if their habits and character are ""filthy,"" they do not truly deserve seats of honor.

They w",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A hen (a creature typically associated with nurturing and domesticity) finds snake eggs. Instead of avoiding them, she treats them as her own, brooding on them to hatch them.
2.  **The Nature of the Subject:** Snakes are natural predators and inherently dangerous to hens and their surroundings.
3.  **The Warning:** A swallow observes this and points out the hen's ""senseless"" behavior. The swallow warns that by nurturing something inherently dangerous or wicked, the hen is ensuring her own destruction and the destruction of others.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates that kindness or devotion toward the ""wicked"" or naturally predatory does not change their nature; it only empowers them to cause harm. Helping a villain or a threat grow strong is a self-destructive act.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A:** Matches the lesson. The ""wicked man"" (represented by the snake) is dangerous regardless of how ""innocuous"" he appears as an egg.
*   **B:** Relates to greed (The Dog and His Reflection), which is not present here.
*   **C:** The story suggests the opposite; devotion invited danger.
*   **D:** This relates to pride or competition (The Frog and the Ox), not nurturing.
*   **E:** This is a literal interpretation of the hen's act, but the fable uses the swallow's warning to condemn the act as folly rather than celebrate it as a virtue.

In Aesop's fables, this specific story (The Hen and the Swallow) is traditionally used to warn that an evil nature cannot be changed by kindness and that those who help the wicked are their first victims.

1.  **The Situation:** The jackdaw is captured and kept as a pet (a ""slave in human society""). While it lacks freedom, it is alive and safe.
2.  **The Action:** Desiring freedom above all else, the bird escapes.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because it is still dragging the string from its captivity, it gets tangled in its own home and dies. 
4.  **The Reflection:** The bird realizes that its restlessness and inability to endure its previous condition led to a much worse fate (death).

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **B, C, and D** are irrelevant to the specific themes of the story (tears, generosity, or betrayal by the innocent).
*   **E** focuses on the man's perspective (the ""gift"" to the children), but the story concludes with the bird's internal realization about its own state of mind and choices.
*   **A** highlights that it is the bird's ""mind"" (its inability to reconcile with its condition and its impulsive need to flee) that led to its destruction. This is a classic interpretation of Aesop's fables regarding contentment versus dangerous ambition/restlessness. The bird's unhappiness was driven by its perception of its condition, leading to a choice that resulted in its death.

The fable illustrates that seeking to escape a non-ideal condition without caution can lead to a fatal one, and that our own dissatisfaction often drives our downfall.

'Be careful, my friends,' he said, 'what if we all drown before the me",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of sailors is in a life-threatening storm.
2.  **The Conflict/Problem:** The sailors are praying to various intermediaries (saints) to relay their messages for help.
3.  **The Observation:** One sailor points out a practical flaw: the process of using messengers (saints) takes time and introduces a risk that they might drown before the help arrives.
4.  **The Solution:** He suggests bypassing the intermediaries and going ""directly to the one who can save us without any help"" (God).
5.  **The Outcome:** By eliminating the middleman and taking the more direct route, their prayers are heard and the storm ceases.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) The shortest and surest way of doing things is best:** This aligns perfectly with the sailor's logic. He advocates for the most direct path to the source of power to ensure efficiency and success in a crisis.
*   **B) It is better to be loved than feared:** This is a Machiavellian theme not present in the text.
*   **C) Mercy tempers power:** While God shows mercy, the focus of the sailor's advice is on the *method* of reaching that power.
*   **D) Not all pragmatic advice is diverse or wise:** The advice given *was* wise and pragmatic, so this contradicts the story.
*   **E) Urgency in communication is vital:** While communication was urgent, the story specifically highlights the *path* or *method* of communication (direct vs. indirect) rather than just the speed.

The fable teaches that when a task is urgent or important, it is best to go straight to the source rather than relying on intermediaries. This is a classic Aesopic moral often phrased as: ""The shortest and surest way of doing things is best.""

The mice who lived in the house were always being hunted down by either the snake or the weasel, so when they saw the snake and the ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Context:** Two predators (the snake and the weasel) are in conflict. These predators both prey on the same third party (the mice).
2.  **The Mistake:** The mice misinterpret the conflict between their enemies as a sign of safety or an opportunity to emerge from hiding. They assume that because their enemies are distracted by each other, the mice are no longer in danger.
3.  **The Result:** The common enemies (the snake and the weasel) quickly realize there is an easier, shared opportunity (the mice) and unite or pivot to hunt the mice instead.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A:** This fits well. The mice (bystanders/weaker parties) celebrate the conflict of the powerful, but their presence draws the aggression toward them, leading to their demise.
*   **B:** While true in a general sense, the story is more specific about the danger of miscalculating safety during a conflict.
*   **C:** The mice were not ""outwitting"" the predators; they were caught.
*   **D:** This is a common interpretation of this specific Aesop's fable (*The Snake and the Weasel*). It warns that those who interject themselves into the quarrels of others—or assume a conflict between enemies makes them safe—often find themselves the new target. It emphasizes that one is never truly safe just because their enemies are occupied.
*   **E:** While the house is the setting, the lesson is about the behavior of the inhabitants, not the ""peace of the home"" itself.

Between A and D, **A** is a modern pedagogical summary, but **D** captures the specific irony intended by the fable: that people who rejoice in the disputes of their enemies often end up as the victims once those enemies find a common target or resolve their issue. However, in most standardized assessments of this specific fable text, the lesson is that **those who meddle in others' feuds or assume security during a ""war"" among others are the ones who get hurt.**

The most accurate moral regarding the mice's specific error—thinking they were safe because of a fight—is that bystanders are often the most at risk when the ""powerful"" stop fighting each other to turn on the ""weak.""

2.  **The Master’s Argument:** Life in the cage is objectively easier and more comfortable (""you'll never be as well cared for anywhere else"").
3.  **The Bird’s Rebuttal:** The bird acknowledges that life outside might be harder or less comfortable, but prefers personal agency and independence over provided comforts (""I would rather take care of myself than be under your care"").
4.  **The Underlying Theme:** The story contrasts **security/comfort** with **liberty/independence**. The bird values its freedom more than the ""wealth"" of being provided for.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) There is no wealth greater than liberty.** This matches the bird's sentiment perfectly. Even though the boy offers the ""wealth"" of care, the bird chooses liberty as the superior state.
*   **B) You should not treat bad people the same way...** This is irrelevant; the story isn't about the boy's character, but about the bird's autonomy.
*   **C) Defiance can mask true concern.** This focuses on the boy's feelings, while the fable focuses on the bird's choice.
*   **D) Changing your independent location...** This is a misunderstanding of a different Aesop-style moral (often associated with ""The Caged Bird and the Bat"").
*   **E) Freedom is a treasure worth pursuing, even at great risk.** While close, the story doesn't explicitly focus on the ""risk"" or ""pursuit"" as much as it focuses on the **value** of being one's own master versus being a well-kept servant. ""A"" is the classic phrasing for this specific fable.

The central lesson is that independence and self-reliance are more valuable than the material comforts provided by a master.

morables_638,"A donkey was complaining that he lacked horns, while a monkey was complaining that she lacked a tail. The mole said to them, 'Silence your complaining, since you can see that I am deprived of eyes.'",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions between the characters:

1.  **The Characters' Grievances:** The donkey and the monkey are focused on minor physical aesthetic or functional ""deficiencies"" (horns and a tail). These represent relative misfortunes or desires for things they never had to begin with.
2.  **The Mole's Intervention:** The mole interrupts them to point out a much more significant deprivation: the lack of sight.
3.  **The Lesson:** The mole's statement serves to put the complaints of the donkey and the monkey into perspective. By comparing their minor complaints to the mole's total lack of vision, the story suggests that people often complain about small things until they realize others are facing much harder struggles.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** Directly aligns with the story's theme. Observing the greater misfortunes of others (the mole) helps one bear their own minor inconveniences (no horns/no tail) more patiently.
*   **B:** Relates to mutual aid/cooperation, which is not the focus here.
*   **C:** While true that complaining doesn't restore things, the story specifically highlights the *comparison* between different levels of misfortune.
*   **D:** This suggests a karmic retribution (""what goes around comes around""), which does not happen in this story.
*   **E:** This focuses on ""unique gifts,"" but the story is focused on deprivation and misfortune rather than hidden talents.

The moral is that our own troubles seem smaller, and thus easier to bear, when we realize that others have it much worse.

The soup fell out of the long bill of the Cra",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The Fox plays a trick on the Crane by serving food in a flat dish. The Fox knows the Crane's long beak makes it impossible for him to eat, essentially mocking his guest.
2.  **The Crane's Reaction:** Instead of simply being angry, the Crane retaliates by inviting the Fox to a meal served in a long-necked flagon. This makes it impossible for the Fox to eat, while the Crane eats easily.
3.  **The Conclusion:** The story ends by saying the Fox met with a ""fitting requital"" (repayment in kind) based on how she treated the Crane.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This is the ""Golden Rule."" Since the Fox treated the Crane poorly, the Crane treated the Fox poorly in return. The story illustrates that if you do something unkind to others, you should expect it to be done back to you.
*   **B:** While the Fox used tricks, the story focuses more on the *reciprocity* of the behavior rather than just warning against tricksters.
*   **C:** This describes what happened, but it isn't a ""moral"" (a lesson on how to behave).
*   **D:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E:** While true in a general sense, the story focuses on the ""eye for an eye"" aspect of the Crane's revenge.

The fable is a classic illustration of the principle that treat others the way you want to be treated, or you will suffer the same treatment you inflicted on them. This aligns most closely with Option A.

1.  **The Situation:** A woman is disliked by everyone in her husband's household. The husband wants to see if this behavior is universal or situational.
2.  **The Test:** He sends her to her father's house. 
3.  **The Result:** She complains that even the shepherds and herdsmen (who are outdoors working from dawn until dusk and thus barely saw her) looked at her with ""aversion.""
4.  **The Logic:** The husband concludes that if people who only saw her for a few moments at the start and end of the day disliked her, those who spent the entire day with her must have found her intolerable.
5.  **The Lesson:** Small indicators (the reaction of the shepherds) reveal a much larger truth (her overall character and the extent of her unpopularity). 

Evaluating the options:
- **A) Straws show how the wind blows.** This is an idiom meaning that small signs reveal the general direction of a situation or character. The shepherds' brief looks of aversion were the ""straws"" indicating the ""wind"" of her generally unpleasant personality.
- **B, C, D, E:** These do not fit the logical deduction made by the husband regarding small signs indicating a larger problem.

The moral traditionally associated with this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Unamiable Wife"" or ""The Man and His Wife"") is that small signs point to larger truths.

1.  **The Situation:** There is a coach with four wheels. One of them is creaking (complaining/making noise).
2.  **The Observation:** The coachman notices that the wheel making the most noise is the ""worst wheel of the whole set.""
3.  **The Lesson:** This fable (often attributed to Aesop or found in various moral collections) highlights that it is often the least capable, most flawed, or weakest members of a group who complain the loudest or make the most fuss. In traditional interpretations of this fable (""The Creaking Wheel""), it is noted that those who do the least work or are in the worst condition are the ones who complain most.

Looking at the options:
- **A) Complaining is the privilege of the weak:** This aligns with the observation that the ""worst"" wheel is the one making the noise. It implies that those who are less effective often voice the most grievances.
- **B, C, D, E:** These do not directly relate to the specific irony of the ""worst"" wheel being the only one that ""takes the liberty"" to creak.

In many classic editions of this fable, the moral is phrased as: ""Those who do the least work often make the most noise"" or ""The weakest wheel creaks the most,"" which is encapsulated by the idea that complaining is a behavior associated with the ""worst"" or weakest parts.

morables_612,"There was a woman of Sybaris who broke a jar. The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, 'I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you'd gone right",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the components of the fable:

1.  **The Event**: A woman breaks a jar (a practical problem).
2.  **The Response of the ""Jar""**: Instead of addressing the physical damage, it seeks a legal witness to build a case against the woman (focusing on litigation and argument).
3.  **The Woman's Rebuttal**: She points out that the ""jar"" is being foolish. If it wants to be fixed or maintained, it needs a ""bandage"" (a practical repair) rather than a courtroom victory.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
*   The story contrasts two ways of handling a problem: the legal/argumentative route (getting a witness) and the practical/corrective route (getting a bandage).
*   The woman's statement highlights that the desire to win a dispute or assign blame is less useful than the desire to fix what is broken.
*   **A) Action is more valuable than arguments** directly reflects this lesson. It suggests that doing something to remedy a situation is better than talking or arguing about who is right.
*   B, C, D, and E do not accurately reflect the specific contrast between the ""court-case"" and the ""bandage."" While the woman is being sarcastic, the lesson isn't that practicality ""triumphs over sarcasm"" (C), but rather that practical action (the bandage) is what was actually needed instead of the legal posturing.

The fable teaches that when something goes wrong, one should focus on fixing the damage rather than engaging in useless litigation or verbal disputes.

When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** Two powerful, majestic sea creatures (Dolphins and Whales) are engaged in a serious and destructive conflict.
2.  **The Intervention:** A Sprat (a very small, insignificant fish) offers to act as an umpire or mediator to settle the dispute.
3.  **The Reaction:** The Dolphins reject the offer immediately. Their reasoning is not that they love war, but that they find the idea of an insignificant creature interfering in their ""high-level"" affairs more offensive than the prospect of mutual destruction.
4.  **The Core Theme:** The story highlights the pride and arrogance of the powerful. They value their status and the ""dignity"" of their conflict so much that they despise help from those they deem inferior.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** While they are fighting, the story focuses more on *who* they refuse peace from rather than a general desire to fight.
*   **B:** There is no mention of adaptation.
*   **C:** This is the most accurate. The Dolphins' pride makes them prefer ruin over accepting help from a lowly source.
*   **D:** This is a fragment of a thought, not a moral about the specific interaction with the Sprat.
*   **E:** While mutual ruin is a possible outcome, the ""lesson"" is specifically about the rejection of the mediator based on his low status.

In many classical collections of Aesop's Fables, the moral associated with this story is that ""there are some unimportant men who, in a time of public upheaval, think they are important, but they are held in contempt by those who are truly involved."" However, within the context of the provided options, the story serves as a warning that pride and the fear of ""losing face"" to an inferior can lead people to continue destructive conflicts.

One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them. When th",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation:** A Man and a Satyr form an alliance (a bond of friendship/trust).
2.  **The Observation:** The Satyr observes the Man performing the same action (blowing breath from his mouth) for two diametrically opposed purposes: once to warm his hands and once to cool his food.
3.  **The Satyr's Reaction:** The Satyr becomes suspicious and disgusted. He decides he can no longer be friends with someone whose ""same breath"" can produce opposite effects.
4.  **The Literal vs. Figurative Meaning:** Literally, the story is about thermal physics. Figuratively, ""blowing hot and cold"" is a classic idiom describing a person who is inconsistent, indecisive, or hypocritical—specifically, someone who changes their story or their loyalty depending on the situation. 

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the figurative meaning of the Satyr’s complaint. In Fables (specifically Aesop's), the Satyr views the Man's inconsistency as a sign of duplicity or unreliability. A person who can argue for both sides or change their nature so easily is seen as untrustworthy.
*   **B:** Irrelevant to the story's events.
*   **C:** While the man is technically being adaptable, the story presents this as a negative trait (inconsistency) rather than a positive one.
*   **D:** This is overly complex and does not reflect the ""hot and cold"" metaphor.
*   **E:** This is a plausible moral for many fables, but it doesn't capture the specific ""duplicity"" of the ""hot and cold"" metaphor which is central to this specific story.

The traditional moral of this Aesop's Fable is that we should avoid the friendship of those who are inconsistent or who can use the same means to achieve opposite ends, as they are deemed double-faced.

1.  **The Context:** Socrates builds a small house. A neighbor questions why a man of his stature would have such a ""tiny little"" dwelling.
2.  **The Response:** Socrates replies, ""if only I could fill it with true friends!""
3.  **The Meaning:** By saying he wishes he could fill even a tiny house with true friends, Socrates is implying that ""true friends"" are so rare that even a very small space is more than enough to accommodate all the ones a person is likely to find in a lifetime. 

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) True friends are hard to find:** This aligns perfectly with Socrates' implication that a small house is still too large for the number of genuine friends one actually possesses.
*   **B) No curse weighs more heavily than a guilty conscience:** This is unrelated to the story.
*   **C) Curiosity fuels wisdom:** While the neighbor is curious, the point of the story is the answer, not the act of asking.
*   **D) Do not play the modest, philosophical wise man after the fact:** This is a criticism of the narrator or the behavior, but not the moral lesson regarding the dialogue itself.
*   **E) True greatness often requires enduring present hardships for future recognition:** While the narrator mentions dying like Socrates for fame, this is an introductory sentiment by the narrator, not the moral of the fable's central anecdote about the house.

The core of the fable (which is derived from Phaedrus's *Fables*) is the scarcity of genuine friendship.

Admittedly, Prometheus had made the lion very large and handsome, supplying him with sharp fangs in his jaw and arming him w",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the story's lesson:

1.  **The Lion's Problem:** Despite being the most powerful and majestic of animals, the lion is obsessed with a single perceived flaw: his irrational fear of roosters. He is so ashamed of this weakness that he considers his life not worth living.
2.  **The Encounter:** The lion meets the elephant, another massive and powerful creature, and notices the elephant is constantly flapping his ears in a state of agitation.
3.  **The Realization:** The lion learns that the mighty elephant lives in fear of a tiny gnat entering his ear.
4.  **The Shift in Perspective:** Comparing his situation to the elephant's, the lion realizes that if even the elephant has a ""small"" fear, his own fear of roosters is not unique or shameful. He finds comfort in the fact that others—even those who seem superior or equal—have their own burdens or vulnerabilities.
5.  **The Moral:** The story illustrates that we often magnify our own flaws or misfortunes until we see that others have troubles of their own, often worse or more embarrassing than ours. By seeing the elephant's plight, the lion feels ""much better shape"" and regains his self-worth.

The goddess clearly hates you so much that she has taken",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interaction between the crow and the dog:

1.  **The Context:** In Greek mythology/folklore, the crow was once a messenger bird for the gods but lost favor (specifically with Athena) and became associated with bad omens or lost its ""credibility.""
2.  **The Conflict:** The dog points out the futility of the crow's actions. He argues that because Athena has already rejected the crow (devaluing its omens), the crow is wasting resources by sacrificing to her.
3.  **The Crow's Logic:** The crow explains that its devotion is calculated. Because it is currently in a position of disfavor, it treats its ""enemy"" (the goddess who hates it) with high honors specifically to bribe or persuade her to change her mind.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates a cynical but pragmatic behavior: people often bestow gifts or kindness upon those who dislike them (enemies or hostile authorities) not out of genuine love, but as a strategic move to secure a favor or improve their standing.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly reflects the crow's strategy of treating a hostile party well to gain a benefit.
*   **B** is irrelevant to the text.
*   **C** is too poetic; the crow's motive is transactional, not purely ""spiritual hope.""
*   **D** contradicts the story, as the crow is attempting something *despite* lacking the immediate means (credibility).
*   **E** ignores the fact that Athena is not becoming a ""friend,"" but a target of a bribe.

The story goes that when a male hyena was treating a female badly, she said to him",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"In this fable, often attributed to Aesop, the core interaction involves a power dynamic that is destined to shift. The female hyena warns the male that because their roles (sexes) alternate, the one currently in power (the male) should not mistreat the subordinate (the female), as the subordinate will soon occupy the position of the superior.

The story serves as a warning to those in authority or a position of strength: do not abuse your power over others, because the ""tables may turn,"" and those you mistreat today may be your masters or judges tomorrow.

Looking at the options:
- **A** captures this idea of shifting roles and the reversal of power/judgment.

- **C** and **E** focus on internal character or growth, which misses the external warning of the hyena's threat.
- **D** focuses on mistrust, whereas the fable specifically focuses on the consequences of mistreatment in a hierarchy.

In the classical interpretation of this fable (Aesop's Fables), the moral is often translated as: ""This is a story for a person who is in office: let him perform his duties in such a way that he does not forget that he will soon be a private citizen again,"" or more broadly, that those being judged now may become the judges later.

The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Agreement:** The lion (King of Land) and the dolphin (King of Sea) form an alliance based on their status and roles as rulers. They assume their shared positions make them perfect partners.
2.  **The Conflict:** The lion enters a battle on land (against a bull) and calls upon his ally for assistance.
3.  **The Limitation:** Despite the dolphin's willingness and ""regal"" status, he is physically incapable of assisting the lion because his nature restricts him to the water.
4.  **The Resolution:** The lion feels betrayed, but the dolphin explains that the failure isn't due to a lack of loyalty, but a lack of physical capability.

**Lessons learned:**
The story teaches that status and titles are not enough when choosing a partner or ally. If you choose an ally whose nature or circumstances prevent them from actually helping you when you are in danger, the alliance is effectively useless in times of need. Therefore, when forming a friendship or alliance, one must consider whether the partner is actually capable of providing aid during moments of peril.

*   **Option A** directly addresses this: ""When we form friendships with one another, we must choose allies who can come to our aid in moments of peril."" 
*   **Option B** is incorrect because the dolphin did *not* have an inclination to betray; he was simply incapable.
*   **Option C and D** focus on ""regal/wild might"" but miss the core lesson about the practical limitations of alliances.
*   **Option E** is a plausible modern interpretation, but in the context of Aesop's Fables, the moral specifically focuses on the practical utility of a friend in times of crisis.

1.  **The Situation:** A fox attempts to deceive a cicada into coming down from a tree to eat him, using flattery and curiosity as a ruse.
2.  **The Cicada's Reaction:** The cicada does not fall for the trick. Instead, he tests the fox by dropping a leaf, confirming the fox's predatory intent when the fox pounces on it.
3.  **The Lesson Source:** The cicada explains *why* he was so cautious: he had seen the remains (wings) of another cicada in a fox's droppings (spoor) previously. 
4.  **The Conclusion:** Because the cicada observed what happened to others of his kind, he gained the wisdom necessary to avoid a similar fate. He learned from the ""misfortunes of his neighbors.""

Evaluating the options:

*   **B)** Irrelevant; no divine judgment is mentioned.
*   **C)** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific reason for the cicada's success (learning from others).
*   **D)** This describes a self-fulfilling prophecy (like the myth of Oedipus), which is the opposite of what happens here; the cicada successfully *avoids* his fate.
*   **E)** This is a partial truth, but the core of the fable is the cicada's foresight based on observation, not just the fox's exposure.

1.  **The Instructions:** The mother Goat warns her Kid to be cautious and only open the door for her, establishing a theme of vigilance against deception.
2.  **The Deception:** The Wolf attempts to deceive the Kid by ""counterfeiting"" (faking) the mother's voice. This makes the Wolf a **hypocrite** or an impostor—someone pretending to be what they are not to achieve a malicious end.
3.  **The Identification:** The Kid is not fooled by the auditory disguise because he uses further observation (looking out the window) to see the Wolf's true nature.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The Kid realizes that despite the imitated voice, the ""Wolf"" appearance remains. This illustrates that a deceptive person (a hypocrite) can be identified if one looks closely enough at the evidence.

*   **E)** This suggests the mother neglected oversight, but she actually provided very good instructions that saved the Kid.

In the classic collections of Aesop's Fables (such as Croxall's), this specific story of ""The Old Goat and her Kid"" is explicitly tied to the moral that ""Two checks are better than one"" or, most commonly in the context of the Wolf's deception, that a hypocrite/imposter can be detected.

Apollo immediately explained to the snake, 'If you had simply killed the first person who ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A snake is constantly being stepped on by people. This implies the snake is being treated as a doormat or a victim because it is perceived as harmless or passive.
2.  **The Dialogue:** Apollo tells the snake that if it had retaliated against the *first* person who stepped on it, others would have been too afraid to do so later. 
3.  **The Lesson:** The core message is about the importance of setting a precedent or a deterrent. By punishing the first transgression (an offense or a ""crime"" against the snake's well-being), the victim prevents a cycle of future mistreatment.
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A) If people who have previously committed a crime are swiftly punished, then others will become afraid on their account.** This aligns perfectly with Apollo's advice. Swift punishment of the first offender serves as a deterrent to others.
    *   **B)** The story isn't about wicked people acting in haste; it's about the snake's failure to act.
    *   **C)** Apollo is actually advocating for a more immediate (though perhaps instinctual) reaction, not critiquing it.
    *   **D)** The story focuses on force/retaliation as a deterrent, not necessarily ""cleverness.""
    *   **E)** The temple is the setting for the advice, but the moral focus is on the snake's passivity.

In Aesopic fables, particularly the version of ""The Snake and Apollo"" (found in collections like the Babrius or Aphthonius), the moral emphasizes that those who meet the first person who tries to wrong them with resistance will be feared by others. This is best captured by option A.

'I would agree,' the lion said, 'if you were not already in the habit of taking what",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the interactions between the characters:

1.  **The Lion and the Robber:** The robber demands a portion of the kill based on his habit of taking what he wants. The lion resists and refuses him because of the robber’s aggressive and entitled nature.
2.  **The Lion and the Wayfarer:** The wayfarer is modest and cautious, acknowledging the lion's power and staying back. Seeing this humility, the lion is moved to kindness, offering the man a share of the prize and even stepping away to make the man feel safe.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The robber (force) is resisted, while the wayfarer (humility) receives generosity. This is the central theme of Phaedrus's version of this fable.
*   **B:** While the robber is untrustworthy, the story is more about the lion's reaction to different behaviors rather than a betrayal.
*   **C:** The story isn't about the man taming the lion; it is about the lion choosing to reward a specific character trait.
*   **D:** The ""villain"" (the robber) does not outwit anyone; he is rebuffed.
*   **E:** While the robber is entitled, the story's resolution focuses on the contrast between him and the wayfarer.

The lesson is that aggressive entitlement is met with opposition, whereas humility and respect attract favor.

Since he was constantly paying out money and spending great sums on the offerings, the god came to him one night and said: 'L",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the narrative:

1.  **The Action:** A man is voluntarily spending all of his money on expensive religious sacrifices.
2.  **The Consequence:** This behavior leads to the depletion of his wealth.
3.  **The Intervention:** The deity (the hero) intervenes specifically to warn the man against his own behavior.
4.  **The Reason:** The god points out that when the man eventually becomes poor due to his own ""squandering,"" he will likely avoid taking responsibility and instead blame the god (or bad luck/spirit) for his misfortune.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A:** This matches the text perfectly. The god explicitly predicts that the man will blame the divine for a misfortune caused by his own foolish spending.
- **B:** There are no promises made in this story.
- **C:** While the man is being extravagant, the core of the story is about the delegation of blame for self-inflicted poverty.
- **D:** The man doesn't seem to be seeking profit; he is described as being devoted (though foolishly so).
- **E:** While a common theme in literature, the dialogue in this specific fable focuses on the shift of responsibility and blame rather than the quality of his devotion.

The story warns that people tend to blame external forces (God, fate, or shrines) for disasters that are actually the result of their own imprudent choices.

When he saw the reflection of his body in the water, he disparaged the slenderness of his legs but revelled in the shape and",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **Initial Assessment:** The stag looks at himself and makes a value judgment based on aesthetics. He dislikes his legs because they are ""slender"" (thin/unattractive) and loves his horns because of their ""shape and size"" (beauty/grandeur).
2.  **The Conflict:** When hunters arrive, the stag's physical attributes are put to a practical test. 
3.  **The Outcome:** His legs—the part of his body he ""disparaged""—actually save him by allowing him to outrun the hunters on the plain. His horns—the part he ""revelled"" in—ultimately cause his downfall by getting tangled in branches.
4.  **The Realization:** The stag’s final words emphasize that the things he considered worthless were actually his salvation, while his source of pride was his destruction.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** Matches the theme that the legs (underrated/undervalued) were the truly valuable asset.
*   **B:** While the stag was ""destroyed by the thing he boasted about,"" he wasn't necessarily ""greedy"" for his horns; he was vain. However, this option captures the tragic irony of the story well.
*   **C:** Persistence is not a primary theme; the story is about physical attributes and vanity.
*   **D:** There are no ""deceivers"" in this story; the stag is deceived only by his own judgment.
*   **E:** This is a strong candidate, but the fable emphasizes the utility of the legs over the stag's ""blindness.""

In the context of Aesop’s Fables (where this story originates), the standard moral emphasizes that we often despise what is useful and prize what is harmful. Option A most accurately reflects this reversal of value based on utility versus appearance.

Furious at ",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the dynamics between the characters:

1.  **The Conflict:** An Eagle (a powerful predator) shows complete disregard for a Beetle (a small, seemingly insignificant insect) by knocking it aside and killing the Hare it was protecting.
2.  **The Revenge:** Despite being physically smaller and weaker, the Beetle is persistent and clever. It finds a way to strike back at the Eagle by destroying its eggs, even when the Eagle seeks the protection of a god (Jupiter).
3.  **The Resolution:** Jupiter recognizes that the Beetle had a ""just cause."" The Eagle’s power did not protect it from the consequences of mistreating a smaller creature.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) The weak may find a way to avenge a wrong.** This directly reflects the Beetle's success in seeking justice against a much more powerful opponent.
*   **B) Greed for honor results in death.** This does not apply, as the story is about revenge and justice, not greed for honor.
*   **C) Power lies in restraint.** While the Eagle lacked restraint, the core of the story focuses on the consequences of that lack (the Beetle’s revenge). 
*   **D) Beauty and leadership.** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **E) Compassion bridges the divide.** The story shows a lack of compassion from the Eagle and a focused pursuit of revenge from the Beetle; they do not reconcile.

The story is a classic Aesop’s fable (""The Eagle and the Beetle"") illustrating that no one is so powerful that they can afford to insult or wrong even the smallest individual without consequence.

At a certain m",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"Here is the step-by-step thinking process for identifying the moral of the fable:

1.  **Analyze the Plot:** 
    *   **Phase 1:** An accident occurs (the donkey falls into the stream), and the salt dissolves. The donkey learns that ""falling in the water makes the load lighter.""
    *   **Phase 2:** The donkey tries to repeat this success on purpose. He is being ""cunning"" or ""tricky"" to avoid work.
    *   **Phase 3:** The merchant realizes he is being tricked. To counter this, he changes the cargo to sponges, which behave the opposite way (becoming heavier when wet).
    *   **Phase 4:** The donkey tries the trick a third time, but because the merchant has figured out his scheme, the donkey is punished with a much heavier load.

2.  **Identify the Conflict:** The conflict is between the donkey’s attempt to deceive his master and the master’s ability to observe and outsmart that deception.

3.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A) You can fool someone only so many times:** This fits perfectly. The donkey successfully fooled the merchant once (by accident) and a second time (on purpose), but by the third attempt, the merchant was wise to the trick and turned the tables.
    *   **B) Value is what others think...:** This is irrelevant to the story's themes of trickery and labor.
    *   **C) Cunning minds see wicked traps:** While the merchant used cunning to set a ""trap,"" the focus of the fable is usually on the failure of the trickster, not the inherent nature of traps.
    *   **D) Everyone should be satisfied...:** This is too convoluted and doesn't capture the specific ""trickster out-tricked"" dynamic.
    *   **E) Sometimes, accidents can lighten the load...:** This is a literal observation of the first part of the story, but it is not the *moral* (the lesson learned by the end).

4.  **Conclusion:** The fable (often attributed to Aesop) teaches that trickery is eventually discovered and can result in worse consequences for the person trying to cheat. ""A"" is the most accurate summary of this lesson.

Even after stroking the animal he was not sure of its i,0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Character:** The protagonist is a blind man with a heightened sense of touch, representing a person who relies on intuition and fundamental nature rather than superficial appearances.
2.  **The Action:** He is presented with a young animal (a cub). At this stage, the animal is small, perhaps cute, and has not yet committed any predatory acts.
3.  **The Recognition:** Although the man cannot definitively name the species (wolf or fox), he recognizes an inherent ""nature"" or ""disposition"" through touch. 
4.  **The Conclusion:** He identifies that the animal possesses a temperament that makes it inherently dangerous to a flock of sheep, regardless of its current size or youth.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The story suggests that even in a ""cub"" (early life), the dangerous or ""evil"" nature of the predator is detectable.
*   **B:** There is no mention of discipline or harsh means in the text.
*   **C:** While true in a general sense, the story is specifically about the innate nature of a predator being visible even in youth, which is more specific than just ""appearances.""
*   **D:** The story does not involve rewards or punishments.
*   **E:** While close, the core of Aesop's fable (which this is) focuses specifically on the ""nature"" of the creature manifesting early on, rather than the concept of the ""familiar.""

The moral traditionally attributed to this Aesop's fable is that a wicked nature is apparent even in the young, or that one can sense danger in a person's character before they have even acted upon it.

This man noticed that all sorts of people came to him, and he became curious to see who were true friend",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"The story describes a man who uses a ruse (a request for help in a dangerous fight) to distinguish between those who enjoy his hospitality (freeloaders) and those who are genuinely loyal (friends).

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1.  **The Context:** The Rich Man is generous, which attracts a crowd. However, he recognizes that many are there only for the food (""hangers-on"").
2.  **The Test:** He proposes a situation involving risk and sacrifice (a quarrel requiring swords). This shifts the dynamic from one of receiving a benefit to one of providing support.
3.  **The Result:** Out of a full table of guests, only two remained loyal when a sacrifice was required. The vast majority made excuses.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the scarcity of genuine loyalty. While many people will surround someone during times of prosperity and ease, very few will remain when things become difficult or dangerous.

- Option **A** focuses on the rarity of loyal people, which matches the outcome of the test (only two out of many were friends).
- Option **B** is irrelevant to the themes of friendship/loyalty.
- Option **C** is a possible takeaway regarding the man's behavior, but it isn't the primary ""moral"" regarding the human condition established by the ending.
- Option **D** is an observation about the hangers-on, but ""loyal beliefs"" isn't quite right; they never had loyalty to begin with.
- Option **E** is a strong contender, but the focus of the fable is more on the rarity and difficulty of finding those sincere people among the crowd.

Traditionally, this specific fable (often attributed to collections like those of Phaedrus or similar fabulists) is used to illustrate that prosperity gains friends, but adversity tries them, concluding that true friends are rare.

The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, 'Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch m",0.0,A,2,minimal,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable ""The Two Pots,"" let’s analyze the text step by step:

1.  **The Characters:** We have two pots—one made of earthenware (fragile) and one made of brass (strong/hard).
2.  **The Situation:** Both are being carried by the same river (a situation beyond their control).
3.  **The Conflict:** The Earthen Pot recognizes that if they collide, the Brass Pot will remain intact while it will be shattered. The difference in their composition makes a close relationship or proximity dangerous for the weaker party.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that power imbalances (represented by the materials) make companionship or proximity hazardous for the ""weaker"" individual. Throughout history, this Aesop's fable has been used to warn that the poor or weak should not associate too closely with the rich or powerful, as any ""clash"" or accident will only harm the vulnerable one.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) Equals make the best friends:** This directly reflects the lesson that associating with those who are vastly different in power or ""strength"" is dangerous. True safety and friendship are found among equals.
*   **B) Do not overestimate your worth:** The Earthen Pot is actually being very realistic, not overestimating its worth.
*   **C, E) Vital roles/Worth:** These are modern ""participation trophy"" interpretations that ignore the physical danger highlighted in the text.
*   **D) Cautious abstain:** While true in essence, it is not the traditional phrasing of this specific moral.

In classic collections of Aesop’s Fables (such as Townsend’s), the moral associated with ""The Two Pots"" is: **""Equals make the best friends""** (or ""The strong and the weak cannot keep company"").

1.  **The Action:** The wild boar is sharpening his tusks even though there is no immediate predator or danger in sight.
2.  **The Question:** The fox, representing a skeptical observer, questions the necessity of this work since there is no ""immediate need.""
3.  **The Reasoning:** The boar explains that if he waits until the danger is actually present, it will be too late to prepare. He must be ready *before* the threat arrives so that he can respond instantly.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story emphasizes the importance of foresight and preparation. It teaches that one should prepare for adversity during times of peace/safety.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace.** (This aligns with the theme of being ready for conflict ahead of time. In many translations of Aesop's fables, the moral of this specific story—""The Wild Boar and the Fox""—is summarized as ""Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace"" or ""Preparation for misfortune is the best preventive."")
*   **B) God is the ultimate judge.** (Irrelevant to the text.)
*   **C) Curiosity must be guided by prudence.** (The fox is curious, but the focus is on the boar's preparation, not the fox's inquiry.)
*   **D) Prudent men feel worst when they contribute to their own inquisitive undoing.** (Not applicable; no one is undone in this story.)
*   **E) Even nature prepares its own defenses.** (While true, it is less of a moral ""lesson"" for the reader than A.)

When the depositor then summoned him to swear an oath regarding the deposit, he realized the danger he was in and prepar",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the dialogue:

1.  **The Violation:** A man intends to steal a deposit from a friend and plans to swear a false oath to get away with it.
2.  **The Misunderstanding:** The man meets the god ""Oath,"" who tells him he usually returns to punish the wicked every thirty or forty years.
3.  **The Recklessness:** Based on this information, the man feels safe to commit perjury immediately, believing his punishment is decades away.
4.  **The Consequence:** The man is caught and punished by the god the very next day.
5.  **The Lesson:** The god explains that while he *can* take a long time to return, he can also return instantly if provoked.

**Analysis of Choices:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the god's final statement. The man expected a fixed schedule of punishment (30-40 years), but the god reveals that punishment is unpredictable and can happen at any time.
*   **B:** There is no ""crowd"" in this story, and it does not compare the goodness of individuals vs. groups.
*   **C:** While the man's fear led him to question the god, the story is more about the timing of divine justice than the psychological distortion of truth.
*   **D:** This pertains to inciting strife, which isn't the central theme of stealing a deposit and swearing a false oath.
*   **E:** While the story involves taking what isn't yours, the specific ""twist"" in the dialogue focuses on the *timing* of the punishment rather than the weight of a conscience.

The story serves as a warning that justice does not follow a predictable schedule; just because one thinks they have time to escape punishment doesn't mean it won't arrive immediately.

1.  **Initial Situation**: The farmer realizes his crops are ready, but instead of doing the work himself, he plans to rely on his neighbors. The mother Lark is unconcerned because she knows that when someone relies on others to do their work, the task is rarely urgent or guaranteed to happen.
2.  **Turning Point**: The farmer realizes the grain is falling from ripeness and decides he will hire laborers and **do the work himself**.
3.  **The Lesson**: The mother Lark recognizes that the harvest will finally happen because the farmer has taken personal responsibility for the task.

The story teaches that a task is only certain to be completed when one takes the initiative to do it themselves rather than waiting for the charity or assistance of others.

*   **A) Self-help is the best help:** This aligns perfectly with the farmer taking charge of his own harvest to ensure it gets done.
*   **B) Cunning often outwits itself:** There is no ""cunning"" or trickery in this story.
*   **C) Wisdom grows with determination:** While the mother is wise, the core of the story is about the necessity of personal action over external reliance.
*   **D) Do unto others...:** This is the Golden Rule, which is not the focus of this fable.
*   **E) Even the tiniest cradle...:** This is a poetic sentiment about the nest, but not the moral regarding the farmer's actions.

1.  **The Context:** Aesop is engaging in ""play"" (marbles) with children. A spectator mocks him, assuming that a wise or serious man should never engage in such trivialities.
2.  **The Metaphor:** Aesop uses an unstrung bow as a riddle. He explains that a bow kept under constant tension (""tightly strung at all times"") will eventually lose its strength or snap.
3.  **The Lesson:** The bow represents the human mind or spirit. The act of ""unstringing"" the bow represents relaxation, play, or rest. Just as a bow needs periods of rest to remain effective for work, a person needs periods of leisure or play to remain mentally sharp and productive.
4.  **Evaluating Options:**
    *   **A)** Aligns perfectly with the ""bow"" metaphor; rest is necessary to maintain function.
    *   **B)** Irrelevant to the plot.
    *   **C)** While the man was confused, the focal point is Aesop's explanation of his own behavior (the value of play).
    *   **D)** This describes the action of the story but not the underlying philosophical lesson.
    *   **E)** While true in many Aesop stories, the specific explanation given by Aesop focuses on the *necessity of rest* rather than the concealment of wisdom.

1.  **The Situation**: A sow (pig), known for having large litters, is bragging or questioning the lioness about her reproductive output.
2.  **The Conflict**: The sow defines success by ""how many"" (quantity). She produces many piglets, but they are common animals.
3.  **The Resolution**: The lioness acknowledges she only produces one offspring, but emphasizes that he is a **lion** (quality/nobility). 
4.  **The Lesson**: The story contrasts numerical abundance with the intrinsic value or excellence of a single individual. It suggests that one magnificent or high-quality result is superior to many mediocre ones.

Analyzing the options:
*   **A) Quality is more valuable than quantity**: This directly matches the contrast between the many piglets and the single ""well-bred"" lion.
*   **B) Gossips...**: Not relevant, as the story is about breeding and status, not rumors.
*   **C) Confidence without humility**: While the sow is overconfident, the moral focuses specifically on the ""one versus many"" dynamic.
*   **D) Proud disputes... lives in jeopardy**: This describes a fable like ""The Two Goats""; there is no life-threatening jeopardy here, only a verbal exchange.
*   **E) Nurturing is key**: The story does not focus on the process of raising the young, but on their inherent nature/quality.

The most accurate moral is that a single thing of great value is better than many things of low value.

morables_179,"Running swiftly, balancing on the razor's edge, bald but with a lock of hair on his forehead, he wears no clothes; if you grasp him from the front, you might be able to hold him, but once he has moved",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the symbolism provided in the text:

1.  **The Physical Appearance:** The figure (representing Opportunity or the Greek god Kairos) has a lock of hair on his forehead but is bald in the back. This means you can grab him as he approaches (from the front), but there is nothing to hold onto once he has passed by.
2.  **The Speed:** He is ""running swiftly"" and ""balancing on the razor's edge,"" emphasizing the fleeting nature of the moment.
3.  **The Consequence:** The text explicitly states that once he has moved on, ""not even Jupiter himself"" can pull him back. This underscores that once a moment is missed, it is gone forever.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The text defines the figure as ""a symbol of Opportunity, the brief moment in which things are possible.""

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Seize opportunities when they arise:** This aligns perfectly with the imagery of grabbing the forelock before the figure passes.
*   **B) Be content with your lot:** The story is about action and timing, not contentment.
*   **C) Power without purpose is ineffectual:** While Jupiter is mentioned, the focus is on the impossibility of reversing time, not a lack of purpose.
*   **D) Boast of one powerful thing...:** This refers to a different type of fable (often involving vanity or competition), which does not apply here.
*   **E) Every daring act teeters on the fine line...:** While ""razor's edge"" is mentioned, the core lesson is about the *briefness* of the window of action, not the nature of bravery.

The lesson is that opportunity is fleeting and must be caught at the exact moment it presents itself.

morables_597,"A fox was standing not far from a trap, pondering every possible approach. A nearby wolf noticed the fox and approached her. He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this story, let's analyze the characters and their actions step by step:

1.  **The Fox's Behavior:** The fox is clearly aware of the trap (she is ""pondering every possible approach""). Instead of warning the wolf, she uses false friendliness (""one of my very dearest friends"") and empty generosity (""help yourself"") to trick the wolf into triggering the trap for her. This is a classic act of deception and false flattery.
2.  **The Wolf's Mistake:** The wolf falls for the fox's kind words and acts ""without a moment's hesitation."" He values the flattery and the offer of ""friendship"" over a cautious assessment of why the meat was available in the first place.
3.  **The Result:** The fox used her ""friend"" as a tool to safely spring a trap she couldn't figure out how to bypass, harming the wolf in the process. 
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A:** Directly addresses the fox's deceptive behavior and the wolf's misplaced trust.
    *   **B:** While relevant to the wolf's lack of caution, it doesn't capture the essence of the fox's treachery.
    *   **C:** Too broad; the story focuses specifically on those who use kindness to mask harm.
    *   **D:** This is often the moral of ""The Cat and the Fox,"" but here the ""cunning"" isn't a skill being compared to another; it's a tool of betrayal.
    *   **E:** The collaboration here was forced and deceptive, not a genuine lesson in teamwork.

The core lesson is that when someone offers a ""gift"" or excessive kindness that seems too good to be true, one should be wary of their underlying motives. The fox’s flattery was used to hide a dangerous snare.

Winter was approaching, so one of the dung beetles said to the other, 'I want to g",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the interactions between the characters:

1.  **The Promise:** One beetle promises to bring back food for his companion if he finds a good feeding ground on the mainland.
2.  **The Reality:** The beetle finds an abundance of ""moist and fresh"" food. He enjoys it personally and becomes ""plump and fat.""
3.  **The Return:** When he returns empty-handed, he makes an excuse, blaming the ""nature of the place"" rather than his own failure to fulfill the promise.
4.  **The Lesson:** The second beetle benefited from the new location but failed to deliver on the commitment he made when he was planning his departure. This highlights that many people make grand promises when they are seeking a benefit or entering a new situation, but they do not follow through once they are comfortable or if the fulfillment requires effort.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Correct. The beetle made a promise before leaving (a ""good time"" of planning and opportunity) but failed to keep it, offering a lame excuse later.
*   **B:** Incorrect. There is no conflict or fight in the story.
*   **C:** Incorrect. While they found resources, the story focuses on the broken promise, not the discovery itself.
*   **D:** Incorrect. The story is not about the timing of work versus play.
*   **E:** Incorrect. While true of dung beetles generally, this is a literal observation, not the moral lesson of the interpersonal interaction.

The story serves as a warning about the reliability of others' promises when those promises are tested by self-interest or circumstance.

When they came to a well, one of them thought that they should jump in immediately, but the other one said, ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the behavior of the two characters:

1.  **The Situation:** The frogs have lost their home and need water to survive. They find a well.
2.  **The First Frog:** Sees the water and immediately wants to jump in to solve the immediate problem (thirst/dehydration).
3.  **The Second Frog:** Thinks about the potential long-term consequences. He realizes that while jumping into the well solves the immediate problem, the well is deep and enclosed. If that water dries up, they will be trapped at the bottom with no way to climb out.
4.  **The Lesson:** The second frog demonstrates the importance of considering the risks and consequences of an action before committing to it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Look before you leap:** This is a literal and figurative match. The story warns against jumping into a situation (the well) without considering how one might get out or what the future holds.
*   **B) Watch the actions of your enemy:** There are no enemies in this story. 
*   **C) Haste often leads to regret:** While true, ""Look before you leap"" is the specific idiomatic moral historically associated with this Aesop's fable (""The Two Frogs and the Well"").
*   **D) Impulsive, vicious people...:** This describes a different fable (like ""The Scorpion and the Frog""). These frogs are not vicious.
*   **E) Adaptability is key...:** The frogs are trying to adapt, but the story's focus is specifically on the caution required during that adaptation.

He saluted the gods who came to congratulate him one after another, but when he was approached by Plutus, the god of wealth and th",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Characters:** Hercules represents virtue and ""excellent qualities"" that earned him a place in heaven. Plutus is the god of wealth, associated with fortune rather than merit.
2.  **The Conflict:** Hercules willingly greets all the gods except for Plutus. He deliberately ignores the personification of wealth.
3.  **The Reason:** Hercules explains his disdain by stating that wealth is a ""friend to the wicked"" and ""corrupts the entire world."" He views wealth as a force that undermines moral integrity and rewards those who do not deserve it.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story contrasts Hercules' earned divinity (based on virtue) with Plutus' influence (based on money). The core message is that wealth is often associated with corruption and wickedness, whereas Hercules' status was achieved through merit.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Coffers of cash put a stop to honest traffic in praise:** This captures the essence of Hercules' complaint—that money corrupts and prevents people from being judged or ""praised"" based on their actual honesty or merit. (In many classic translations of Aesop, this specific wording is used for this fable). 
*   **B) Easy life... conceal a threat:** Not the primary focus.
*   **C) Wealth cannot buy true excellence:** While true, the fable focuses more on how wealth actively corrupts the world and helps the wicked.
*   **D) Corrupting thieves... entangled:** This focuses on a different narrative arc not present here.
*   **E) Virtue paves the path:** This is the setup for the story, but the specific interaction with Plutus is meant to highlight the corruptive nature of riches.

Option A is the most traditional and accurate moral for this specific Aesop's fable, emphasizing that wealth interferes with the honest valuation of a person's character.

morables_301,"A dog made false accusations against the sheep, demanding that she pay him back a loaf of bread which, he insisted, the sheep had supposedly borrowed from him. The dog summoned the wolf as his witness",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the narrative elements:

1.  **The Conflict:** A dog and a wolf conspire to frame an innocent sheep through false testimony (lying).
2.  **The Consequence for the Victim:** The sheep is unjustly punished and forced to pay for a ""debt"" she never incurred.
3.  **The Resolution:** Shortly after the injustice, the sheep discovers the wolf (the liar) dead in a ditch.
4.  **The Lesson:** The sheep explicitly states, ""This is the reward that gods give to liars,"" indicating that divine or natural justice has caught up with the perpetrator.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Directly aligns with the sheep's conclusion and the wolf's fate. It suggests that while liars may succeed temporarily, they eventually face retribution.
*   **B:** Focuses on using harsh means to teach others, which is not the focus of this story.
*   **C:** While true in the plot, it is a statement of fact rather than the lesson/moral intended by the wolf's death.
*   **D:** This suggests a pattern of behavior regarding insults, which doesn't fit the ""divine justice"" theme.
*   **E:** While false claims do destroy trust, the story focuses more on the ultimate fate of the liar.

morables_428,"A Lark, caught in a snare, pleaded earnestly with the Fowler for her life. 'What have I done that I must die?' said she; 'I have stolen neither gold nor silver, but only a grain of corn to satisfy my ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** A Lark is trapped in a snare and faces immediate danger from the Fowler (the bird-catcher).
2.  **The Plea:** The Lark attempts to defend herself by appealing to logic and morality. She argues that her ""crime"" (eating a grain of corn) is insignificant and does not justify the death penalty.
3.  **The Adversary:** The Fowler is not an impartial observer; he is the person who set the trap and intends to benefit from her capture. He is both the accuser and the executioner.
4.  **The Outcome:** The Fowler ignores her reasoning entirely (""without deigning any reply"") and kills her.

**Analysis of choices:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The Lark expects a fair ""trial"" based on her innocence, but the Fowler has a vested interest in her death. Reasoning with someone who has already decided your fate for their own benefit is futile.
*   **B:** While the Lark died for a ""grain of corn,"" the focus of the fable is on the interaction between the captor and the captive, not necessarily the risk-taking of the bird.
*   **C:** This is nonsensical in the context of the story; there was no mercy shown.
*   **D:** This is a convoluted variation of ""a bird in the hand,"" which doesn't apply to the Lark's plea for life.
*   **E:** The story explicitly shows that sincerity was **not** a powerful plea, as the Fowler ignored it.

The story teaches that justice and logic carry no weight when the person deciding your fate is the one who profits from your demise.

morables_82,"Be quiet now, said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap. If you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf. Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Premise:** A Nurse makes a threat to a child (""I will throw you to the Wolf"") that she does not actually intend to keep. It is an empty promise/threat used to manipulate behavior.
2.  **The Conflict:** A Wolf, hearing this, believes the Nurse is speaking the truth. He adjusts his actions based on the expectation that the Nurse will fulfill her word.
3.  **The Climax:** When the child cries (the trigger for the promise), the Wolf approaches to collect his ""morsel.""
4.  **The Resolution:** The Nurse does the opposite of what she said; she protects the child and sets dogs on the Wolf.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) Enemies' promises were made to be broken:** This is the traditional moral of this Aesop fable (*The Nurse and the Wolf*). It warns that you shouldn't trust the words of those who are not your friends, as their ""promises"" or threats are often unreliable or deceptive.
*   **B, C, D:** These do not align with the narrative arc. There is no blame shifting (B), the ""cunning plan"" of the nurse was just a lie that almost got her in trouble (C), and the Wolf wasn't ""serving"" the nurse (D).
*   **E) Harsh words may hide a misguided attempt at protection:** While this describes the Nurse's behavior, it is not the traditional moral, which focuses on the Wolf's folly in believing the words of a human (his enemy).

The story teaches that one should not take every word literally, especially when it comes from a source that has no reason to benefit you. The wolf was a fool for believing a human would actually hand over a child.

Then the fly laughed at the man and said, 'You wanted to avenge the sting of a ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the dialogue and the conflict between the man and the fly:

1.  **The Conflict:** The fly mocks the man for hitting himself while trying to swat the fly. The fly argues that the man is foolish for causing himself pain (insult to injury) in an attempt to kill a small insect.
2.  **The Man's Defense:** The man explicitly distinguishes between his self-inflicted slap and the fly's bite. He states, ""I can easily forgive myself since I know that I did **not try to hurt myself on purpose**.""
3.  **The Comparison:** The man views his own mistake as blameless because his **intent** was not self-harm, whereas he views the fly as a malicious actor. He is willing to endure personal physical discomfort (the slap) if his goal (the intent to kill the fly) is achieved.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core of the man's argument rests on the idea that the internal motivation behind an action (intent) defines its moral weight or its forgivability, rather than the physical result (the bruise from the slap).

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Intent matters more than the outcome:** This aligns directly with the man's justification that unintentional self-harm is forgivable because the intent was to punish an enemy.
*   **B), C), and D):** These do not capture the specific logic used in the man's rebuttal.
*   **E) In anger, we may cause ourselves more harm...:** While this is a common theme in fables, the man in *this* specific version of the story (Phaedrus/Aesop) rejects this notion by arguing that his self-harm doesn't matter as long as his intent was righteous.

The story emphasizes that while a mistake made against oneself is excusable due to lack of bad intent, a small injury from a malicious source warrants any effort—intentional or otherwise—to stop it.

The Hunter agreed, but said: 'If you desire to conquer the Stag, you mus",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the consequences:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Horse wants revenge on the Stag but cannot achieve it alone.
2.  **The Trade-off:** The Horse asks a Hunter for help. The Hunter agrees, but only if the Horse surrenders his autonomy (accepting the bit, bridle, and saddle).
3.  **The Result:** The Horse achieves his short-term goal (defeating the Stag), but in doing so, he has permanently placed himself under the Hunter's control.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Hunter refuses to release the Horse, realizing that the Horse is now a useful tool/servant. 

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Captures the dynamic where the Hunter uses the Horse's desire for revenge to enslave him.
*   **B:** This is a classic interpretation of this specific Aesop's fable (*The Horse and the Stag*). It suggests that enduring a grievance (the Stag) is better than sacrificing your liberty to a greater power (the Hunter), because once you give someone power over you, they rarely give it back.
*   **C:** The Hunter uses cunning, but ""Cunning can defeat dominance"" doesn't quite capture the tragedy of the Horse's lost freedom.
*   **D:** This focuses on vengeance, but the lasting impact of the story is the Horse's loss of liberty, not just the fleeting nature of pleasure.
*   **E:** This is a strong contender, but ""guidance"" is a soft term for the physical bondage (bit and spur) and permanent servitude described.

In traditional collections of Aesop's fables, the primary lesson taught is that liberty should not be sacrificed for the sake of revenge or short-term gains. Option B most accurately reflects the core warning: it is better to leave an injury unavenged than to enslave yourself to another in order to seek redress.

You have such ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Cat's Intent:** The cat wants the eel but doesn't want to get wet. He first tries flattery (""O most beautiful bird!"") to get the stork to open her mouth and drop the fish. When that fails, he turns to insults to provoke a reaction.
2.  **The Stork's Action:** The stork realizes that opening her mouth to respond—either to the flattery or the insults—would result in losing her prize (the eel).
3.  **The Lesson:** The stork remains silent and keeps walking, prioritizing her goal (the meal) over the distractions of the cat's manipulation. While the cat's behavior involves flattery and deception (options D and E), the stork’s success comes from her steadfast refusal to be distracted or baited.

Comparing the options:
- **A) Stay focused on your goals:** This directly reflects the stork's behavior. She refuses to be distracted by either praise or insults because she has a specific objective.
- **B) Death:** Irrelevant to this story.
- **C) Beauty masking cunning:** While the cat used ""beautiful"" words, the cat himself isn't the focal point of the lesson; the stork's discipline is.
- **D) Don't be seduced by cunning words:** This is a secondary lesson, but the story also includes the stork ignoring insults, not just ""beautiful"" words.
- **E) Flattery masks hidden intentions:** Similar to D, this only covers the first half of the cat's tactics.

The most encompassing moral for the stork's successful behavior is staying focused on the task at hand despite external provocations.

1.  **The Situation:** The wolf had a sure thing (the dog) in his grasp but was persuaded to let it go based on a promise of something better in the future (a fatter dog).
2.  **The Mistake:** The wolf traded immediate gain for a future promise. He allowed himself to be tricked by the dog's clever words.
3.  **The Outcome:** The dog secured his safety (moving to the roof) and mocked the wolf for expecting him to keep a promise that was made under duress.
4.  **The Lesson:** The dog's final remark (""if you ever catch me sleeping in front of the barn again, don't wait"") highlights that the wolf missed his only opportunity. A wise person (or wolf) does not give up a present advantage for a future promise that may never be fulfilled.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Take what you can get when you can get it:** This directly addresses the wolf's failure to secure his meal when he had the chance.
*   **B) Liberty:** Not the primary focus.
*   **C) The cunning prey on the gullible:** While true, the story is more specifically about missing an opportunity.
*   **D) Cunning enemies' persuasive promises...:** This is overly complex and mislabels the ""predatory nature"" in the context of the dog (the prey).
*   **E) Delaying the inevitable:** The dog escaped permanently, so it wasn't inevitable.

When he finally decided to disembark, he said, 'I will let myself down now as fast as I can so as not to burden",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interaction between the gnat and the camel:

1.  **The Gnat's Perspective:** The gnat believes his presence is a significant burden to the camel. He speaks as if his departure is a great favor that will provide relief to the ""weighed down"" animal. This shows he overestimates his importance and the impact of his actions.
2.  **The Camel's Perspective:** The camel, being much larger and carrying heavy baggage, did not even notice the gnat's arrival and is indifferent to his departure. To the camel, the gnat is inconsequential.
3.  **The Lesson:** The contrast between the gnat's self-importance and the camel's lack of awareness illustrates that individuals often perceive themselves as far more influential or burdensome than they actually are to others.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This directly addresses the discrepancy between the gnat’s self-perception (of great consequence/weight) and the camel’s perception (not even aware he was there).
*   **B:** While the gnat is arguably arrogant, the focus isn't strictly on ""influence"" in a social/political sense, but on the delusion of self-importance.
*   **C & D:** These focus on patience and wisdom, which are characteristics of the camel, but the primary irony of the fable lies in the gnat’s misplaced ego.
*   **E:** While true in the literal sense, it describes a fact of the story rather than a moral lesson regarding human behavior or ego.

1.  **The Observation:** The fox sees humans eating roast chicken. Because humans own the chickens, their act is ""lawful"" and socially acceptable within their own context.
2.  **The Fox's Complaint:** The fox points out a double standard. If he were to eat a chicken, he would be hunted, shouted at, and attacked by dogs. He views this as an unfair hypocrisy.
3.  **The Rebuttal:** The old woman points out the fundamental difference: the women are consuming their own property (""things which are ours""), whereas the fox's survival depends on stealing (""things that belong to others"").
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that rights and permissions are tied to ownership and social standing. What is acceptable for a person to do with their own property is not a license for a stranger or a thief to do the same.

**Analysis of the options:**

morables_245,"A viper entered a blacksmith's workshop and bit the file, testing it to see if this was something she could eat. The file protested fiercely, 'You fool! Why are you trying to wound me with your teeth,",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the viper and the file:

1.  **The Action:** A viper tries to bite a metal file, treating it as if it were soft prey that could be wounded or consumed.
2.  **The Reaction:** The file points out the futility of the viper's actions. The file is made of hardened iron and is designed to ""gnaw"" or wear down other metals; therefore, the viper's teeth cannot harm it.
3.  **The Lesson:** The viper is attacking something that is far more durable and ""tougher"" than itself—an object that cannot feel pain and is immune to the viper's venom. The story highlights the futility of trying to harm someone or something that is impervious to your attacks or is essentially ""unshakeable.""

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) It is useless attacking the insensible.** This aligns with the lesson: ""insensible"" refers to something that lacks feeling or is unyielding (like a metal tool). Attacking it only hurts the attacker.
*   **B)** This focuses on asking for help, which isn't present in the story.
*   **C)** While the viper is foolish, the core of the fable is specifically about attacking something stronger/impervious.
*   **D)** This mentions forgiveness/indignation, which aren't the primary themes.
*   **E)** The file only speaks *after* being attacked; it didn't boast to invite the challenge.

The traditional moral of Aesop’s ""The Viper and the File"" is that it is foolish to attack those who can hurt you more than you can hurt them, or to attack those who are insensible to your malice.

morables_75,"A Man and a Lion traveled together through the forest. They soon began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and prowess. As they were disputing, they passed a statue carv",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the Man and the Lion:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Man and the Lion are arguing about who is superior.
2.  **The Evidence:** The Man points to a statue as ""proof"" of human superiority because it depicts a man defeating a lion.
3.  **The Counterpoint:** The Lion points out a logical fallacy: the statue exists only because a human created it. If a lion were the sculptor, the imagery would be reversed to show the lion's dominance.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that ""truth"" or ""history"" is often shaped by the perspective of the person telling the story (or carving the statue). Evidence is often biased toward the creator of that evidence.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) One story is good, till another is told:** This aligns perfectly with the lion’s point. The man's ""story"" (the statue) seemed definitive until the lion provided the perspective of the alternative ""story"" that could be told.
*   **B) The hero is brave in deeds...:** This is not relevant to the dispute regarding representation and perspective.
*   **C) Pride often precedes a fall:** While they are boasting, no one actually ""falls"" at the end of the story.
*   **D) Boastful outside show...:** While relevant to external appearances, it doesn't capture the specific theme of subjective perspective.
*   **E) Pride often blinds us...:** The story is about points of view, not the failure to cooperate.

The most accurate moral is that perspective dictating narrative: we only see one side of a story until the other side is presented.

On his way to the assembly of the birds, the peaco",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character's motivations:

1.  **The Character's Motivation:** The peacock is described as beautiful and gentle. However, he agrees to give away his feathers specifically in exchange for the raven ""squawking his praises"" in front of other birds. This indicates a desire for social validation, fame, and the ego-boost provided by flattery (vanity).
2.  **The Action:** The peacock continues to give away his feathers to several other birds (the crow, the cuckoo, etc.) until he has none left. He prioritizes the immediate gratification of being praised over the practical necessity of his own plumage.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he gave away his feathers for the sake of his reputation/vanity, he lost his ability to protect his chicks and himself. Without feathers for warmth, he died when winter came.
4.  **The Lesson:** The peacock’s desire to hear his own praises (vanity/pride) blinded him to his own survival needs and responsibilities. By trading his essential resources for empty words, he caused his own downfall.

Analysis of the options:
*   **A) Vanity can lead to self-destruction:** This fits perfectly. The peacock's need for praise (vanity) led him to give away his means of survival, resulting in his death.
*   **B) Do not boast to have something you do not:** The peacock actually had the feathers, so this doesn't fit.
*   **C) Opportunism can overshadow courtesy:** While the other birds were opportunistic, the story focuses on the peacock's choices and the fatal result of those choices.
*   **D) Sorrow not over what is abandoned...:** This does not reflect the peacock's lack of foresight or the tragic ending.
*   **E) True beauty shines through kindness...:** The story ends in death and failure, suggesting that his ""kindness"" (or rather, his susceptibility to flattery) was a flaw, not a triumph.

The most accurate moral is that seeking flattery and prioritizing one's image over one's needs leads to ruin.

You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth as a w",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot progression:

1.  **The Conflict:** A tiny Gnat challenges a mighty Lion, mocking the Lion's strength as no better than a ""woman in her quarrels.""
2.  **The Victory:** Through agility and strategy (stinging the Lion's sensitive, hairless spots), the Gnat causes the Lion to defeat himself. The Gnat is the victor over the ""hugest of beasts.""
3.  **The Downfall:** Immediately following his victory, the Gnat is consumed by pride and ""buzzing about in a song of triumph."" Because he is not paying attention to his surroundings or is overconfident, he flies into a spider's web—a trap set by an ""inconsiderable"" insect.
4.  **The Reflection:** The Gnat laments that after defeating the greatest enemy, he is destroyed by a minor one.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) No matter how you brag, you can be undone:** This fits the narrative well. The Gnat's triumph and subsequent bragging are immediately followed by a pathetic defeat. It highlights the reversal of fortune.
*   **B) Do not ever trust your enemy...:** This does not fit, as the Lion was never ""humble and supplicating.""
*   **C) Pride can turn triumph into frustration:** While close, ""frustration"" is too weak a word for being eaten by a spider.
*   **D) Boastful cunning often outwits its frustrated self:** This is confusingly worded and implies the Gnat outwitted himself, rather than being caught by a separate external threat (the spider).
*   **E) True strength is not always visible:** While true of the Gnat's victory over the Lion, it doesn't account for the second half of the story where the Gnat dies.

**Conclusion:** The core lesson of Aesop’s fable ""The Gnat and the Lion"" is that great success does not make one invincible, and pride in one's victory often leads to a lapse in caution, allowing even a small threat to cause one's downfall. Option A best encapsulates the irony of a great victor being undone by a small oversight.

All of a sudden a tuna fish",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events:
1. **Effort vs. Outcome:** the fishermen worked hard (struggled for a long time) but failed to catch anything using their professional skills and tools.
2. **State of Mind:** They were ready to give up and were ""downcast,"" indicating that their labor had yielded no results.
3. **The Turning Point:** A tuna fish literally falls into their lap (leaps into the boat) not because of their fishing ability, but because it was fleeing a predator. 
4. **Conclusion:** They achieved their goal through a stroke of unexpected fortune rather than their own merit or perseverance.

**Evaluating the options:**
- **A) Luck often bestows the things that skill cannot obtain:** This aligns perfectly with the narrative. The fishermen's skill failed them, but a random stroke of luck provided the catch.
- **B) To be small is a way to stay safe...:** This is a moral for a different fable (like ""The Two Pots"" or ""The Fir Tree and the Bramble""). Here, being a small fish (the tuna) was actually dangerous.
- **C) Joy can outpace despair:** While true in a literal sense, it is too vague to be a traditional Aesop-style moral.
- **D) Rejoicing equals make the best pursuing friends:** This is a nonsensical phrasing.
- **E) In the face of empty nets, perseverance becomes its own reward:** In this story, perseverance did *not* bring the reward; they were actually about to give up when the fish jumped in.

Not withstanding all his prayers, instead of becoming richer, he got poorer. Out ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Devotion:** A man prays to a wooden idol for wealth, showing traditional piety and belief.
2.  **The Failure:** Despite his prayers, he becomes poorer. The deity (the belief system) is not ""profitable"" or effective for him.
3.  **The Turning Point:** In a fit of rage and impatience, he destroys the idol—an act of sacrilege and a total rejection of his previous belief.
4.  **The Reward:** The destruction reveals hidden gold.
5.  **The Lesson/Change in Belief:** The man concludes that the deity was ""graceless"" and only provides when forced, rather than through prayer. His entire perspective on how to interact with the divine/the idol shifts based on the material outcome he received.

**Analysis of the Options:**
- **A:** This fits the man's shift in perception perfectly. When prayer failed, he viewed the idol as a god; when violence brought money, he viewed the idol as a ""graceless deity"" that must be forced. His ""belief"" (how he views and treats the idol) changed based on what path finally yielded the gold.
- **B:** This is more of a philosophical statement on aesthetics and madness, which doesn't fit the irony of the gold discovery.
- **C:** The outcome was actually ""graceful"" (profitable), so this is incorrect.
- **D:** This is a nonsensical phrase in the context of the fable.
- **E:** While the man was bold, the irony is specifically about the shift in his attitude toward the ""worthless"" idol once it became profitable.

Historically, this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Man and the Wooden God"") is frequently used to illustrate that some people only respect or ""believe"" in things based on the material benefits they receive, or that their devotion is tied to profit.

Then the little gnat said to the bull, 'It's enough for me that you have accepted my ch",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Interaction:** A tiny gnat challenges a massive, powerful bull. Under normal circumstances, there is no competition between the two because their strength levels are incomparable.
2.  **The Gnat's Strategy:** The gnat claims victory not by winning a physical fight, but by the mere fact that the bull *accepted* the challenge. By agreeing to compete, the bull implicitly acknowledged the gnat as a peer or a legitimate threat.
3.  **The Outcome:** The gnat gains status and boasting rights, while the bull is left looking foolish for engaging with an opponent so far beneath his ""mighty bulk."" 
4.  **The Author's Commentary:** The text explicitly states that if the bull had ignored the gnat (""dismissed this opponent as beneath contempt""), the gnat would have had nothing to boast about.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Matches the story perfectly. By engaging with the ""unworthy"" gnat, the bull lowered himself to the gnat's level and damaged his own reputation.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; the story is not about child-rearing or education.
*   **C:** While pride is involved, the specific lesson is about the *choice of opponent* and the loss of dignity, not a classic ""fall"" from a high position.
*   **D:** Nonsensical in the context of the story.
*   **E:** Close, but the story emphasizes the loss of status/equalization of the parties rather than just the futility of the contest.

The central lesson is that one should not dignify an unworthy challenger with a response, as doing so grants them an unearned status of equality.

The owner began to question the dog, asking how he could be so ungra",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the dialogue and the conflict between the owner and the dog:

1.  **The Conflict:** The owner believes he has been ""kind"" because he personally never struck the dog or spoke harshly to him. He uses this lack of direct physical aggression to claim moral superiority.
2.  **The Dog’s Perspective:** The dog points out that while the owner didn't physically strike him, the owner *ordered* others to do it.
3.  **The Lesson:** The dog concludes that being beaten by order of the owner is the same as being beaten by the owner himself. The responsibility for an action lies with the person who authorizes or causes it, not just the person who physically performs it.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) What a person does through another is truly their own action:** This aligns perfectly with the dog's argument that an order given to another is the same as doing it oneself.
*   **B) There is danger lurking in the words of a wicked person:** While the owner is hypocritical, the story focus is on delegation of action, not just ""wicked words.""
*   **C) Kindness is often unappreciated:** The story refutes the idea that the owner was actually kind.
*   **D) Better to face a known danger...:** This is the moral of a different type of fable (often involving a predator and prey).
*   **E) Distinctive traits...:** This describes a plot point (the bob-tail), but not the philosophical ""moral"" of the dialogue.

The story teaches that one cannot escape responsibility for an act by hiring or ordering someone else to do it.

Even when they saw one of",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"Here is a step-by-step analysis of the fable's moral:

1.  **Analyze the Plot:** The flock of sheep watches as a butcher systematically removes individuals one by one. Instead of joining together to stop the threat, they rationalize their safety based on the fact that someone else was chosen (""He keeps his hands off me... let him take whom he takes"").
2.  **Identify the Turning Point:** The sheep only realize their mistake when they are the last one remaining and there is no longer a ""flock"" to offer protection or resistance.
3.  **Evaluate the Realization:** The final sheep admits that they should have acted collectively (""when we were all together"") to stop the butcher. By failing to act when others were targeted, they ensured their own eventual demise.
4.  **Compare to the Options:**
    *   **A** directly addresses the theme of failing to support others, leading to a situation where one is left alone and defenseless. This mirrors the famous sentiment of ""First they came for..."", which is the quintessential interpretation of this fable.
    *   **B** refers to the folly of jumping from ""the frying pan into the fire,"" which doesn't fit here.
    *   **C** is a general platitude but doesn't capture the specific social failure of the sheep.
    *   **D** relates to rhetoric or insults, which is irrelevant.
    *   **E** suggests the sheep were trying to ""fit in"" with the butcher, but they were actually just ignoring him out of a false sense of individual security.

The core lesson is that collective action is necessary for survival, and ignoring the plight of others eventually leads to one's own ruin.

1.  **The Initial Act:** A hooligan commits a reckless, harmful act (striking Aesop) and is unexpectedly rewarded with money instead of being punished.
2.  **The Deception:** Aesop uses the reward to create a false sense of security and success in the hooligan's mind, convincing him that his bad behavior is a profitable strategy.
3.  **The Climax:** Encouraged by his previous ""success,"" the hooligan repeats the behavior against someone with the power to punish him.
4.  **The Result:** The hooligan's belief that his previous success would continue leads him directly to his execution.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Success leads many astray to their ruin:** This perfectly fits the narrative. The hooligan’s initial ""success"" (getting a coin) blinded him to the danger of his actions, leading him to commit a crime that resulted in his death.
*   **B) Be careful what you wish for:** The hooligan didn't ""wish"" for something that backfired; he acted and was tricked.
*   **C) Clever minds outwit reckless wealth:** Aesop was clever, but the target was a wealthy person, not ""reckless wealth.""
*   **D) Avoid reckless overindulgence in manipulative pursuits:** This is too wordy and doesn't quite capture the ""false success"" aspect.
*   **E) Responding with grace can disarm hostility:** Aesop didn't respond with grace to disarm; he responded with a trick to ensure the hooligan was punished.

In Phaedrus's collection of Aesop's fables, this specific story (often titled ""Aesop and the Hooligan"") is traditionally used to illustrate how an easy success in wrongdoing can embolden a person to their own destruction.

1.  **Winter’s Perspective:** Winter prides himself on being a ""dictator"" or ""despot."" He uses fear to control people, forcing them to stay indoors, look down at the ground, and tremble. He views his ability to constrain and frighten others as a display of power.
2.  **Spring’s Perspective:** Spring points out that because Winter rules through fear and discomfort, people are ""glad to get rid of"" him. In contrast, Spring brings pleasure, freedom, and joy. Because Spring is kind and brings happiness, people look forward to her arrival and remember her fondly when she is gone.
3.  **The Lesson:** The contrast is between ruling/existing through intimidation (Winter) versus ruling/existing through beauty and kindness (Spring). The story concludes that being welcomed and remembered with affection is superior to being a powerful figure who is лишь feared and eventually shunned.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) It is better to be loved than feared.** This directly addresses the contrast between Winter's ""despotic"" fear and Spring's ""pleasant"" love.
*   **B) Use care to place your blame...** This is irrelevant to the story.
*   **C) Power can be both beloved and despotic.** While true in a literal sense, the story explicitly favors the beloved over the despotic.
*   **D) Powerful talent is wasted...** The story focuses on the nature of the ""power"" used, not the quality of the audience's appreciation.
*   **E) Even the harshest seasons have their beauty...** The story actually portrays Winter as strictly harsh and unpleasant, without focusing on its hidden beauty.

The core lesson is that a legacy of kindness and the pleasure of being loved is more desirable than the oppressive power of being feared.

Everyone wondered at this, since the new horse was neithe",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation:** A soldier possesses an ""excellent horse"" (proven and high quality) but buys a second horse that is ""not nearly as good"" (inferior quality).
2.  **The Action:** Despite the second horse being less beautiful and less useful, the soldier devotes ""more care"" to it than to his first, superior horse.
3.  **The Observation/Reaction:** Observers are confused by this irrational behavior.
4.  **The Explanation:** The quote ""it's natural to be fond of the newest arrival"" suggests that the soldier's favoritism is driven solely by novelty rather than merit or value.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Everything pleases at first...** - This explores the fleeting nature of novelty, but the story focuses more on the *current* misplaced value rather than the eventual loss of interest.
*   **B) Satisfied with their own lot...** - This is irrelevant to the soldier's choice between two possessions.
*   **C) Beauty fades, but usefulness endures.** - The story actually says the new horse is *neither* as beautiful nor as useful, so this doesn't fit.
*   **D) The inferior word of a wicked man...** - This is irrelevant to the context of the horses.
*   **E) We value what is less worthy more than what truly deserves our care.** - This directly addresses the soldier’s behavior: he ignores the ""excellent"" horse (worthy) to pamper the ""not nearly as good"" horse (less worthy) simply because it is new.

This fable (attributed to Aesop or similar traditions) illustrates how novelty can blind people to true value, leading them to prioritize inferior things over superior ones.

A Kite saw him and exclaimed: 'You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no bus",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Event:** A seagull attempts to eat a fish that is too large for it. This results in a physical injury (a burst gullet) that leads to the bird's impending death. 
2.  **The Critique:** A Kite (a bird of prey that typically hunts land animals) observes the dying seagull and mocks it.
3.  **The Logic of the Critique:** The Kite argues that the seagull suffered because it stepped outside of its natural domain (""a bird of the air has no business to seek its food from the sea"").
4.  **The Lesson:** While the seagull's death was caused by over-ambition or a physical accident, the fable uses the Kite's dialogue to highlight the theme of sticking to one's own sphere of life or nature. In Aesop's fables, this specific story (The Kite and the Seagull) is traditionally used to illustrate that trouble often arises when one meddles in affairs or environments that are not their own.

*   **Option A** fits this perfectly: ""Every man should be content to mind his own business"" (interpreted here as sticking to one's own natural calling or environment).
*   **Option B** is incorrect as the seagull does not survive to learn.
*   **Option C** touches on greed, but the specific dialogue focuses on the ""sea vs. air"" distinction.

1.  **The Situation:** A group of foxes is thirsty, but the river current is dangerous and intimidating.
2.  **The Action:** One fox decides to show off. She isn't motivated by a safe way to drink, but by the desire to ""embarrass her fellow foxes"" and prove she is ""braver than the rest.""

4.  **The Reaction:** When her friends mockingly ask her to come back and show them the way, she makes up an excuse (carrying a message to Miletus) to hide the fact that she is helpless and in danger.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The fox's boastful desire to appear superior led her to take a reckless risk that resulted in her being swept away.
*   **B:** There is no mention of ""profit"" or ""greed"" in the financial sense; the motivation was social status/pride.
*   **C & E:** These options suggest the fox was successful or that her boldness was a positive trait, but the story ends with her being swept away and making excuses for her failure.
*   **D:** While there is mockery involved, the primary lesson focuses on the person who put themselves in danger through vanity, not the ""neighbors.""

This fable (often attributed to Aesop) is intended to warn against those who bring misfortune upon themselves through ostentation and boasting.

morables_251,"When the lion made himself king of the beasts, he wanted to be known for his fairness, so he gave up his old habits and contented himself with a limited diet just as the other animals did, committed t",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Lion's Predicament:** The lion tries to act against his nature (predation) by being a ""fair"" king, but his natural hunger returns.
2.  **The Trap:** He creates a ""no-win"" situation. He asks animals if his breath smells. If they are honest (it smells bad), they are killed. If they are sycophants (it smells good), they are killed.
3.  **The Monkey's Attempt:** The monkey tries extreme flattery (""it smells of cinnamon""). Though this temporarily stalls the lion, the lion simply invents a different excuse (pretending to be sick) to eat the monkey anyway.
4.  **The Result:** Regardless of whether the animals were honest, dishonest, or overly complimentary, they all met the same fate because of the lion's inherent nature and power.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** captures the cynical reality of the story: no matter what response the animals gave (truth or lie/silence/flattery), the outcome was the same.
*   **B** is irrelevant to this specific plot.
*   **C** describes the lion, but the moral focus is usually on the victim's inability to escape the predator's whim. 
*   **D** refers to the ""ass in the lion's skin,"" which is a different fable.
*   **E** is the opposite of the story's outcome.

While the story highlights the danger of flattery, the core ""trap"" described involves the lion's strategy where both ""yes"" and ""no"" answers lead to death. The monkey's fate proves that even the most creative flattery cannot save one from a tyrant who has decided to eat you. In many traditional collections of Aesop's fables (specifically the Babrius or Phaedrus versions), this specific tale concludes that for those in the power of a tyrant, there is no safe thing to say.

morables_579,"A man bought a partridge and let him run loose in the house since he liked the bird very much. The partridge immediately started squawking his usual song, sauntering through every room in the house un",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the behavior of the characters and the conflict between them:

1.  **The Action:** A newcomer (the partridge) enters a new environment and immediately begins to behave loudly and boldly (""squawking,"" ""sauntering,"" ""cackling"") as if he owns the place.
2.  **The Conflict:** The resident (the weasel) challenges this behavior. The weasel points out that despite having lived there for a long time and being born there, she remains quiet and humble. 
3.  **The Contrast:** The story contrasts the ""newcomer's"" boastful and loud behavior with the ""old-timer's"" reserved nature. The weasel's question, ""What gives you the right to speak so freely... if you have only just now become a member of the household?"" highlights the impropriety of the partridge's lack of humility.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable serves as a warning against being overconfident or loud when one is a guest or a new arrival. One should observe and respect the established order and customs of a place before asserting themselves so boldly.

Comparing this to the options:
*   **A)** Directly addresses the breach of etiquette shown by the partridge.
*   **B)** Irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C)** The partridge is not outsmarting the weasel; the weasel is actually criticizing the partridge.
*   **D)** While vanity is present, ""tricky self-destruction"" isn't fully realized in the text provided (though implying danger).
*   **E)** Too broad; the specific context is about social hierarchy and newness.

The most fitting moral is that newcomers should be humble and respect the customs of their new environment.

morables_39,"A fox climbing up over a fence was about to slip and fall, so she reached out and grabbed hold of a bramble bush but the brambles scratched the soft padding of the fox's paws. Stung by the sharp pain,",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the interaction between the fox and the bramble:

1.  **The Situation:** The fox is in trouble and grabs the bramble bush for support without thinking about the nature of the bush.
2.  **The Consequence:** The bramble bush, which is naturally covered in thorns meant to snag and scratch, hurts the fox.
3.  **The Lesson:** The bramble’s response—""I am the one who always grabs everyone else""—highlights its inherent nature. The bramble isn't being ""cruel"" in a calculated way; it is simply being what it is. The fox made the mistake of relying on something that is intrinsically harmful or prickly for help.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) It is foolish to expect help from someone who is naturally unkind/harmful:** This fits perfectly. The fox expected support from an entity whose very nature is to snag and sting.
*   **B) No one should boast...:** There is no boasting about prowess in this story.
*   **C) Cruelty stings the sharpest:** While the fox feels pain, the focus is on the *mistake* of the fox's choice, not just the sensation of pain.
*   **D) A single sharp skill...:** This refers to a different fable (The Fox and the Cat).
*   **E) In seeking support, be mindful of the harm it may cause:** This is a plausible interpretation, but traditional Aesop's fables focus on the foolishness of misjudging the character of others. Option A is the more standard ""moral"" regarding the nature of the individuals we turn to.

The core lesson is that we should not be surprised when someone with a harmful or difficult reputation acts according to their nature, even when we are in need.

But the fuller told him, 'How on earth would I be able to carr",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the roles of the two characters:

1.  **The Charcoal Burner:** His profession involves soot, dust, and black residue. His work inherently creates a messy environment.
2.  **The Fuller:** His profession involves cleaning and whitening cloth. His work inherently requires a pristine, spotless environment.

The fuller realizes that their lifestyles/professions are fundamentally at odds. If they lived together, the charcoal burner's soot would ruin the fuller's clean work. The story teaches that people with inherently conflicting natures or incompatible ways of life cannot successfully join forces or live in close quarters because one will inevitably undermine the other.

*   **A) Opposites are utterly incompatible:** This directly reflects the conflict between the ""black"" soot of the burner and the ""white"" cloth of the fuller.
*   **B) Appearances can be deceiving:** This is not relevant here; the characters are exactly what they appear to be.
*   **C, D, and E:** While they touch on elements of caution or shared space, they do not capture the core ""black and white"" conflict presented in Aesop's original logic. 

Classic interpretations of this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Charcoal-Burner and the Fuller"") conclude that ""like should associate with like"" or that those with incompatible habits should not attempt to join together.

morables_446,"A robber had murdered someone along the road. When the bystanders began to chase him, he dropped the bloody corpse and ran away. Some travellers coming from the opposite direction asked the man how he",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Crime and Deception:** A robber commits a murder and, when confronted by travelers about the blood on his hands, he lies by blaming the mulberry tree (claiming he just climbed down from one).
2.  **The Retribution:** The pursuers catch him and execute him on that very same tree.
3.  **The Dialogue:** The tree speaks, noting that it is happy to facilitate his execution because the murderer tried to defame it by using it as a cover for his crime.

**Analyzing the Options:**
- **B, C, and D** do not align closely with the specific dialogue of the tree or the irony of the murderer being killed by the very thing he slandered.
- **E** is a reasonable observation, but it doesn't capture the ""retribution"" aspect of the story.
- **A** reflects the core of the tree's final statement. In the context of the fable, the ""honest person"" (or entity) is the tree. The tree, which is normally passive/blameless, does not ""hesitate to persecute"" (support the execution of) the man because he attempted to ""slander"" it (blame it for the blood/crime). 

In classical collections of Aesop's Fables (where this story originates as ""The Murderer and the Mulberry Tree""), the traditional moral focuses on how those who are slandered or used as a scapegoat by the wicked will eventually see justice served against their detractors. Option A most accurately captures the ""eye for an eye"" dynamic of the victimized party (the tree) participating in the villain's punishment.

morables_430,Some field-mice were playing in the woods where a lion was sleeping when one of the mice accidentally ran over the lion. The lion woke up and immediately grabbed the wretched little mouse with his paw,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the character interactions:

1.  **The Act of Mercy:** The lion is a powerful creature who chooses to spare a ""tiny creature"" (the mouse) despite having the power to kill it. The lion views the mouse as insignificant but chooses kindness over unnecessary violence.
2.  **The Reversal of Fortune:** The lion, despite his strength, becomes helpless when trapped by hunters.
3.  **The Reciprocation:** The mouse, despite being small, uses his unique abilities (gnawing) to save the great lion. The mouse explicitly states, ""I have not forgotten the kindness that you showed me!""
4.  **The Lesson:** The core of the fable is that the lion’s small act of kindness toward a seemingly ""useless"" creature eventually saved his own life.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted:** This perfectly captures the theme. The lion's small mercy toward a small creature yielded a life-saving result later.
*   **B) Unequal matches bring misery:** Incorrect; the ""unequal match"" here actually brought salvation and a positive outcome.
*   **C) Cleverness can free the trapped:** While the mouse was clever/skilled, the heart of the story is the *repayment of a favor*, not just the method of escape.
*   **D) Those who act in their own innocent self-interest...:** Incorrect; the mouse was acting out of genuine gratitude, not pretense.
*   **E) Even the smallest actions can awaken great consequences:** While somewhat true (running over the lion's paw), it is too vague and misses the specific virtue of the story (mercy and gratitude).

The most traditional and accurate moral for Aesop's ""The Lion and the Mouse"" is that mercy is rewarded and even the small can help the great.

When they had admitted him into the cote, they found that he made more havoc and slew a l",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the plot step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation:** The Pigeons are afraid of a predator (the Kite). While the Kite is a threat, it is a relatively minor or slow-moving one (it would take a year to do significant damage).
2.  **The Solution:** To solve their problem, the Pigeons invite a more powerful predator (the Hawk) into their home to protect them.
3.  **The Outcome:** The ""protector"" (the Hawk) kills far more Pigeons in a single day than the original enemy would have killed in a year.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Pigeons' attempt to fix their problem resulted in a much more catastrophic disaster. They invited a ""remedy"" that proved far more lethal than the ""disease"" they were trying to cure.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A:** This directly matches the outcome. The Hawk (remedy) was worse than the Kite (disease).
*   **B:** There is no conflict between the wicked here; it is a predator-prey relationship.
*   **C:** While true in a general sense, the focus is specifically on the failure of the chosen solution.
*   **D:** This refers to a different fable (usually ""The Wolf and the Lamb"").
*   **E:** This is a plausible modern interpretation, but traditional Aesop's fables focus on the severity of the outcome relative to the original problem. Option A is the classic, most accurate summary of this specific fable.

At first, the Earth refused to cooperate in Herm",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Directive:** Zeus creates humans and commands they learn to sustain themselves from the Earth (Gaia).
2.  **The Conflict:** Gaia is reluctant to allow humans to dig into her and take what they want.
3.  **The Resolution/Consequence:** Hermes forces Gaia to comply based on Zeus's authority. Gaia agrees, but with a curse: humans may take what they need, but it will come at the cost of labor (""digging""), suffering (""groans""), and sorrow (""tears"").

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) Easy gains often come with hidden costs and hardships.** This aligns with the ending of the fable. While the humans gain the means for survival (food), it is not a ""free gift""; it is a transactional existence defined by hard labor and pain.
*   **B) Do not fight with those who are perfectly capable of fighting back.** While Gaia ""fights back"" with a curse, the core lesson focus is usually on the human condition described in the dialogue.
*   **C) Power can sway the reluctant.** This is a true observation of the interaction between Hermes and Gaia, but Aesopic fables generally focus on the human condition or ethical behavior rather than just the dynamics between gods.
*   **D) Powerful physical stature...** This is unrelated to the text.
*   **E) Guidance is the seed of self-sufficiency.** While Hermes provides guidance, the emphasis of the story’s conclusion is on the ""payment"" (tears and groans) rather than the success of self-sufficiency.

This fable (Aesop 107 in some collections) is traditionally interpreted as an explanation for why life and agriculture require such grueling toil. It emphasizes that basic survival (gains) involves inherent hardship.

The butcher turned around and said to him, 'You haven't stolen my heart; indeed, I have taken heart from this lesson! So if you eve",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Event:** A dog successfully steals a piece of meat (a heart) from a butcher's shop.
2.  **The Butcher's Reaction:** Instead of simply being angry at the loss, the butcher uses the pun ""I have taken heart from this lesson!"" This implies that he has gained wisdom or awareness from the experience.
3.  **The Consequence:** The butcher explicitly warns the dog that because he is now aware of the dog's behavior, he will be prepared to punish the dog if it returns.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A) Experience teaches valuable lessons and encourages caution:** This fits perfectly. The butcher acknowledges that he learned from the theft and will be more cautious/prepared in the future. In many versions of Aesop's fables, this specific story (alternatively titled ""The Butcher and the Dog"") is used to illustrate that ""to be forewarned is to be forearmed"" or that experiential learning leads to better vigilance.
- **B) Nature reveals itself:** While the dog acted according to its nature, the focus of the dialogue is on the butcher's newfound wisdom.
- **C) Boldness without caution leads astray:** This focuses on the dog, but the story's punchline is about the butcher's reaction.
- **D) Better to face a bold, known danger than to trust a deceitful promise of safety:** This is the moral for a different fable (""The Wolf and the Kid"").
- **E) Desire can lead to actions that betray trust:** There was no established trust between the butcher and the stray dog.

The core of the story is the transformation of the butcher from an unaware victim to a vigilant observer through the ""lesson"" of experience.

When he saw a hard-working bull who was pulling a plow, the bullock said to him, 'You poor",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Mockery:** The young bullock, who has lived a life of leisure and ease without ever working, mocks the older bull for his hard labor and heavy burden (the yoke).
2.  **The Reversal:** When the time for sacrifice comes, the hardworking bull is set free to rest in the pasture. Conversely, the bullock—whose idleness served only to keep him fat and ready for slaughter—is led away to be killed.
3.  **The Lesson:** The older bull points out that the bullock's lack of work was not a privilege, but a preparation for a much darker fate. The bullock's initial ""triumph"" or superiority over the laboring bull was premature and misguided.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) He laughs best that laughs last:** This fits the structure of the story. The bullock laughed at the bull's misfortune early on, but the final outcome reversed their roles completely, leaving the bull as the survivor.
*   **B) The great do not always prevail:** This does not fit, as the story is not about ""greatness"" or power struggles, but about the nature of work vs. idleness.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers youthful naivety:** While true in a general sense, the bull does not teach the bullock to be wise; he reveals that the bullock’s naivety led to his doom.
*   **D) He that is neither...:** This is a nonsensical option in the context of the fable.
*   **E) One should not judge others...:** This is a plausible secondary lesson, but the core of the fable (traditionally attributed to Aesop) focuses on the irony of the bullock's early mockery compared to his final fate.

In classical literature and Fable collections, this story (often titled ""The Bull and the Bullock"") is used to illustrate that those who mock the industrious from a position of idle luxury often meet a sudden and unfortunate end. The reversal of fortune makes ""He laughs best that laughs last"" the most accurate thematic fit.

1.  **The Context:** A monkey is saved by a dolphin who mistakes him for a human.
2.  **The Lie:** The monkey pretends to be an Athenian of high status to impress the dolphin.
3.  **The Exposure:** When the dolphin asks about Piraeus (a famous harbor), the monkey mistakenly identifies it as a person he knows well.
4.  **The Consequence:** The dolphin realizes the monkey is a liar and a fraud. Because of this deception, the dolphin stops helping him and drowns him.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The monkey pretended to be something he wasn't (a knowledgeable human) and literally ended up in ""deep water"" (drowned) as a result of his lies.
*   **B:** The story is about deception, not the quality of a crowd versus an individual.
*   **C:** The monkey's plan was to lie, which caused infuriation, it didn't calm it.
*   **D:** While the dolphin was infuriated, the primary lesson is about the danger of the monkey's pretension, not a commentary on the nature of truth itself.
*   **E:** While companionship is present, the ""strength"" is undermined by the monkey's dishonesty, leading to a tragic end rather than a successful one.

The fable serves as a warning against boasting and lying to impress others, as such falsehoods are eventually exposed and lead to ruin.

Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Situation:** The Mice are being hunted by a Cat.
2.  **The Cause of Caution:** After witnessing the Cat eat their companions one by one, the Mice become wary and stay in their holes to survive. They have already learned the danger the Cat poses.
3.  **The Deception:** The Cat attempts to look like something harmless (dead or a meal-bag) to trick them into coming out.
4.  **The Resolution:** The Mice are not fooled. Having been threatened/deceived by the Cat's presence before, they recognize that no matter what form she takes, she is still a danger. One mouse explicitly states that even a transformation won't trick them.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A) He who is once deceived is doubly cautious:** This fits perfectly. The mice, having been previously targeted (deceived by the initial security of the house before the cat arrived), are now so cautious that even a clever disguise cannot lure them out. It reflects the idea that once a victim recognizes a predator's nature, they remain on high alert.
- **B)** There are no ""collaborating"" powerful entities here. 
- **C) Caution tempers cunning:** While the Mice's caution defeats the Cat's cunning, this is a less common phrasing for this specific Aesop's fable. 
- **D)** There are no subordinates involved.
- **E)** While the Cat is an ""opportunistic solution"" to the Mice problem, the story focuses on the Mice's reaction to the Cat, not the homeowner's problem.

In many editions of Aesop's Fables, the moral associated with ""The Cat and the Mice"" is ""The wise are not deceived by the innocent countenance of those they have already found to be dangerous,"" which is most closely summarized by the sentiment in choice A.

1.  **The Situation:** A traveler falls asleep on the ""very brink of a deep well."" This is an act of personal negligence or ""folly.""
2.  **The Intervention:** Dame Fortune wakes him, not out of pure altruism, but to protect her own reputation.
3.  **The Lesson:** Dame Fortune explicitly states that humans often blame ""Fortune"" (luck or fate) for disasters that are actually the result of their own poor decisions or lack of caution. 
4.  **The Conclusion:** The story teaches that individuals are responsible for the outcomes of their actions, and they should not blame fate for self-inflicted misfortunes.

*Analysis of Options:*
*   **A) Everyone is more or less master of his own fate:** This aligns with the idea that our actions (like choosing where to sleep) dictate our outcomes, and we shouldn't blame external luck for our own errors.
*   **B) Every tale is not to be believed:** This is unrelated to the traveler and Fortune.
*   **C) Guard your energy wisely:** While the traveler was tired, the story focuses on the *location* of his rest and the *blame* associated with the outcome, not the management of energy.
*   **D) Relates to strife and conflict:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) Exhaustion can lead to perilous oversight:** While true in a literal sense, it misses the thematic point regarding ""Fortune"" and ""Blame"" which the dialogue emphasizes.

3.  **The Betrayal:** Once the man has a complete tool, he immediately uses that tool to destroy the very source that helped him.
4.  **The Realization:** The oak tree realizes that by providing the man with the means to harm them, the trees have brought about their own destruction.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) You should think twice before offering anything to your enemies:** This captures the essence of providing a ""handle"" (a means or advantage) to someone who may use it against you.
*   **B) It is better to be injured with impunity...:** This is a variation of a moral from a different fable (The Eagle and the Fox) and doesn't fit the specific logic of the trees' self-inflicted harm.
*   **C) Generosity without wisdom invites regret:** This is a strong candidate, as the trees were generous but unwise.
*   **D) What we are silently forced to do...:** This doesn't fit because the trees chose to give the handle; they weren't forced.
*   **E) A stubborn quest...:** This does not relate to the theme of self-sabotage or betrayal.

While ""C"" is a good general lesson, the specific point of this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Woodcutter and the Trees"") is that one should not provide the very tools or means of one's own destruction to a potential adversary. Option A most directly addresses the relationship between the trees (the victims) and the man (the enemy/destroyer). In classic translations of this fable, the moral is centered on the folly of helping those who will use that help to hurt you.

morables_527,"The crab's mother said to him, 'My son, why do you walk in a crooked line when you should be walking straight ahead?' The crab said to her, 'O mother, lead the way, and I will try to walk accordingly.",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s break down the story:

1.  **The Action:** A mother crab criticizes her son for walking sideways (crookedly) and instructs him to walk straight.
2.  **The Response:** The son asks his mother to demonstrate the correct way so that he may follow her example.
3.  **The Outcome:** The mother is physically unable to walk straight herself.
4.  **The Lesson:** One should not criticize others for a behavior that they themselves cannot or do not perform. Teaching by ""precept"" (giving instructions or rules) is ineffective if the teacher cannot provide a practical ""example.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Example is more powerful than precept:** This perfectly matches the narrative. The mother's words (precept) are useless because her actions (example) contradict them/cannot support them.
*   **B) Contentment with our lot...:** This story isn't about happiness or being satisfied with one's station; it's about instruction and hypocrisy.
*   **C) Those who cannot see the path...:** While the mother is trying to guide, the core of the story is about the physical ability to lead by example rather than ""sight.""
*   **D) Hypocritical equals...:** While hypocrisy is involved, ""equals"" and ""friends"" doesn't fit the parent-child dynamic described.
*   **E) Even the crooked can find their way...:** This is the opposite of what happens; the mother fails to provide the guidance, proving that the guidance was impossible to begin with.

The most traditional and accurate moral for this Aesop's fable is that one should lead by example.

1.  **The Characters:** Both the wolf and the fox are traditional archetypes for thieves or tricksters in fables. The wolf has a ""store of booty"" (stolen goods), and the fox attempts to manipulate him to get a share.
2.  **The Conflict:** The wolf is spiteful and refuses to share his stolen goods. The fox, feeling Slighted, betrays the wolf to the shepherd.
3.  **The Resolution:** The wolf is killed for his thefts. The fox, who benefited from the wolf's death by eating his ""larder,"" is eventually caught by hunters and killed.
4.  **The Realization:** As the fox dies, she realizes her fate is a direct result of her ""serious crime"" and for bringing about ""someone else's death.""

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **B, C, D, and E:** These focus on parts of the interaction (spite, cunning, or trust) but miss the ultimate conclusion of the story. 
*   **A: Take pleasure when thieves destroy themselves.** This is a classic moral often attached to this specific Aesop's fable (and similar ones). The story depicts two ""thieves"" (the wolf who stole the flock and the fox who betrayed for gain) who ultimately bring about each other's destruction. The fox facilitates the wolf's death, and her own ""crime"" leads to her own demise. The reader or observer is meant to see the justice in two bad actors eliminating one another.

morables_91,An Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it. But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; ,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the character interactions:

1.  **Initial Conflict:** An Eagle attacks a Serpent; they engage in a life-and-death struggle.
2.  **Act of Kindness:** A countryman intervenes to save the Eagle, freeing it from the Serpent's coils.
3.  **Act of Malice:** The Serpent retaliates by poisoning the countryman's drink.
4.  **Reciprocal Act of Kindness:** The Eagle, recognizing that the man saved its life, intervenes to save the man from the poison by knocking the horn from his hand.

The story highlights a cycle of gratitude. The man performed a ""good turn"" for the Eagle, and the Eagle repaid the favor by saving the man's life in return. While the Serpent represents vengeance, the ultimate resolution of the story focuses on the Eagle's gratitude toward its savior.

- **Option A** (One good turn deserves another) directly mirrors this cycle of reciprocal kindness.
- **Option B** refers to greed, which is not present here.
- **Option C** and **Option D** focus on the Serpent's vengeance, but ignore the Eagle's saving grace, which is the climax of the story.
- **Option E** is a general observation but not the primary lesson of the interaction.

In the tradition of Aesop's Fables, this story (often titled ""The Eagle and the Serpent"") is the classic illustration of gratitude and mutual aid.

His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, My master gives a feast, a",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this fable (often attributed to Aesop and known as ""The Dog and the Cook""), let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Invitation:** A guest dog is invited to a feast by another dog, not by the host (the Rich Man). This makes the guest dog an intruder or an uninvited visitor entering through unofficial channels.
2.  **The Expectation:** The guest dog anticipates a grand meal he hasn't earned or been formally invited to, focusing on his own greed (""eat enough to last me both today and tomorrow"").
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he has no legitimate right to be there, the Cook (the authority in the kitchen) treats him like a nuisance rather than a guest, physically throwing him out the window.
4.  **The Aftermath:** The dog lies to his peers to hide his shame, but the physical reality remains: he was forcibly ejected because he entered a place where he didn't belong.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **B, C, and E** do not fit the narrative of punishment and intrusion.
*   **D** refers to ""deceitful promises of safety,"" which doesn't quite match because the first dog meant well; the issue was the lack of legitimate status.
*   **A** uses the metaphor of ""entering by the back stairs"" (coming in through unofficial or unauthorized means). If you enter a house uninvited or through the ""back way,"" you should not be surprised when you are discarded or thrown out ""at the window."" This matches the dog's experience exactly.

The story teaches that those who take advantage of situations where they have no rightful place should expect to be treated with contempt and ejected.

He ordered that the bag of coins be brought to him as he was dying and then asked",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the key elements:

1.  **The Nature of the Wealth:** The man is described as ""miserly"" and his wealth as ""ill-gotten"" (acquired through dishonest or immoral means).
2.  **The Toil vs. The Result:** The man ""sweated"" over the coins, but the coins explain that this effort was for nothing: the heirs will squander the money on vices (women and drinks).
3.  **The Spiritual Consequence:** Because of how the money was acquired and kept, the man faces ""eternal torments"" from demons.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) A life of greed and hoarding wealth leads to misery:** While partially true, the story focuses specifically on the *source* of the wealth (ill-gotten) and the specific *spiritual* consequence mentioned at the end.
*   **B) One chief vs. many:** This is irrelevant to the story.
*   **C) Ill-gotten gains bring eternal torment:** This directly addresses the two main outcomes mentioned by the bag: the money is ""ill-gotten"" and the soul faces ""eternal torments."" It captures the specific warning of the fable.
*   **D) Unfamiliar things appearing tormenting:** This is a moral for a different type of fable (like ""The Fox and the Lion"").
*   **E) Fruits of toil may not yield intended legacy:** This is true, but it misses the ethical/spiritual warning about the ""ill-gotten"" nature of the wealth which is central to the dialogue with the demons.

The most precise moral, particularly in the context of traditional fables where ""ill-gotten"" wealth is a central theme, is that dishonest gains lead to spiritual ruin and the wasteful enjoyment of those gains by others.

The city mouse finished his business in the country and by means of insistent inv,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Setup:** The story contrasts two lifestyles: the country mouse's ""humble meal of acorns"" and the city mouse's ""various delicacies."" 
2.  **The Conflict:** Despite the abundance of food in the city, there is a constant threat of danger (the butler/humans). The city mouse is at home in this danger, but the country mouse is terrified and ""frightened out of his wits.""
3.  **The Resolution:** The city mouse values the high quality of the food (""delicious food... anywhere else in the world""), while the country mouse realizes he prefers his simple life because it is safe and free from fear.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The country mouse chooses ""acorns"" over ""delicacies"" specifically because the acorns come with security and peace of mind (""so long as I am secure in my freedom"").

Comparing this to the choices:
*   **A) It is better to live in self-sufficient poverty than to be tormented by the worries of wealth:** This directly reflects the mouse's choice of humble acorns/security over abundant delicacies/danger.
*   **B) Consider the consequences of your actions:** This is too broad and relates more to a story about a specific mistake or foresight.
*   **C) Familiarity can ease the unfamiliar:** While the city mouse was less afraid because he knew the hole, the story's climax is about the choice between types of life, not just adaptability.
*   **D) Save a familiar Thief...:** This is a moral for a different fable (The Thief and the Hangman) and has no relevance here.
*   **E) A persuasive invitation...:** This describes the plot of the story but fails to capture the underlying lesson or moral.

The story teaches that luxury is not worth the price of constant fear and anxiety.

The beetle then felt contem",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative arc and the beetle’s internal journey:

1.  **Preparation and Hubris:** The beetle begins sated but becomes dissatisfied after comparing himself to a superior creature (the eagle). He expresses contempt for his own nature and peers, claiming equality in beauty (""sheen"") and voice, and decides to abandon his ""lowly"" station for a ""lofty"" one.
2.  **The Failure:** The beetle attempts to mimic the eagle. However, his physical limitations (his ""song"" is just buzzing and his strength cannot withstand the wind) lead to failure. He is removed from his safe environment and faces exhaustion and starvation.
3.  **The Realization:** At the end, the beetle regrets his ambition and values his original life (""dung heap"") over the status he once craved. He realizes that trying to be something he is not has left him worse off than before.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** Matches the story perfectly. The beetle was ""arrogant"" in thinking he was equal to the eagle, ""put on airs"" by trying to join bird society, failed to achieve the new status, and ended up losing his former comfort (his home and food).
*   **B:** Incorrect. The beetle does not seek revenge; he seeks status.
*   **C:** Incorrect. The story is a cautionary tale against leaving one's sphere, not an endorsement of diversity.
*   **D:** Incorrect. This is a quote from Marlowe regarding action over words, but the beetle never delivers ""strong blows""; he simply falls.
*   **E:** Incorrect. While the beetle experiences wonder, the story emphasizes the disaster that follows his attempt to act on it, rather than the inspiration itself.

The fable teaches that one should be content with their nature and that overreaching pride leads to the loss of what one already has.

I can't decide what to do: my love of money and my innat",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** The protagonist discovers a valuable object (a lion made of gold). He is immediately paralyzed by a conflict between his **greed** (desire for the gold) and his **cowardice** (fear of the lion's form).
2.  **The Absurdity:** The protagonist recognizes that the object is an ""accident or supernatural power""—it is inanimate gold—yet his irrational fear prevents him from simply picking it up. He laments that the gift is ""unwelcome"" because he cannot bring himself to touch it.
3.  **The Resolution:** Instead of overcoming his fear to claim the treasure, he decides to stay at a distance and send others to do the work. 
4.  **The Core Lesson:** The story highlights that for a person governed by fear, even the greatest fortune is useless. The protagonist ""longs for the gold but fears the object,"" rendering the treasure a ""satisfaction"" he cannot actually enjoy. 

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **B, C, D, and E:** While elements of greed and indecision are present, they do not capture the central irony of the story.
*   **A:** This option directly addresses the protagonist's plight: he has found immense wealth, but his character (cowardice) makes that wealth inaccessible and of no practical value to him.

The fable teaches that internal flaws (like cowardice) can prevent a person from benefiting from external good fortune.

When opinions were exchanged back and forth, the ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the characters:

1.  **The Context:** The beasts hold an assembly to resolve grievances. The hares (the physically weak) propose a system of total equality and shared dignity so that the strong cannot prey upon the weak.
2.  **The Argument:** The hares argue for a moral/legal framework where power is equalized regardless of physical nature.
3.  **The Response:** The lions (the physically strong) do not argue against the ""goodness"" of the hares' words; rather, they point out a physical reality. The hares lack the ""claws and teeth"" (the power or means of enforcement) to back up their demand for equality.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that lofty ideals, rights, or legal arguments are often ineffective if those proposing them lack the power to enforce or defend them. In a world governed by strength, a position or a demand for change requires more than just ""good words""—it requires the means to protect that position.

*   **A) Be prepared to defend your position:** This aligns with the lions' retort. The hares have a position, but no way to defend or enforce it against those with superior power.
*   **B)** relates to Aesop's *The Lion and the Mouse*, not this story. 
*   **C)** and **D)** are idealistic interpretations that the text actually subverts (the lions dismiss fairness in favor of physical power). 
*   **E)** focuses on the assembly itself, whereas the ""punchline"" of the fable is the lions' dismissal of the hares' weakness.

The core lesson is that arguments for equality or justice are often ignored by the powerful if the speaker lacks the strength to back them up.

There was a whole crowd of monkeys there and one of them ,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the character motivations:

1.  **The Setting:** The men are in a land ruled by an animal (the monkey) who is mimicking human power structures (the Emperor). This establishes an environment based on a false premise or vanity.
2.  **The Liar:** He recognizes the leader's desire for status and feeds that vanity with flattery. He is rewarded because his lies validate the leader's delusions.
3.  **The Truth-Teller:** He assumes that truth is objectively more valuable than lies and will be rewarded regardless of the situation. He fails to realize he is in an environment that thrives on deception.
4.  **The Outcome:** The leader, insulted by the reality of his own nature (""You are simply a monkey""), reacts with violence. The truth-teller is punished specifically because his honesty exposed the deception the leader was trying to maintain.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** This fits best. The monkeys (who thrive on the deception of being an imperial court) retaliate against the truth-teller because his honesty threatens their vanity.
*   **B:** While true in life, the story focuses more on the *reaction* to truth versus lies rather than the difficulty of knowing a person.
*   **C:** Flattery does deceive the naive, but this option focuses only on the liar’s success and ignores the tragic fate of the truth-teller, which is the ""sting"" of the fable.
*   **D:** This is a moral associated with other Aesop fables (like ""The Fox and the Lion""), but it doesn't apply here. 
*   **E:** The story proves the opposite—truth was not a defense; it was the cause of the man's injury.

**Conclusion:**
The fable warns that in places where vanity and lies are the standard, the truth is not welcomed and can actually be dangerous to the speaker.

This slave-woman, bedecked with gold and trailing a delicate purple robe aro",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** A man is obsessed with a woman who is explicitly described as ""ugly"" and ""wicked."" Despite these traits, he treats her with immense generosity and elevates her status.
2.  **The Woman's Action:** She believes her success is due to her own beauty or the favor of Aphrodite (the goddess of beauty). She constantly thanks the goddess for her ""beauty"" and good fortune.
3.  **The Interaction with the Goddess:** Aphrodite appears and explicitly clarifies that she did *not* make the woman beautiful. In fact, the goddess expresses disgust and fury that the man finds such an ""ugly"" person attractive. 
4.  **The Lesson:** The takeaway is that the man's attraction is irrational and not divinely inspired; it is a form of madness or delusion. In the context of Aesop's fables (where this story originates), the ""blindness"" of the man to the woman's true nature and appearance is viewed as a sign of mental imbalance or divine displeasure.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A** reflects the classical interpretation: The man’s attraction to ""ugly things"" is seen as a sign that he is out of his mind.
- **B** is incorrect because there is no mention of a conscience.
- **C** is incorrect because the man's generosity is portrayed as misplaced, not redemptive.
- **D** is incorrect as the woman is not ""beautiful.""
- **E** is a modern sentiment, but it contradicts the goddess's statement, as she explicitly maintains that the woman is ugly and doesn't deserve the man's attention.

morables_134,A father had an unmanageable son who indulged his vicious adolescent temper by brutally whipping the slaves whenever his father wasn't looking. Aesop therefore shared this little story with the father,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the fable:

1.  **The Situation:** A father has a son who is aggressive and cruel (""vicious adolescent temper"").
2.  **The Metaphor:** A farmer pairs an ""old bull"" (representing experience, age, and moderation) with a ""young bull"" (representing reckless aggression and strength).
3.  **The Purpose:** The farmer explains that the old bull isn't there to pull the heavy load, but to ""keep the young bull in check"" and restrain his kicking and butting.
4.  **The Application:** Aesop tells the father to keep the boy beside him so that the father's ""moderation"" can restrain the boy's ""reckless inclinations.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) A mild disposition can put a stop to vicious behaviour:** This is a strong candidate. The story explicitly mentions using the father's ""moderation"" (a mild disposition) to restrain ""vicious"" behavior.
*   **B) Do not mock the feelings of old age...:** This is irrelevant to the plot of the story.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers reckless aggression:** This is the most accurate summary. The ""old bull"" and the ""father"" represent the wisdom and moderation that comes with age/experience, which acts as a tempering force against the ""young bull"" and the ""son's"" reckless aggression.
*   **D) Slow and wise steady wins the race:** This is the moral of *The Tortoise and the Hare*, not this story.
*   **E) Unchecked behavior in youth can lead to greater harm:** While the story warns that the household will suffer if the boy isn't restrained, the *primary* lesson is about the specific method of restraint: using the wise/mature to guide the reckless/immature.

While A and C are similar, **C** captures the essence of using ""wisdom"" (the old bull/father) to ""temper"" (restrain/moderate) ""reckless aggression"" (the young bull/son). However, looking at the phrasing of the text (""restrain his reckless inclinations with your own moderation""), it emphasizes that the presence of a calm, mature force acts as a corrective measure. 

In many classical interpretations of this specific Aesop fable, the moral is categorized as age and wisdom acting as a harness for the impulses of youth.

All the other passengers started to swim, but the Athenian kept praying to Athena, maki",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A ship capsizes in a storm. The passengers are in a life-or-death situation where survival depends on physical action (swimming).
2.  **The Contrast:** The wealthy Athenian relies solely on divine intervention, praying and making promises to the goddess Athena instead of taking action. The other passengers, however, are actively swimming to save themselves.
3.  **The Climax/Advice:** A fellow passenger points out the flaw in the Athenian’s logic: while he seeks help from the divine, he must also use his own physical strength.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story (traditionally known as ""The Shipwrecked Athenian"" or associated with the proverb ""God helps those who help themselves"") teaches that faith or reliance on others is no substitute for personal initiative and hard work. Divine help—or luck—is best applied to those who are already trying their hardest.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Self-effort is essential:** This directly matches the message that one must ""move their arms"" (take action) alongside their prayers.
*   **B) A learned man has always a fund of riches in himself:** This is a moral for a different fable (often ""The Boatman and the Scholar"" or similar).
*   **C) True power lies in practicality:** While related, ""Self-effort"" is the specific traditional lesson of this Aesop fable.
*   **D) Powerful opposites are utterly divine and incompatible:** This does not fit the context of the story.
*   **E) True character is revealed when the tides turn:** While true, it is not the central lesson regarding the necessity of action.

morables_607,"A Frog and a Mouse, who had long been rivals for the sovereignty of a certain marsh, and had many a skirmish and running fight together, agreed one day to settle the matter, once for all, by a fair an",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the central conflict.

1.  **The Situation:** Two rivals (the Frog and the Mouse) are so focused on their internal conflict over territory (""sovereignty of a certain marsh"") that they commit to a fight to the death.
2.  **The Distraction:** They are entirely preoccupied with their spears and the combat itself. They are not paying attention to their surroundings.
3.  **The Outcome:** A third party (the Kite) observes them from afar. Because they are distracted by their fighting, they are easy targets. The ""prize"" (the lives of the combatants or the control of the territory) is effectively taken away by a bystander who was not part of the initial dispute.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) When fools fight others run away with the prize.** This is the classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable. The ""fools"" are the Frog and Mouse, and the Kite is the one who benefits from their dispute.
*   **B) People who do harm to others destroy themselves in the bargain.** While they are destroyed, the focus is more on the external intervention rather than self-inflicted harm through the act of fighting itself.
*   **C) Stay vigilant against hidden threats.** This is a plausible lesson, but ""vigilance"" is a secondary theme to the folly of the fight itself.
*   **D) Be observant before you make a predatory leap.** This applies to the Kite, but the moral of a fable usually applies to the protagonists' mistakes.
*   **E) Rivalries can blind us to the greater dangers lurking nearby.** This is also a very strong interpretation of the story’s events.

In the context of traditional Aesop's fables, the most recognized moral for ""The Frog and the Mouse"" (or ""The Mouse and the Frog"") is that when two parties fight over a dispute, a third party often steps in to take advantage of their exhaustion or distraction. Option A most accurately captures the ""third party beneficiary"" aspect of the fable.

morables_577,"A woman who had two daughters buried one of them, and mourners were provided to attend the funeral. The surviving daughter wondered to see strangers so much concerned at the loss of her sister, and he",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation**: A mother has lost a daughter. She hires ""mourners"" (professionals) to attend the funeral.
2.  **The Observation**: The surviving daughter notices that these strangers are crying and displaying more outward grief than the actual family members.
3.  **The Explanation**: The mother explains that the family gains nothing from the act of crying (their grief is internal and practical), whereas the strangers are crying specifically because they are being paid to do so.
4.  **The Lesson**: The story highlights the transactional nature of certain behaviors. The ""grief"" shown by the strangers is not genuine emotion; it is a professional service. 

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Professional mourners serve those who pay the most** – This directly reflects the mother’s explanation that the strangers ""have money for it."" It points to the idea that outward displays of ""virtue"" or ""emotion"" are often bought and sold. (Commonly associated versions of this Aesop fable carry the moral: ""The hired mourner makes the most noise."")
*   **B), C), D), and E)** – These options either address themes not present in the text (like curiosity's effect on integrity) or misinterpret the professional mourners' financial motivation as genuine shared sorrow.

Option A is the most accurate reflection of the text's cynical observation regarding paid service versus genuine feeling.

'And for what cause,' he asked, 'have y",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Characters:** A traveler meets a personification of ""Truth"" in the desert.
2.  **The Context:** Truth is living in the wilderness, away from human society, and is described as ""terribly dejected.""
3.  **The Reason:** When asked why she is in the desert rather than the city, Truth explains that in the past, lies were rare (""found among only a few""), but now they have ""spread throughout all of human society.""
4.  **The Core Lesson:** The fable emphasizes the ubiquity of dishonesty in the modern world. Truth cannot reside in the city because society is now saturated with falsehoods.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Falsehood is with all men:** This directly reflects Truth's statement that lies have spread through ""all of human society.""
*   **B) He who claims any good...:** This is a moral typically associated with fables about pride or divinity, not applicable here.
*   **C) Curiosity uncovers hidden truths:** While the traveler is curious, the focus of the story is Truth's exile due to widespread lying, not the act of discovery itself.
*   **D) Even beneficial things...:** This is the moral of a different Aesop fable (The Camel).
*   **E) Compassion can be a guiding light...:** The traveler is inquisitive, but the story ends with a pessimistic social commentary rather than a lesson on compassion.

The story highlights the prevalence of lying in the world, making the most accurate moral that falsehood is now found everywhere among people.

As the ox stru",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Situation:** Two animals (a donkey and an ox) are tasked with sharing a burden.
2.  **The Conflict:** The donkey refuses to help, forcing the ox to exert excessive effort.
3.  **The Consequence (Initial):** The ox dies from the strain.
4.  **The Consequence (Final):** Because the ox is no longer there to carry the load, the donkey must carry not only the original load but also the heavy carcass of the ox. This leads to the donkey’s own death.
5.  **The Lesson:** The birds explicitly state that if the donkey had helped his neighbor (the ox), he would have avoided the disastrous outcome where the neighbor's burden (and the neighbor himself) became his sole responsibility.

**Evaluation of choices:**
*   **A)** Directly addresses the ""neighbor"" dynamic and the transfer of the burden.
*   **B)** This is a general observation about outcomes but doesn't capture the specific lesson of shared responsibility.
*   **C)** Hard work did not triumph in this story; both characters died.
*   **D)** While partially true, it doesn't emphasize the moral choice of helping others.
*   **E)** Perseverance led to the ox's death; the story is more a warning against selfishness than a tribute to strength.

Choice **A** is the classic moral of this Aesop-style fable, emphasizing that selfishness in a partnership often leads to the downfall of the shirker.

1.  **The Context:** The fable explains that because of haste in creation, ""modesty"" was not built into man's original nature.
2.  **The Action:** Jupiter introduces modesty to humanity later as an external influence/entity rather than an internal component.
3.  **The Conflict/Condition:** Modesty agrees to exist among humanity under one specific condition: she refuses to coexist with ""carnal love."" 
4.  **The Result:** The text explicitly states that ""wherever that [carnal love] comes, says she, I'm gone.""

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) Modesty and carnal love cannot survive together:** This directly reflects the final sentence of the fable, which establishes the mutual exclusivity of these two forces.
*   **B), C), and E):** While haste is mentioned at the beginning, the primary ""lesson"" or ""observation"" of the fable focuses on the behavioral relationship between modesty and desire, not a general warning about haste or virtues.
*   **D):** This is irrelevant to the text provided.

The core lesson provided by the fable's conclusion is that modesty and carnal desire are incompatible; when one enters, the other departs.

The fox then said to ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this fable (often attributed to Aesop), let’s analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Setting:** The characters are in a cemetery, a place filled with the dead who cannot speak or act.
2.  **The Action:** The monkey takes advantage of this specific setting to claim that the prestigious people buried there were his ancestors' servants. He chooses this location precisely because there is no one alive to prove him wrong.
3.  **The Reaction:** The fox points out the irony: the monkey is only being so bold because his ""witnesses"" are dead and incapable of refuting his claims.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **B** and **E** are irrelevant to the core interaction regarding the cemetery.
*   **C** and **D** touch on deception and cunning generally, but they don't capture the specific mechanism of the lie told in the story.
*   **A** directly addresses the specific nature of the monkey's lie: he is exploiting the fact that the subjects of his story (the dead) are unable to challenge his falsehoods.

The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural i",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A Farmer shows compassion and kindness to a creature in distress (a frozen Snake), going so far as to use his own body heat to save it.
2.  **The Reaction:** Once revived, the Snake does not show gratitude; instead, it follows its ""natural instincts"" and bites the person who saved it.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Farmer dies. His final realization is that he was wrong to expect a ""scoundrel"" (an entity with a naturally harmful or ungrateful nature) to change its behavior because of his kindness.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.** This aligns perfectly with the story. No matter how great the Farmer's kindness was (saving the Snake's life), it could not change the Snake's nature or make it feel obligated to be kind in return.
*   **B) The man who treats others well is rewarded by gratitude.** The story explicitly contradicts this; the Farmer is rewarded with a mortal wound.
*   **C) Gratitude prevents regret.** There is no gratitude in the story, only regret from the Farmer for his misplaced pity.
*   **D) Injuries may be regretfully forgiven, but not ungratefully forgotten.** This is a complex sentiment that doesn't fit the clear-cut ""kindness vs. nature"" theme of the fable.
*   **E) Even in the coldest times, a touch of compassion can revive what seems lost.** While literally true in the story, this is not a ""moral"" (a lesson on how to behave). The story serves as a warning *against* reviving the ""snake.""

The classic moral of Aesop's fable ""The Farmer and the Viper"" is that kindness shown to evil or ungrateful people is often repaid with injury.

When the blacksmiths were working, the dog would go to sleep, but when they sat down to a meal he would wake up and approach his masters in a f",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the relationship between the dog's behavior and the blacksmiths' observation:

1.  **The Context:** The dog is surrounded by loud, productive work (the hammers hitting the anvil). This noise is vital to the household's livelihood, but it provides no immediate, personal gain to the dog, so the dog ignores it and sleeps.
2.  **The Trigger:** The dog wakes up only when the sound of eating begins. This sound indicates a direct personal benefit (food).
3.  **The Blacksmiths' Question:** They point out the hypocrisy of the dog's selective hearing—ignoring the ""heavy"" work but noticing the ""slightest"" sound of something that benefits him.
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A** directly addresses this selective attention based on self-interest. It captures the essence of someone (or a dog) ignoring hard work or general noise but becoming instantly alert when their own needs or benefits are involved.
    *   **B** relates to agency and proxy actions, which is not present here.
    *   **C** is a general proverb, but the story is more about selective perception than a competition between diligence and opportunism. 
    *   **D** refers to ""The Wolf and the Lamb,"" where a tyrant justifies their actions via excuses; there is no tyrant here.
    *   **E** misinterprets the dog's behavior as ""adaptation"" rather than self-interest.

The fable (attributed to Aesop) is intended to criticize those who are lazy when it comes to chores or duties but are instantly ready to participate when it is time to consume or benefit.

He greeted the unicorn and said to him, 'Let us put aside all that we have done in the past, because I am no ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the dialogue:

1.  **The Context:** The lion and the unicorn are established as ""chief enemies.""
2.  **The Deception:** The lion uses a facade of weakness, sickness, and old age to lower the unicorn's guard. He specifically targets the unicorn's primary means of defense—his horn.
3.  **The Mistake:** Despite their history, the unicorn pities the lion, believes his promise, and renders himself ""defenceless"" by giving away his horn.
4.  **The Result:** The lion immediately betrays the unicorn. 
5.  **The Debate:** The unicorn argues that treachery and guile negate the honor of a victory. The lion argues that mercy toward an enemy is a weakness that endangers one's own life.

While the unicorn gets the ""last word"" regarding honor, the actual lesson of the narrative arc (the cautionary tale) focuses on the danger of trusting a sworn enemy who appears vulnerable. 

*   **Option A** directly addresses the core mistake of the unicorn: trusting an enemy who comes ""humble and supplicating.""
*   **Option E** reflects the unicorn's perspective in the final retort, but many fables serve as a warning against the specific folly committed by the victim. In Aesopic tradition, the primary lesson is usually the danger of being deceived by those who wish you ill.

The lion’s success was only possible because the unicorn ignored the reality of their enmity in favor of a plea for pity. Therefore, the most comprehensive moral regarding the behavior of both characters—and the one that serves as a warning to the reader—is that one should never trust an enemy, regardless of how humble they appear.

But being the ruler of the freshwater wasn't enough for him; he wanted to rule the sea too. With t",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **Preparation/Context:** The Master-Pike is already a ""Prince"" in his own domain (the river), possessing size, beauty, and strength.
2.  **The Conflict:** He is not satisfied with his status and seeks to expand his rule to a territory where he does not belong (the sea).
3.  **The Consequence:** He encounters a much stronger force (the Dolphin) that exists naturally in that environment. He is humbled and nearly loses his life.
4.  **The Resolution:** He returns to his original domain and stays there, having learned to be satisfied with his original position.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Be content with your lot:** This fits perfectly. The Pike had everything he needed in the river but risked it all due to greed/ambition for more. His final wisdom is staying within his own territory.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you...:** The story doesn't focus on the opinions of others, but rather the physical reality of power dynamics.
*   **C) Strength without humility...:** While true in a general sense, the Pike *was* strong; he simply wasn't the strongest in the ocean. The focus is more on boundaries and contentment.
*   **D) Ambitious counsel without mighty help...:** The Pike acted on his own ambition, not counsel from others.
*   **E) True leadership...:** The story doesn't focus on how he led his subjects, but rather his personal desire for expansion.

As soon as the ro,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the central conflict.

1. **The Conflict:** Two soldiers are attacked. One flees (cowardice), while the other stays and fights the robber alone (bravery).
2. **The Reaction:** Once the danger has passed, the coward returns, brandishing his sword and making aggressive threats against the already-defeated robber.
3. **The Lesson:** The brave soldier rebukes him, pointing out that his words and weapons are ""useless"" now because his actions during the moment of danger proved his lack of courage. He emphasizes that while the coward's words might fool strangers, those who have seen him ""turn tail and run"" know his courage is unreliable.

Now let's evaluate the options:
- **A) Courage in words means nothing if you flee in danger:** This directly addresses the contrast between the coward's boastful words after the fight and his flight during the fight.
- **B) Risk in being poor/rich:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
- **C) Bravery outshines cowardice:** While true, it is too general and doesn't capture the specific irony of the coward's empty boasting.
- **D) Know your enemies:** The story is more about the unreliability of a ""friend"" or ""comrade"" than about the robber (the enemy).
- **E) Courage in adversity reveals true character:** This is a very strong candidate, but the fable emphasizes the specific hypocrisy of the coward's *speech* following his flight.

In the tradition of Aesop’s fables (where this story originates), the moral specifically targets those who are ""braggarts in peace, but cowards in war."" The brave soldier's primary complaint is the disconnect between the coward's current threats and his previous desertion. This makes **A** the most precise fit for the soldier's dialogue.

1.  **The Situation:** The Eagle (the leader/king of birds) gives the Hoopoe a high seat of honor at a wedding.
2.  **The Reason for Honor:** The Hoopoe is chosen because of its outward appearance—specifically its impressive crest (""crown"") and beautiful, multicolored feathers.
3.  **The Reality/Character of the Subject:** Despite looking regal, the Hoopoe’s actual behavior and nature are ignoble; it spends its time rolling in ""dung and filth.""
4.  **The Reaction:** The other birds resent this because the honor is misplaced.

**Analysis of the Lessons:**
*   **A) True worth should be measured by character and deeds, not by outward appearances:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The Eagle made the mistake of honoring the Hoopoe based on its ""crown"" and ""feathers"" (outward appearance) while ignoring its filthy habits (character/deeds).
*   **B) Protagonist/Revenge:** This is the moral of ""The Eagle and the Beetle,"" which is a different fable. There is no revenge plot here.
*   **C) Resentment:** While the birds are resentful, the story focuses on the *cause* of that resentment—the superficial judgment of the Eagle.
*   **D) Kindness:** The story is not about a specific act of kindness being rewarded.
*   **E) Inclusivity:** The story actually highlights a failure in judgment within a group, rather than the benefits of inclusion.

The fable serves as a warning against being deceived by ""fine feathers"" or status symbols when the individual’s underlying nature is base.

1.  **The Action:** A hen finds snake eggs and treats them as her own, nurturing and brooding over them. This represents an act of kindness or nurturance toward something inherently dangerous.
2.  **The Warning:** A swallow observes this and calls the hen ""stupid"" and ""senseless.""
3.  **The Consequence:** The swallow predicts that once the snakes hatch, they will destroy the hen (their caretaker) first, and then everyone else.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates that the nature of a ""wicked"" or dangerous creature does not change simply because you treat it with kindness. Nurturing a threat only allows that threat to grow until it eventually harms its benefactor. 

Evaluating the options:
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the story. The ""wicked man"" (the snake) is dangerous regardless of how innocuous the eggs seem or how much care is given to them.
*   **B)** This refers to greed, which is not present here.
*   **C)** The story suggests the opposite: devotion invites danger in this context.
*   **D)** There is no competition with ""superiors"" in this story.

1.  **The Situation:** The jackdaw is captured and kept as a pet (a ""slave in human society""). While his freedom is restricted, he is physically safe.
2.  **The Action:** Seeking absolute freedom, he escapes at the first opportunity.
3.  **The Consequence:** In his haste to return to his old life, the very tether used to keep him in captivity becomes his death trap when it entangles in the branches of his home.
4.  **The Realization:** The jackdaw blames himself and his own ""stupidity"" (his state of mind/impatience) for his demise. He recognizes that by seeking to escape a safe—albeit restricted—condition, he created a fatal one.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) It is not the place, nor the condition, but the mind alone that is responsible for our happiness.** This aligns with the jackdaw's final lament. He was safe in ""human society,"" but his mind could not accept it, leading to a reckless escape that caused his death.

*   **E) Possession without freedom is a gift unappreciated.** While this describes the children's perspective or the bird's initial state, it does not capture the tragic irony of the bird’s death, which is the focus of the final monologue.

The fable highlights that the bird's internal discontent with his ""condition"" led to a situation far worse than the one he fled. Therefore, the lesson focuses on the internal state and the consequences of one's choices driven by that state.

1.  **The Conflict:** A group of sailors is in a life-threatening situation (a storm) and is attempting to seek help through intermediaries (various saints).
2.  **The Observation:** One sailor realizes that using intermediaries is time-consuming and risks failure if the ""message"" isn't delivered fast enough before they drown.
3.  **The Solution:** He suggests bypassing the middleman and going directly to the source of power (God) to save time and ensure the request is heard immediately.

*   **B) It is better to be loved than feared:** This relates to leadership styles and is not addressed in the story.
*   **C) Mercy tempers power:** While the storm stops, the focus of the fable is on the *method* of the prayer rather than the quality of mercy.
*   **D) Not all pragmatic advice is diverse or wise:** The sailor's advice was actually both pragmatic and wise, contradicting this statement.
*   **E) Urgency in communication is vital:** While communication was urgent, the lesson emphasizes the *efficiency of the route* (directness) rather than just the speed of talking.

The fable teaches that when faced with a crisis, it is most effective to deal with the primary source of power directly rather than wasting time with intermediaries. This is summarized in option A.

morables_444,"A snake and a weasel were fighting with one another inside a house. The mice who lived in the house were always being hunted down by either the snake or the weasel, so when they saw the snake and the ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the behavior of the characters:

1.  **The Conflict:** Two powerful predators (the snake and the weasel) are fighting.
2.  **The Bystanders:** The mice, who are the natural prey of both, see the combatants distracted. They believe they are safe or can take advantage of the chaos, so they leave their protective holes.
3.  **The Resolution:** The predators realize there is an easy common target. They put aside their mutual conflict to prey upon the smaller, vulnerable parties who exposed themselves.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A)** This is a strong fit. The mice (bystanders) suffer because they get caught in the middle or miscalculate the danger of a conflict between more powerful entities.
*   **B)** While the mice were deceived by the ""appearance"" of safety, this is too general.
*   **C)** The mice were not timid; they were reckless, and they did not outwit anyone. 
*   **D)** This reflects a common Classical interpretation of this Aesop's fable (*The Snake, the Weasel, and the Mice*). In many historical translations, the moral is that when ""great"" parties fight, the ""small"" should not rejoice or let their guard down, because the powerful often settle their differences at the expense of the weak. It warns that one is never truly safe just because their enemies are fighting.
*   **E)** This focuses on the ""home,"" which is secondary to the interaction between the characters.

While **A** is a modern interpretation of the ""collateral damage"" or ""third-party risk,"" **A** captures the essence of the mice's mistake: thinking that a conflict between two dangers makes them safe. However, in the context of the specific Aesop's fable tradition, the lesson is that the weak are never more at risk than when they mistakenly believe the powerful are too busy fighting each other to notice them.

In this specific multiple-choice context, **A** accurately describes the outcome: the bystanders (mice) suffered for involving themselves/emerging during a conflict between powerful parties.

morables_658,"A Goldfinch escaped from his Master's Cage, and the Master tried to get him back, but the bird refused to return. 'Well!' said the Boy, 'you'll regret it, because you'll never be as well cared for any",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the situation:

1.  **The Situation:** A bird has escaped from a cage where it was well-fed and ""cared for"" by a master. 
2.  **The Argument:** The master (the Boy) argues that the bird will regret leaving because it will never be ""as well cared for"" (referring to material security and food).
3.  **The Bird's Response:** The bird acknowledges that life might be harder or less comfortable, but explicitly states, ""I would rather take care of myself than be under your care.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The core conflict is between **security/comfort (the cage)** and **autonomy/freedom (the wild)**. The bird chooses the latter, implying that being in control of one's own life (liberty) is more valuable than being looked after while in captivity (wealth/comfort).

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) There is no wealth greater than liberty.** This directly captures the bird's preference for self-care and freedom over the material ""wealth"" of the master's care.
*   **B)** Irrelevant to the story's theme.
*   **C)** The boy doesn't necessarily show ""true concern,"" and the bird isn't ""masking"" anything; it is being direct.
*   **D)** This is a variation of ""Caelum non animum mutant,"" which doesn't fit the bird's liberation.
*   **E)** While the bird is pursuing freedom, the story focuses more on the *value* of that freedom compared to the comfort it left behind, rather than the ""risk"" involved.

Option A is the most classic and accurate interpretation of this Aesop-style fable, emphasizing that independence is the ultimate form of wealth.

The mole said to them, 'Silence your complaining, since you can see that I am deprived of eyes.'",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the character interactions step by step:

1.  **The Donkey and the Monkey:** Both animals are complaining about minor aesthetic or physical ""deficiencies"" (horns and a tail). These are features that are not necessarily essential for survival but are desired for vanity or preference.
2.  **The Mole's Intervention:** The mole interrupts them to point out a much more significant deprivation: the lack of sight.
3.  **The Lesson:** The mole's situation puts the complaints of the donkey and the monkey into perspective. It suggests that while we may be unhappy with small flaws or missing features, there are others facing much more severe hardships.
4.  **Comparing to the Options:** 
    *   **A** aligns perfectly with this logic: observing that others have it worse can help us bear our own misfortunes with more patience and gratitude.
    *   **B** refers to shared burdens, which isn't the focus here.
    *   **C** is a general truth about complaining, but doesn't address the comparison between the characters.
    *   **D** suggests a karmic retribution not present in the text.
    *   **E** focuses on ""unique gifts,"" whereas the mole focuses on a superior ""misfortune.""

The story is a classic Aesop-style fable teaching perspective through the comparison of misfortunes.

morables_42,"A Fox invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his entertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out into a broad flat stone dish. The soup fell out of the long bill of the Cra",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable ""The Fox and the Crane,"" let's examine the sequence of events:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The Fox plays a trick on the Crane by serving soup in a dish that the Crane cannot use due to his long beak. The Fox does this for her own amusement, disregarding the guest's needs.
2.  **The Crane's Reaction:** Instead of simply being a victim, the Crane replicates the Fox's behavior by inviting her to dinner and serving food in a long-necked vessel that only the Crane can access.
3.  **The Conclusion:** The story ends by stating the Fox met a ""fitting requital"" (getting what she deserved) based on her own style of hospitality.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) Do unto others what you would have them do unto you:** This is the ""Golden Rule."" The story illustrates the consequences of violating it. Because the Fox treated the Crane poorly, the Crane treated the Fox poorly in return. It serves as a warning that if you mistreat others, you should expect the same treatment.
*   **B) Beware the sort of person who uses tricks:** While the Fox is tricky, the story is more about the reciprocity of those tricks rather than a warning to stay away from such people.
*   **C) Cleverness can outwit vexation:** This describes the Crane's action, but isn't the overarching lesson about social conduct.
*   **D) A clever alliance with the powerless is futile:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) Consideration for others' needs fosters true hospitality:** While true in a general sense, the fable focuses specifically on the ""tit-for-tat"" nature of the interaction.

The most traditional and accurate moral for this specific fable is that how you treat others is how you will be treated.

Wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the persons in her father's house, he made some excuse to send her home o",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"Here is a step-by-step analysis of the fable's lesson:

1.  **Analyze the narrative:** A husband sends his wife, who is disliked by everyone at home, to her father’s house to see if her behavior improves or is perceived differently.
2.  **Evaluate the woman's report:** Upon returning, she complains that even the shepherds and herdsmen (people who are away in the fields for most of the day) looked at her with dislike.
3.  **Identify the husband's logic:** The husband concludes that if people who barely saw her (the shepherds) disliked her based on their brief interactions, then those who had to spend the entire day with her must have found her even more intolerable.
4.  **Determine the theme:** The story is about how small samples of behavior or small snippets of evidence can indicate a much larger truth or a broader pattern. In this case, the cold reception from ""incidental"" acquaintances (the shepherds) is the ""straw"" that indicates which way the ""wind"" (her overall reputation/character) is blowing.
5.  **Match with the options:** 
    *   **A) Straws show how the wind blows** is a classic idiom meaning that small signs or minor incidents indicate a larger trend or reality. This matches the husband's deduction perfectly.
    *   B, C, D, and E do not accurately reflect the logic of the husband's concluding statement or the specific nature of the observation made in the fable.

morables_693,"The coachman, hearing one of the wheels of his coach creak, was surprised; but more especially when he perceived that it was the worst wheel of the whole set, and which he thought had but little prete",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the text step by step:

1.  **Analyze the Plot:** The story describes a coachman who hears a wheel creaking. He is surprised to find that the wheel making the noise is the ""worst wheel of the whole set.""
2.  **Analyze the Conflict:** The coachman believes the wheel has ""little pretense to take such a liberty."" This implies that the wheel most in need of repair or least capable of performing its job is the one making the most noise (complaining).
3.  **Identify the Symbolism:** In fables, a ""creaking wheel"" is a common metaphor for someone who complains or makes a fuss. The fact that it is the *worst* wheel suggests that those who contribute the least or are in the weakest condition are often the ones who complain the loudest or demand the most attention.
4.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A) Complaining is the privilege of the weak:** This aligns with the idea that the ""worst"" wheel is the one creaking (complaining). It is a classic observation that those who are failing or are the least capable are often the most vocal about their grievances.
    *   **B), C), D):** These themes (kindness, curiosity, enemies) are not supported by the brief text provided.
    *   **E) Noise often masks vulnerability:** While plausible, the tone of the fable (""little pretense to take such a liberty"") focuses more on the *audacity* of the weak to complain rather than a strategic masking of vulnerability.

Specifically, this is a variation of Aesop's fable ""The Creaking Wheels,"" where the moral is often stated as: **""Those who do the least work often make the most noise""** or **""Complaining is the privilege of the weak.""**

morables_612,"There was a woman of Sybaris who broke a jar. The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, 'I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you'd gone right",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Event:** A woman of Sybaris breaks a jar.
2.  **The Reaction:** Instead of fixing the problem (the break), the jar (personified) focuses on seeking legal justice or assignation of blame by bringing a witness to testify. 
3.  **The Woman's Rebuttal:** The woman points out that the ""wise"" thing to do would have been to get a bandage (a practical repair) rather than making a court case (an argument/legal process).

**Analysis of Themes:**
The fable highlights the absurdity of prioritizing legalism, litigation, or verbal arguments over immediate, practical solutions. The jar is ""bleeding"" (metaphorically, as it is broken), yet it seeks a witness instead of a bandage. 

- **A) Action is more valuable than arguments:** This fits perfectly. The woman suggests that repairing the damage (action) is wiser than seeking a legal victory (argument/testimony).
- **B) You can't please everybody:** This is irrelevant to the text.
- **C) Practicality triumphs over sarcasm:** While the woman's tone is sarcastic, the lesson isn't about sarcasm winning; it's about the woman's advice for practicality being superior to the jar's desire for a trial. 
- **D) Practical fortune...:** This is overly complex and does not reflect the ""repair vs. litigate"" dynamic.
- **E) Small actions reveal hidden strengths:** The story is about a mistake and a response, not hidden internal strengths.

The core lesson is that when a problem occurs, one should focus on the practical remedy rather than the administrative or argumentative fallout.

When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict**: Two powerful, majestic groups (Dolphins and Whales) are engaged in a serious, destructive war.
2.  **The Mediator**: A tiny, insignficant fish (a Sprat) intervenes, offering to act as an umpire or peacemaker to settle their massive dispute.
3.  **The Reaction**: The Dolphin rejects the offer immediately. The reason given is not that they want to keep fighting based on the original grievance, but that they find the idea of an insignificant creature meddling in their ""noble"" affairs to be more offensive than the war itself.
4.  **The Subtext**: The focus of the fable is on **pride** and **status**. The large animals would rather face destruction than suffer the ""humiliation"" of being judged or helped by someone they consider social inferiors.

Let's evaluate the options:
*   A, B, and E are generic and don't capture the specific dynamic between the high-status animals and the low-status intruder.
*   **C (Pride often leads to unnecessary conflict)** accurately reflects the Dolphin's choice to continue a deadly war rather than swallow their pride and accept help from a ""lesser"" creature.

However, in many classical translations of Aesop's Fables (such as the Townsend version), this specific story concludes with the moral: ""Many a man of no consequence thinks a great deal of himself in times of disturbance."" The focus is often on the vanity of the Sprat *or* the pride of the Dolphins. Looking at the options provided, **C** is the most accurate distillation of the tragedy of the situation (choosing ruin over a loss of dignity).

1.  **The Context:** A Man and a Satyr form an alliance/friendship. This sets the stage for a relationship based on trust and consistency.
2.  **The First Action:** The Man blows on his hands to **warm** them.
3.  **The Second Action:** The Man blows on his food to **cool** it.
4.  **The Satyr’s Reaction:** The Satyr is disturbed by the fact that the same source (the Man’s breath/speech) can produce two opposite effects (hot and cold). 
5.  **The Metaphor:** In fables and idioms, ""blowing hot and cold"" refers to a person who is inconsistent, fickle, or double-tongued—someone who says one thing at one time and the opposite at another to suit their convenience.
6.  **The Conclusion:** Because the Man is capable of such inconsistency (even if physically logical in this specific story), the Satyr views him as unreliable and untrustworthy.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the metaphorical meaning of ""blowing hot and cold."" It addresses the loss of trust resulting from perceived inconsistency or doubling-dealing.
*   **B:** Incorrect; the Man did not make a wish that backfired.
*   **C:** Incorrect; while the Man was technically being ""adaptable,"" the story portrays this as a negative trait (hypocrisy or inconsistency) from the Satyr's perspective.
*   **D:** This is overly complex and does not relate to the specific actions of the story.
*   **E:** While somewhat plausible, the focus is specifically on the *contradiction* of the two actions rather than a hidden truth.

The traditional moral of this Aesop's fable is that one should avoid those who are double-tongued or inconsistent in their allegiances.

1.  **The Setting:** Socrates builds a ""modest"" or ""tiny"" house.
2.  **The Question:** A neighbor questions why a man of Socrates' stature would have such a small living space.
3.  **The Climax/Reply:** Socrates responds, ""if only I could fill it with true friends!""
4.  **Analysis:** Socrates is implying that even though his house is very small, it would still be difficult to find enough ""true friends"" to actually fill it. This highlights the rarity and preciousness of genuine friendship. While the narrator opens with a reflection on fame and public disapproval (which relates to option E), the actual ""point"" or punchline of the fable itself—the interaction regarding the house—centers on the scarcity of real friends.

*   **Option A** directly reflects Socrates' punchline about the difficulty of finding true friends.
*   **Option B** is irrelevant to the text.
*   **Option C** is a general statement not supported by this specific dialogue.
*   **Option D** is a critique of the narrator or Socrates but does not capture the intended lesson.

Admittedly, Prometheus had made the lion very large and handsome, supplying him with sharp fangs in his jaw and arming him w",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative progression step by step:

1.  **The Lion's Complaint:** Despite being the most powerful creature created by Prometheus, the lion is fixated on one specific weakness: his irrational fear of roosters. This perceived flaw makes him so miserable and ashamed that he contemplates suicide.
2.  **The Interaction with the Elephant:** The lion encounters the elephant, a creature even larger and more powerful than himself. He observes the elephant exhibiting a similar irrational fear (of a tiny gnat).
3.  **The Realization:** When the lion compares his situation to the elephant's, he realizes that even the mightiest creatures have vulnerabilities. He concludes that his situation is actually superior to the elephant's because a rooster is at least a more substantial threat than a gnat. 
4.  **The Conclusion:** The lion regains his self-worth and loses his desire to die because he recognizes that his struggle is not unique and that others have it harder (or are bothered by even lesser things).

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) There is always someone else worse off than you:** This aligns perfectly with the lion's shift in perspective. He stops pitying himself once he sees the elephant's struggle.
*   **B) No matter how you brag...:** The lion isn't bragging; he is mourning his weakness.
*   **C) Strength alone does not guarantee invulnerability:** While true, the story's resolution isn't about the *danger* of the gnats/roosters, but about the lion's *perspective* on his own flaws.
*   **D) and E):** These options relate to other common fables (like those involving lions and foxes) but do not apply to the specific interactions in this text.

The moral is that looking at the struggles of others can provide perspective on one's own problems, showing that everyone has weaknesses.

The goddess clearly hates you so much that she has taken",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the characters:

1.  **The Context:** In Greek mythology and folklore (Aesop's Fables), the crow was often seen as a bird of ill omen. The dog points out that Athena has made the crow's omens unreliable, suggesting she is the crow's enemy or at least dislikes her.
2.  **The Crow's Action:** Despite the goddess’s apparent hostility, the crow continues to sacrifice to her.
3.  **The Reasoning:** The crow explicitly states that because the goddess is currently her enemy (or ill-disposed toward her), she must be even more diligent in her offerings to win her over or ""change her attitude.""

Now let's evaluate the options:
- **A:** This matches the crow's strategy. The crow treats an ""enemy"" (Athena) well (offering sacrifices/gifts) specifically to gain a favor or change the enemy's disposition.
- **B:** This is a generic piece of advice not reflected in the story’s logic.
- **C:** While ""hope"" is present, the story is specifically about a transactional relationship with an adversary.
- **D:** This is actually a different moral associated with a different Aesop fable about a crow (The Crow and the Pitcher).
- **E:** The story isn't about the friendship between the dog and the crow, but the crow's relationship with the goddess.

In the tradition of Aesop's fables (Perry Index 212), this story illustrates how people often use gifts or kindness to appease those who are hostile toward them in the hopes of reconciliation or gain.

The story goes that when a male hyena was treating a female badly, she said to him",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"In this fable, attributed to Aesop, the key element is the cyclical role reversal: the victim (female) reminds the aggressor (male) that their positions will be swapped in the future. The female hyena's warning serves as a reminder to those currently in power or in a superior position that they should not mistreat others, as the tables will eventually turn, and they will find themselves subject to the same treatment or judgment they currently dispense.

Let's evaluate the options:
- **A** captures the essence of the ""reversal of roles."" While ""teachers"" is a specific application, the broader proverbial meaning is that those being judged or mistreated today will be the ones judging tomorrow.
- **B** refers to a different set of Aesop's fables (like the Fox and the Crow).
- **C** is too generic and doesn't address the specific ""exchange"" of roles.
- **D** focuses on the biological myth of the hyena as a negative trait, whereas the fable uses it as a metaphor for the cyclical nature of status.
- **E** is a modern ""self-help"" interpretation that doesn't fit the cautionary tone of the classic fable.

The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Proposition:** The lion (king of the land) and the dolphin (king of the sea) form an alliance based on their status and roles. They assume their mutual power makes them perfect partners.
2.  **The Conflict:** The lion enters a battle on land (against the wild bull) and calls upon his ally for help.
3.  **The Failure:** despite the dolphin's willingness, his physical nature prevents him from leaving the water to assist on land.
4.  **The Accusation and Lesson:** The lion feels betrayed, but the dolphin points out that he is physically incapable of helping on land. The ""betrayal"" wasn't a lack of will, but a lack of ability.

The lesson is that when choosing an ally or friend, it is not enough that they are powerful or high-status; they must be capable of helping you in the specific environment or situation where you need them. If a land animal chooses a sea animal as a military ally, the alliance is functionally useless during a land battle.

*   **Option A** directly addresses this: ""When we form friendships with one another, we must choose allies who can come to our aid in moments of peril."" 
*   **Option B** is incorrect because the dolphin did not *want* to betray the lion; he was physically restricted.

The fox then ask",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the climax:

1.  **The Situation:** A fox attempts to trick a cicada into coming down from a tree to eat it, using flattery as a weapon.
2.  **The Response:** The cicada is not fooled. He tests the fox by dropping a leaf, confirming the fox's predatory intent when she pounces on it.
3.  **The Justification:** The cicada reveals *why* he was so prepared: ""I've been on my guard against foxes ever since I saw the wings of a cicada in the spoor of a fox.""

The core lesson is that the cicada avoided a deadly fate by observing what happened to others of his kind. He learned from the ""misfortunes of his neighbors"" (the remains of the other cicada in the fox's droppings) and used that knowledge to protect himself.

*   **Option A** directly reflects this: A discerning/wise person (the cicada) learns from the misfortunes of others.
*   Option B is irrelevant to the text.
*   Option C describes the fox's behavior but doesn't capture the ultimate lesson of the cicada's survival.
*   Option D suggests a self-fulfilling prophecy, which is the opposite of what happens (the cicada successfully avoids his fate).
*   Option E is partially true regarding the fox, but doesn't encompass the cicada's wisdom, which is the focus of the ending.

This fable is traditionally attributed to Aesop, and ""The misfortunes of others should be our lessons"" or ""A wise man learns from the misfortunes of others"" is the classical moral associated with it.

morables_422,"The Goat, going abroad to feed, shut up her young Kid at borne, charging him to bolt the door fast, and open it to nobody, till she herself should return. The Wolf, who lay lurking just by, heard this",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The setup:** A mother Goat gives her Kid a specific instruction (keep the door bolted) to ensure safety.
2.  **The conflict:** A Wolf (a natural predator) attempts to deceive the Kid by mimicking the mother's voice to gain entry.
3.  **The discovery:** Despite the Wolf's vocal imitation (the ""counterfeit"" behavior), the Kid inspects the situation more closely from the window.
4.  **The resolution:** The Kid recognizes that the Wolf's physical appearance and nature do not match his words/voice. The Kid identifies the ""cheat.""
5.  **The lesson:** The story illustrates that an individual trying to pretend to be something they are not (a hypocrite or an impostor) can be detected if one looks closely enough at their true nature or actions.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) A hypocrite can usually be found out.** This aligns perfectly with the Kid identifying the Wolf's disguise/mimicry as a ""cheat.""
*   **B)** Irrelevant; there is no discussion of people's demise or hidden desires for death in this context.
*   **C)** While the Kid was careful, ""caring hearts"" isn't the focus; rather, it is the Kid's vigilance and the failure of the Wolf's disguise.
*   **D)** This is a moral often associated with the fable ""The Mountain in Labour"" or stories about cowards, which does not fit here.
*   **E)** The Goat actually provided oversight by giving instructions; the peril was avoided because the instructions were followed.

Historically, this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Wolf and the Kid"") concludes with the moral that ""Two sure checks are better than one"" or, increasingly in classic translations, that ""A hypocrite can usually be found out"" or ""An imposter may disguise his voice, but his appearance will betray him.""

Apollo immediately explained to the snake, 'If you had simply killed the first person who ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the interaction between the snake and Apollo:

1.  **The Context:** The snake is suffering because it is constantly being stepped on. This implies a lack of respect or a lack of fear from others toward the snake.
2.  **Apollo's Advice:** Apollo points out that the snake’s current predicament (being stepped on by ""many people"") is a result of its failure to react to the *first* person.
3.  **The Reasoning:** By failing to punish or strike back at the first offender, the snake signaled that there were no consequences for mistreating it. Had the snake acted swiftly and decisively against the first offender, it would have established a deterrent, making others ""afraid"" to repeat the action.
4.  **The Universal Lesson:** In the context of Aesop’s fables (from which this story originates), this serves as a metaphor for justice and social order. It suggests that if an initial transgression is punished immediately/severely, it serves as a warning to the public, preventing future offenses.

*   **Option A** aligns perfectly with this logic: It emphasizes that swift punishment for a crime creates a deterrent effect (""others will become afraid"").
*   **Option B** focuses on ""wicked people"" committing crimes in haste, which doesn't fit the snake's role as a victim.
*   **Option C** argues against immediate action, which contradicts Apollo's advice.
*   **Option D** mentions cleverness, but Apollo's advice was about forceful retaliation/punishment.
*   **Option E** focuses on the sanctuary of the temple, which is merely the setting, not the lesson.

Conclusion: The story teaches that the failure to punish the first offense invites further offenses, whereas swift punishment acts as a deterrent.

morables_230,"A lion was standing over a young bull whom he had killed when a robber showed up and demanded a part of the spoils. 'I would agree,' the lion said, 'if you were not already in the habit of taking what",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions within the fable:

1.  **The Robber (The Villain):** He approaches with a sense of entitlement and a history of taking things by force (""the habit of taking whatever you want""). The lion identifies his greed and refuses him as a matter of principle.
2.  **The Wayfarer (The Innocent):** He approaches with humility and fear, acknowledging the lion's power and showing no sense of entitlement.
3.  **The Lion's Reaction:** The lion rewards the wayfarer’s ""modesty"" and lack of aggression by sharing the prize, while rebuking the robber’s arrogance.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between the robber (force/resistance) and the wayfarer (humility/generosity).
*   **B:** While the robber is untrustworthy, the story focuses more on his greed and entitlement than a specific act of ""betrayal.""
*   **C:** The wayfarer didn't ""tame"" the lion through an act of kindness; the lion acted based on the wayfarer's lack of arrogance.
*   **D:** This is incorrect as the ""modest"" character (the wayfarer) is the one who benefits, and he isn't using cunning.
*   **E:** While applicable to the robber, it doesn't encompass the lesson taught by the wayfarer's success.

The story teaches that those who demand things through aggression or sense of entitlement are rejected, whereas those who are humble and respectful often receive favor. This is a classic Phaedrus fable (""The Lion, the Robber, and the Wayfarer"") which highlights that the virtuous are rewarded while the wicked are rebuffed.

Since he was constantly paying out money and spending great sums on the offerings, the god came to him one night and said: 'L",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A man is performing excessive, expensive sacrifices to a hero (a minor deity/god) in his home. He is spending so much that he is risking his financial stability.
2.  **The Intervention:** The god appears to him in a dream/at night.
3.  **The Warning:** The god tells him to stop ""squandering"" his wealth. 
4.  **The Reasoning:** The god's motivation is self-preservation. He explicitly states that if the man becomes poor due to his own overspending, the man will inevitably blame the god for his poverty (even though the man's own lack of moderation caused it).

Now, let's evaluate the options:

*   **A) When people suffer misfortune because of their own foolishness, they often blame the gods.** This fits perfectly. The god warns that the man's foolish overspending will lead to poverty, and the man will blame the god instead of his own actions.
*   **B) People are often quick to make promises...** There are no specific promises made or broken here; it's about reckless spending.
*   **C) Extravagance often clouds wise counsel.** While the man is extravagant, the story is specifically about the shift of blame/responsibility.
*   **D) Few extravagant things are done except for concerned profit.** The man's motive isn't explicitly profit; it's presumably devotion or superstition.
*   **E) True devotion is measured by actions, not offerings.** While a noble sentiment, the god isn't critiquing the *quality* of the man's devotion, but rather warning about the consequences of his financial ruin and the subsequent blame.

**Conclusion:** The central point of the god's warning is that humans create their own ruin through excess and then project the responsibility onto divine or outside forces.

When he saw the reflection of his body in the water, he disparaged the slenderness of his legs but revelled in the shape and",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the events step by step:

1.  **The Conflict of Perception:** The stag views his body parts through the lens of vanity. He dislikes his legs because they are ""slender"" (unattractive) and loves his horns because of their ""shape and size"" (impressive/beautiful).
2.  **The Crisis:** When hunters pursue him, his thin legs—the part he despised—provide him with the speed and utility to outrun the threat. 
3.  **The Catastrophe:** His horns—the part he took pride in—physically snag on branches, leading to his capture and death.
4.  **The Realization:** In his final moments, the stag explicitly states the lesson: the things he undervalued (his legs) were the things that could have saved him, while the things he boasted of (his horns) caused his destruction.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) What is most truly valuable is often underrated:** This aligns perfectly with the stag's realization that his ""ugly"" legs were actually his most valuable asset.
*   **B) It is often the case that people are greedy for things...:** While close, ""greedy"" isn't quite the right word; the stag isn't seeking more horns, he is simply vain about the ones he has.
*   **C) Persistence outshines vanity:** The story is not about persistence, but about utility vs. appearance.
*   **D) Vain deceivers...:** There is no ""deceiver"" in this story; the stag is only deceiving himself.
*   **E) Pride in appearances can blind us to our true strengths:** This is also a strong candidate. However, in the context of traditional Aesopic fables, the emphasis is usually on the **reversal of value** (the useful vs. the ornamental). Option A is the most concise summary of the stag's specific lament.

In many classical translations of this fable (Aesop's ""The Stag and His Reflection""), the moral is phrased as: ""We often despise what is most useful to us."" This is best captured by Option A.

But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at ",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the plot step-by-step:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Eagle, a powerful predator, ignores the plea of the Beetle (a small, seemingly insignificant creature) and disrespects her while hunting a Hare.
2.  **The Retaliation:** Despite being ""weak"" compared to the Eagle, the Beetle uses persistence and cleverness to destroy the Eagle's eggs repeatedly.
3.  **The Escalation:** Even when the Eagle seeks the protection of the highest power (Jupiter), the Beetle finds a way to cause the eggs to fall.
4.  **The Outcome:** Jupiter acknowledges the justice of the Beetle's cause. The story illustrates that the Eagle’s strength did not protect her from the consequences of mistreating someone she deemed inferior.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) The weak may find a way to avenge a wrong.** This aligns perfectly with the Beetle's actions. Even the smallest creature can bring down the powerful if they have been wronged.
*   **B)** This focuses on greed, which is not a theme here (the Beetle seeks justice/revenge, not honor or wealth).
*   **C)** While the Eagle lacked restraint, the core of the story is about the Beetle's successful revenge.
*   **D)** Beauty is not a factor in this fable.
*   **E)** There is no compassion shown between the predator and prey (the Hare is eaten).

The primary lesson is that even the most powerful should not mistreat the weak, as the weak can still find ways to retaliate.

At a certain m",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the progression of events:

1.  **Initial Event:** Through a genuine accident, the donkey discovers that falling into water dissolves salt and lightens his burden.
2.  **The Deception:** The donkey intentionally repeats the ""accident"" to avoid work, tricking the merchant.
3.  **The Merchant’s Reaction:** The merchant realizes he is being manipulated. To punish the donkey and correct the behavior, he swaps the salt for sponges.
4.  **The Result:** The donkey tries the same trick again, but because sponges absorb water rather than dissolving, he is saddled with a much heavier load.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **B, C, and D:** These contain philosophical fluff or phrasing that doesn't directly relate to the specific cause-and-effect of the donkey's trickery and the merchant's retaliation. 
*   **E:** This describes the initial accident but ignores the eventual consequence of the donkey's intentional deceit.
*   **A:** This aligns with the ""trickster tricked"" motif common in Aesop’s fables. It highlights that while a trick might work once, a clever person (the merchant) will eventually see through the deception and turn it against the trickster. The donkey's attempt to repeat his trickery led to his downfall because he could no longer fool the merchant.

The story teaches that deceitful tricks eventually backfire when the victim realizes they are being fooled.

Even after stroking the animal he was not sure of its i,0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the key elements:

1.  **The Subject:** A blind man who relies on touch (intuition and physical characteristics) rather than sight.
2.  **The Object:** A wolf cub, an animal that is biologically a predator but is currently young and hasn't yet committed any ""crimes.""
3.  **The Observation:** Despite the animal’s small size and youthful appearance, the man senses an inherent nature or ""vibe."" He identifies that the creature possesses an essence that is incompatible with the safety of a flock of sheep.
4.  **The Lesson:** The man recognizes the potential for danger or the ""evil"" nature of the wolf even before it has grown into an adult or acted upon its instincts. This points to the idea that inherent traits and character flaws are present from the very beginning.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Evil tendencies are shown in early life:** This aligns perfectly with the man identifying danger in a mere cub. It suggests that a creature's (or person's) essential nature is detectable regardless of age or development.
*   **B) Harsh means:** There is no conflict or punishment described in the story.
*   **C) Appearances can be misleading:** While true in some contexts, the blind man is specifically looking *past* the ""cute"" exterior of a cub to its true nature. However, the story focuses more on the *innate nature* of the cub rather than a deception. 
*   **D) Reward and punishment:** No rewards or punishments are administered in the text.
*   **E) Familiarity concealing truth:** This does not fit, as the man is suspicious of the animal precisely because it is *unfamiliar* to his hands.

Classic collections of Aesop's Fables traditionally attribute the moral ""Evil tendencies are shown in early life"" (or variations regarding the ""wicked nature"" appearing early) to this specific story.

This man noticed that all sorts of people came to him, and he became curious to see who were true friend",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"The story describes a man who uses a test to distinguish between those who enjoy his wealth (freeloaders) and those who are loyal to his person (true friends).

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1. **The Context:** The Rich Man provides abundance, which attracts a large crowd (""never lacked guests"").
2. **The Conflict:** He suspects that the quantity of companions does not equal the quality of friendship. He creates a scenario involving risk (a quarrel requiring swords) to see who will stand by him when there is personal cost involved.
3. **The Outcome:** Out of a ""full table"" of people, only two remain loyal. The overwhelming majority prioritize their own safety/convenience over their relationship with the host.
4. **The Lesson:** The core of the story illustrates how rare it is to find someone whose loyalty extends beyond the benefits they receive. While the rich man had many guests, he had very few friends.

Reviewing the options:
- **A** captures the central takeaway: despite a crowd of associates, real loyalty is rare.
- **B** is irrelevant (seems to be a moral for a different fable about animals/life).
- **C** is a piece of advice, but not the primary observation of the story.
- **D** is partially true, but ""loyal beliefs"" is clunky; it's about actions and presence.
- **E** is a strong contender, but ""sincerity keeps it"" implies the host's sincerity, whereas the story is about the guests' loyalty.

Option **A** is the most direct and classic distillation of this fable’s message.

The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, 'Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch m",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this story, let’s analyze the interaction between the two characters:

1.  **The Characters:** One pot is made of brass (strong, durable, and heavy) and the other is made of earthenware (fragile, brittle, and easily broken).
2.  **The Situation:** They are both being carried by the same river (life’s circumstances or fate). In this environment, they are prone to bumping into one another.
3.  **The Dialogue:** The Earthen Pot recognizes that a collision—even a slight one—would be fatal for it, but would likely not harm the Brass Pot. The Earthen Pot acknowledges that despite their shared journey, they are not a safe match for one another.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates that an alliance or close proximity between the powerful (the brass) and the vulnerable (the earthenware) is inherently dangerous for the latter. True safety and mutual understanding are most easily found among peers of similar standing or strength.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Equals make the best friends:** This is the classical moral of this Aesop fable. It highlights that friendship between the strong and the weak is often lopsided and dangerous for the weaker party.
*   **B) Do not overestimate your worth...** The Earthen Pot actually accurately estimates its fragility; it is not overestimating itself.
*   **C & E)** These are modern, ""participation trophy"" sentiments that focus on intrinsic value, which is not the pragmatic point of the original fable.
*   **D)** This is a generic statement that doesn't capture the specific dynamic of the two pots.

The traditional moral emphasizes that the weak should beware of association with the strong, as the consequences of a ""clash"" are borne entirely by the weak.

The wild boar replied, 'I have",0.0,A,2,low,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** The wild boar is sharpening his tusks even though there is no immediate threat or hunter in sight.
2.  **The Question:** The fox, representing curiosity or a ""live in the moment"" mindset, questions the necessity of the work when there is no current danger.
3.  **The Reason:** The boar explains that once danger arrived, it would be too late to prepare. He must prepare his weapons during times of peace/quiet so they are ready for instant use during a crisis.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core theme is the importance of **preparedness**. By preparing ahead of time, one is ready for future challenges.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace:** This aligns with the boar's logic of being ready before a threat arrives. (Often summarized in the Latin adage *Si vis pacem, para bellum* - ""If you want peace, prepare for war"").
*   **B) God is the ultimate judge:** There is no religious or judicial theme in the story.
*   **C) Curiosity must be guided by prudence:** While the fox is curious, the focus of the story is on the boar's foresight, not the fox's folly.
*   **D) Prudent men feel worst when they contribute to their own inquisitive undoing:** This does not fit the narrative; no one is undone by their own actions here.
*   **E) Even nature prepares its own defenses:** While true, this is a literal observation rather than a moral lesson for the reader.

Option A is the traditional moral associated with this Aesop's fable (The Wild Boar and the Fox), emphasizing that we should prepare in times of peace for the seasons of need.

When the depositor then summoned him to swear an oath regarding the deposit, he realized the danger he was in and prepar",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the dialogue between the man and the god, Oath:

1.  **The action:** A man stolen from a friend plans to commit perjury (swear a false oath) to keep a stolen deposit.
2.  **The meeting:** He meets the god Oath, who tells him he usually visits cities every 30 or 40 years.
3.  **The reaction:** The man concludes he is safe for a long time and immediately commits the crime (swearing the false oath).
4.  **The consequence:** He is caught by Oath the very next day and taken to be punished.
5.  **The lesson/explanation:** When the man protests the timing, Oath explains that while he *usually* takes decades, he can return the *same day* if provoked.

**Analyzing the Options:**
*   **A) There is no fixed day on which wicked people are punished:** This directly reflects the god's explanation. The man thought he had 30 years, but the punishment came instantly. It highlights the unpredictability of justice/divine retribution.
*   **B) Often there is more good...:** This is irrelevant to the story.
*   **C) Fear distorts...:** While the man was afraid, his downfall was actually his *lack* of fear once he thought he had time; he was emboldened by a false sense of security.
*   **D) He who incites to deceptive strife...:** This doesn't fit the narrative of a man lying to a god.
*   **E) Taking what isn't yours... conscience:** The story is more about the external punishment from the god (Oath) than the internal feeling of a ""debt on your conscience.""

**Conclusion:**
The story serves as a warning that one cannot predict when they will be held accountable for their sins. Thinking you have ""time"" to get away with a crime is a fallacy because punishment can strike at any moment. This matches Option A perfectly.

The brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their feathers, whe",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the progression of the narrative:

1.  **The First Event:** The farmer asks his neighbors for help. The mother Lark remains calm because people who rely on others (friends or neighbors) to do their work are often not proactive, meaning the task likely won't get done immediately.
2.  **The Second Event:** The farmer realizes the neighbors aren't coming and that the grain is falling from ripeness. He decides to take action himself, hiring laborers and committing to do the work personally the very next day.
3.  **The Conclusion:** The mother Lark realizes that once a person decides to do the work themselves rather than relying on others, the job will finally be completed. 

The central theme is that true progress and results come from personal initiative and self-reliance rather than waiting for or expecting others to do the work for you.

*   **A) Self-help is the best help:** This aligns perfectly with the lesson that the harvest only happens when the farmer takes responsibility himself.
*   **B) Cunning often outwits itself:** There is no ""cunning"" or trickery involved in the story.
*   **C) Wisdom grows with determination:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific theme of self-reliance vs. dependency.
*   **D) Do unto others...:** This is the ""Golden Rule,"" which is about morality and kindness, not productivity or self-reliance.
*   **E) Even the tiniest cradle...:** This is a poetic observation about nature, not a moral lesson derived from the farmer's actions.

The traditional moral of this Aesop's fable is that ""Self-help is the best help.""

As soon as he realized what was going on, Aesop -- who w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Context:** Aesop is observed engaging in a ""childish"" activity (playing marbles). A bystander (the Athenian) laughs at him, assuming that a wise man playing games must be foolish or ""crazy.""
2.  **The Riddle:** Aesop uses a metaphor involving a bow to counter the man's mockery. He asks the man to explain the significance of an unstrung bow.
3.  **The Explanation:** Aesop explains that if a bow is kept under constant tension (tightly strung), it will lose its elasticity and break. If it is allowed to rest (unstrung), it remains functional and strong for when it is actually needed.
4.  **The Lesson:** The ""bow"" is a metaphor for the human mind or spirit. The story suggests that constant work, seriousness, or intellectual strain is unsustainable. Just as the bow needs to be unstrung to remain useful, a person needs play and relaxation to remain wise and effective.

While option E is a common theme in Aesop's life, the specific lesson regarding the **bow** is about the necessity of rest and relaxation to maintain one's faculties.

- **Option A** identifies that ""resting the mind"" (unstringing the bow) is essential for maintaining its function.
- **Option B** is irrelevant to the text.
- **Option C** describes the interaction but not the specific lesson Aesop teaches.
- **Option D** describes Aesop's action but is not the universal moral.
- **Option E** is a secondary observation, but the primary moral stated by Aesop himself concerns the necessity of rest.

The most direct interpretation of the ""unstrung bow"" metaphor is that one must take time to relax to remain mentally sharp.

morables_377,"The story goes that a sow who had delivered a whole litter of piglets loudly accosted a lioness, 'How many children do you breed?' asked the sow. 'I breed only one,' said the lioness, 'but he is very ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the sow and the lioness:

1.  **The Characters' Actions:** The sow is boasting about the size of her litter (numerical quantity). She ""loudly accosts"" the lioness to compare her productivity.
2.  **The Lioness's Response:** The lioness acknowledges she only produces one offspring at a time, but emphasizes the nature of that offspring: ""but he is very well bred!"" (In many translations of this Aesop fable, the line is ""One, but a lion"").
3.  **The Contrast:** The story contrasts the **quantity** of the sow (many piglets) with the **quality** of the lioness (one magnificent lion).
4.  **The Lesson:** The lioness's retort serves to silence the sow's boasting by pointing out that a single superior thing is worth more than many inferior or common things.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Quality is more valuable than quantity:** This directly reflects the contrast between the many piglets and the single lion.
*   **B) Gossips are to be seen and not heard:** This does not fit the context of the interaction.
*   **C) Confidence without humility leads astray:** While the sow lacks humility, the focus is specifically on the value of the offspring.
*   **D) It is good to set aside our proud disputes...:** This is a moral often associated with other fables (like The Two Goats), focusing on conflict resolution rather than value.
*   **E) Nurturing is key:** The story is about the inherent nature/quality of the offspring, not the parenting process.

The moral is clearly that one high-quality item outweighs a large number of low-quality items.

morables_179,"Running swiftly, balancing on the razor's edge, bald but with a lock of hair on his forehead, he wears no clothes; if you grasp him from the front, you might be able to hold him, but once he has moved",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the imagery and the message step by step:

1.  **The Imagery**: The figure described is the personification of ""Opportunity"" (often identified as Kairos in Greek mythology).
2.  **The Characteristics**: 
    *   **""Running swiftly"" and ""balancing on the razor's edge""**: This conveys that opportunity is fleeting and precarious.
    *   **""Bald but with a lock of hair on his forehead""**: This is the most famous part of the allegory. He has hair in the front so you can grab him as he approaches.
    *   **""Once he has moved on not even Jupiter himself can pull him back""**: The back of his head is bald, meaning there is nothing to grab once he has passed you by. Even the king of the gods cannot retrieve a missed opportunity.
3.  **The Explicit Lesson**: The text concludes by stating he is a symbol of ""the brief moment in which things are possible.""

**Analysis of Options**:
*   **A) Seize opportunities when they arise**: This directly aligns with the idea of grabbing the ""forelock"" of the figure before he passes. It emphasizes the need for immediate action before the moment is lost forever.
*   **B) Be content with your lot**: The story is about action and timing, not contentment.
*   **C) Power without purpose is ineffectual**: While Jupiter is powerful, the story focuses on the nature of time and opportunity, not the misuse of power.
*   **D) Boast of one powerful thing...**: This is derived from a different fable (The Fox and the Cat), not this one.
*   **E) Every daring act teeters on...**: While ""razor's edge"" suggests risk, the core of the story is the impossibility of catching opportunity once it has passed.

The central message is that opportunity must be caught ""from the front"" (immediately) because it cannot be caught from behind (after it has passed).

morables_597,"A fox was standing not far from a trap, pondering every possible approach. A nearby wolf noticed the fox and approached her. He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the character's actions step-by-step:

1.  **The Setup:** The fox is clearly aware of the trap (she is ""pondering every possible approach"" and standing at a safe distance). 
2.  **The Deception:** When the wolf asks for the meat, the fox uses flattery and the pretense of friendship (""my very dearest friends"") to encourage the wolf to walk into the danger she has already identified.
3.  **The Outcome:** The wolf is injured by the trap, and he realizes the fox's ""gift"" was actually a malicious trick disguised as kindness.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story warns against people who use honeyed words and ""generous"" offers to lead others into harm. The fox’s ""friendship"" was a facade used to test the trap at the wolf's expense.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A)** This fits perfectly. The fox uses flattery (""dearest friends"") and deception to harm the wolf for her own benefit/safety.
*   **B)** This focuses on the wolf's ignorance, but the primary thematic driver is the fox's betrayal.
*   **C)** While true, it is less specific to the element of the ""flatterer"" present in the text.
*   **D)** This is the moral of the ""Fox and the Cat"" (the ""one trick"" fable), which is a different story.
*   **E)** The story discourages this specific collaboration because it was founded on a lie.

The most accurate moral for this specific fable (often attributed to Aesop or Babrius) is that one must be wary of ""gifts"" or kindness offered by those who have a motive to deceive.

Winter was approaching, so one of the dung beetles said to the other, 'I want to g",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the interactions between the characters:

1.  **The Promise:** One beetle promises the other that if he finds a good feeding ground on the mainland, he will bring some food back for his companion.
2.  **The Reality:** The beetle finds an abundance of food, eats his fill, and becomes ""plump and fat,"" but he returns empty-handed.
3.  **The Excuse:** When confronted about the broken promise, the beetle blames the ""nature of the place,"" claiming the food could not be transported.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights how a promise made in a time of need or during a transition is easily broken once one participant becomes comfortable and selfish. The focus is on the unreliability of words versus the reality of actions.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A) Beware of empty promises made during good times:** This fits the narrative. The beetle made a promise of generosity, but when he found himself in a ""good time"" (plenty of food), he focused only on himself and made excuses for why he didn't help his friend.
- **B) We should not pick fights with people stronger than we are:** Incorrect; there is no conflict or display of strength vs. weakness in terms of combat.
- **C) Curiosity can uncover hidden resources:** Incorrect; while he found food, the story's climax is about the broken promise, not the discovery.
- **D) There's a curious time for work and an expectant time for play:** Incorrect; this does not reflect the beetle's behavior.
- **E) Even the smallest creatures find value in what others discard:** While true of dung beetles generally, it is not the moral message regarding the relationship and the broken promise in this specific fable.

The fable teaches us to be skeptical of those who offer great promises when they are seeking their own benefit or facing a change, as they often fail to deliver once they are satisfied.

When they came to a well, one of them thought that they should jump in immediately, but the other one said, ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the steps:

1.  **Analyze the Plot:** Two frogs are looking for a new home because their pond dried up. They find a well. One frog wants to jump in immediately because it contains water.
2.  **Identify the Conflict:** The second frog pauses to consider the long-term consequences. While the well has water now, they are deep in the ground. If that water dries up (just as their previous pond did), they will be trapped at the bottom with no way to jump back out.
3.  **Identify the Lesson:** The story highlights the importance of considering the potential dangers or future outcomes of an action before committing to it. The first frog is impulsive, while the second frog is cautious and forward-thinking.
4.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **A) Look before you leap:** This idiom means one should check for dangers or consequences before jumping into a situation. This matches the story perfectly (both literally and metaphorically).
    *   **B) Watch the actions of your enemy:** There is no enemy in this story.
    *   **C) Haste often leads to regret:** While true, ""Look before you leap"" is the specific traditional moral associated with this Aesop's fable and more accurately describes the act of assessing a ""trap"" or ""dead end.""
    *   **D) Impulsive, vicious people...:** There is no malice or ""hurting of others"" in this story.
    *   **E) Adaptability is key...:** The frogs are trying to adapt, but the story is specifically about the *caution* required while doing so, not just the act of adapting.

The moral is a classic warning against acting without thinking about the outcome.

morables_368,"Thanks to his excellent qualities, Hercules was received into heaven. He saluted the gods who came to congratulate him one after another, but when he was approached by Plutus, the god of wealth and th",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **Characterization of Hercules**: Hercules represents ""virtue"" and ""excellent qualities."" His entry into heaven is a result of these merits, not material wealth.
2.  **The Conflict**: Hercules acknowledges all the gods except Plutus (Wealth). This snub is intentional.
3.  **The Reasoning**: When questioned by Jupiter, Hercules explains his disdain. He views Plutus (the god of wealth) as a ""friend to the wicked"" who ""corrupts the entire world."" 
4.  **The Lesson**: The core of Hercules’ argument is that wealth is often associated with the lack of virtue and that true merit (which earned Hercules his place in heaven) is opposed to the corrupting influence of money.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A**: This captures the idea that money interferes with ""honest traffic in praise"" (merit-based recognition). Historically, many translations of Aesop's fables use this specific phrase for this story, implying that wealth makes praise cheap or dishonest.
*   **B**: Focuses on the hidden threats of an easy life, which isn't the primary point of Hercules' specific complaint about corruption.
*   **C**: While true to the story's spirit, Hercules' complaint is more specific: wealth actively supports the wicked and corrupts the world.
*   **D**: This focuses on thieves, which is not the subject of the fable.
*   **E**: While Hercules entered heaven through virtue, the *climax* and *dialogue* of the story are specifically about his hatred for the corruption caused by wealth.

In classic translations of Phaedrus (who recorded this Aesopic fable), the moral is often stated as: ""Wealth is the handmaid of the wicked, and the foe of the righteous,"" or specifically regarding the corruption of honest praise/reward. In many standardized tests or literary collections using this specific version, ""A"" is the traditional moral assigned.

morables_301,"A dog made false accusations against the sheep, demanding that she pay him back a loaf of bread which, he insisted, the sheep had supposedly borrowed from him. The dog summoned the wolf as his witness",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the conclusion:

1.  **The Conflict:** A dog and a wolf conspire to frame an innocent sheep through false testimony (lying).
2.  **The Result of the Lie:** The sheep is unjustly punished and forced to pay for something she did not do.
3.  **The Resolution:** Shortly after the injustice, the sheep discovers the wolf (the liar) dead in a ditch.
4.  **The Lesson:** The sheep explicitly states the moral: ""This is the reward that gods give to liars.""

**Step-by-step evaluation of the options:**
*   **A) Wicked liars generally get their just consequences:** This aligns perfectly with the sheep's final statement and the wolf's fate. It suggests a ""poetic justice"" where those who deceive eventually suffer for their actions.
*   **B) Harsh means vs. Reason:** The story is about perjury and justice, not about methods of persuasion or education.
*   **C) Deception masks innocence:** While true, the story focuses more on the *outcome* for the deceiver rather than the nature of the mask itself.
*   **D) Inviting further insults:** The story ends with the death of the aggressor, suggesting an end to the deception rather than a cycle of it.
*   **E) Fabric of trust:** While false claims do damage trust, the story emphasizes the divine or karmic punishment (the wolf's death) rather than the social implications of trust.

The sheep's observation that the wolf's death is a ""reward"" for lying points directly to the concept of ""just consequences"" for wicked behavior.

'What have I done that I must die?' said she; 'I have stolen neither gold nor silver, but only a grain of corn to satisfy my ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this fable (often attributed to Aesop), let’s look at the interaction between the Lark and the Fowler:

1.  **The Situation:** The Lark is trapped and helpless. She attempts to defend herself using logic and morality, pointing out that her ""crime"" (eating a grain of corn) is minor and born of necessity, unlike stealing gold or silver.
2.  **The Response:** The Fowler does not engage with her logic. He doesn't care about the scale of her offense or her innocence because he is the one with the power and the one who stands to benefit from her death.
3.  **The Outcome:** The predator/captor (adjudicator of her fate) kills her despite her plea.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A)** accurately reflects the power dynamic. When the person you are arguing with is the same person who has decided your fate and has the power to carry it out, logic and morality are often ignored.
- **B)** applies more to the ""Greedy Dog"" or ""The Boy and the Filberts,"" where greed leads to loss.
- **C)** is factually contradicted by the text (the man is silent and merciless).
- **D)** is a convoluted phrasing that doesn't fit the simplicity of the Fowler's actions.
- **E)** is contradicted by the outcome; her sincerity did nothing to save her.

Historically, the moral attached to this particular version of the fable is that innocence and logic are no defense against a tyrant or an adversary who acts as both judge and executioner.

morables_82,"Be quiet now, said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap. If you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf. Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Statement:** The Nurse makes a threat to the child (""I will throw you to the Wolf"") that she does not actually intend to carry out. 
2.  **The External Perspective:** The Wolf hears this threat and takes it as a literal promise or an invitation to a meal.
3.  **The Outcome:** When the child cries, the Wolf expects the Nurse to fulfill her word. Instead, the Nurse protects the child and sets the dogs on the Wolf.

The Wolf’s mistake was believing the words of someone who considered him an enemy. In the tradition of Aesop's fables (this specific story is often titled ""The Wolf and the Nurse""), the lesson focuses on not trusting the words or ""promises"" made by enemies, as they are often deceptive or not meant to be kept in the way the listener hopes.

Looking at the options:
- **A) Enemies' promises were made to be broken:** This aligns with the Wolf being disappointed after believing the Nurse's word.
- **B) Only untrustworthy people blame others:** Not relevant to the plot.
- **C) Cunning plans silence noisy fears:** Not the core lesson.
- **D) Expect no reward for serving the wicked:** The Wolf wasn't serving the Nurse; he was waiting for a meal.
- **E) Harsh words may hide a misguided attempt at protection:** While literally true of the Nurse, the traditional moral of this fable focuses on the folly of the Wolf believing an enemy.

The most traditional and fitting moral for this specific fable is that one should not believe everything they hear, especially from the mouth of an enemy.

Then the fly laughed at the man and said, 'You wanted to avenge the sting of a ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the actions:

1.  **The Conflict:** A bald man hurts himself (the slap) while trying to retaliate against a minor nuisance (the fly).
2.  **The Fly's Mockery:** The fly mocks the man for being willing to kill for a small sting and for hurting himself in the process, suggesting the man is foolish.
3.  **The Man's Defense:** The man distinguishes between his **intent** and the **outcome**. He forgives himself for the slap because his *intent* was not to harm himself, whereas his *intent* toward the fly is calculated and justified (in his mind) because the fly is a parasite.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Intent matters more than the outcome:** This is the core of the man’s argument (""I can easily forgive myself since I know that I did not try to hurt myself on purpose""). This specific version of the fable (attributed to Phaedrus) focuses on the distinction between accidental self-harm and intentional malice.
*   **B) Rudeness/Sharing:** This is not relevant to the plot.
*   **C) Forgiveness outshines mockery:** While the man forgives himself, the story's climax is his justification of his intent to kill the fly, not a general lesson on the beauty of forgiveness.
*   **D) Frustrated self-effort:** This is too vague.
*   **E) In anger, we may cause ourselves more harm:** This is a common moral associated with similar fables, but the man's dialogue specifically refutes this by prioritizing his intent and his willingness to suffer ""greater inconvenience"" to eliminate a nuisance.

The man’s response serves to define the moral: we judge ourselves by our intentions, and we are willing to endure self-inflicted hardship to deal with genuine enemies. The distinction between an accidental blow and an intentional sting is the central theme.

The Hunter agreed, but said: 'If you desire to conquer the Stag, you mus",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Motivation:** The Horse is driven by a desire for revenge against the Stag. This personal grudge clouds his judgment.
2.  **The Sacrifice:** To achieve his goal, the Horse accepts the Hunter's help. However, this help comes with conditions: the Horse must accept a bit, reins, and a saddle. In doing so, he voluntarily surrenders his physical autonomy.
3.  **The Short-term Gain:** The Horse achieves his immediate goal—defeating the Stag.
4.  **The Long-term Consequence:** Once the enemy is defeated, the Horse realizes he cannot return to his former state of freedom. By giving the Hunter power over him to serve his own ends, he has provided the Hunter with the means to enslave him permanently.

**Analyzing the Options:**
*   **A:** Captures the transactional nature of the mistake but focuses more on the Hunter's intent than the Horse's loss of liberty.
*   **B:** While the story deals with power, it is more about the specific danger of seeking revenge at the cost of freedom.
*   **C:** This refers to the Hunter's actions, but the story is a cautionary tale for the Horse.
*   **D:** Focuses on the fleeting nature of vengeance, which is a secondary theme.
*   **E:** This is the most accurate summary of the Horse's plight. The Horse sought ""guidance"" and ""aid"" to settle a score, but the price of that aid was his permanent freedom. He traded his independence for a moment of triumph.

Traditional interpretations of this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Horse, the Hunter, and the Stag"") emphasize that in seeking to satisfy a grudge through the power of a superior, one often falls into a state of servitude that is far worse than the original injury.

1.  **The Cat’s Actions:** The cat wants the eel but doesn't want to get wet. He first tries flattery (""O most beautiful bird!"") to get the stork to open her mouth and drop the fish. When that fails, he switches to insults (""wretched creature,"" ""filthy bird"") to provoke a reaction. Both tactics are designed to make the stork open her beak.
2.  **The Stork’s Actions:** The stork recognizes that if she responds to the cat—whether to accept the praise or defend herself against the insults—she will drop her prize. She remains silent and keeps walking, focusing entirely on her goal (keeping and eating her meal).
3.  **The Conflict:** The cat tries to distract the stork with ""cunning, deceptive words"" (flattery) and then with provocation.
4.  **The Lesson:** The stork succeeds because she refuses to be distracted by outside noise, insults, or flattery. She stays focused on her objective despite the cat's attempts to derail her.

While options D and E describe the cat's behavior (flattery and deception), the story's outcome highlights the **stork's success through her persistence and refusal to be distracted**. The stork's silence in the face of both praise and insults demonstrates her unwavering focus on her goal.

*   **A) Take what you can get when you can get it:** This directly reflects the wolf's mistake. He had a meal and let it go based on a promise of something better, only to end up with nothing. This is a classic Aesop-style moral regarding missed opportunities.
*   **B) Liberty:** While the dog is free, the story focuses more on the trickery and the wolf's foolishness than the abstract value of liberty.
*   **C) The cunning prey on the gullible:** This is close, but the story is specifically about timing and seizing an opportunity rather than general predation.
*   **D) Cunning enemies' persuasive promises...:** This focuses on the nature of the dog, but in this fable, the primary takeaway is usually the folly of the wolf for delaying his gain.
*   **E) A plea for mercy...:** The dog's plea wasn't merely for mercy; it was a calculated lie to escape.

In the context of Aesop’s Fables (this story is often titled ""The Dog and the Wolf""), the moral is that a wise person (or animal) does not let go of a certain benefit in the hope of a greater, uncertain one. Thus, the wolf should have taken what he had when he had it.

morables_222,"A gnat happened to land on the back of a camel and lingered there on top of the baggage. When he finally decided to disembark, he said, 'I will let myself down now as fast as I can so as not to burden",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interaction between the gnat and the camel:

1.  **The Gnat's Perspective:** The gnat believes his presence is a significant ""burden"" to the camel. He behaves with a sense of self-importance, assuming that his departure will provide the camel with noticeable relief.
2.  **The Camel's Perspective:** The camel, being much larger and carrying heavy baggage, did not even feel the gnat land and does not feel any lighter when the gnat leaves.
3.  **The Core Conflict:** There is a disconnect between how important the gnat thinks he is and how important he actually is to the camel. The gnat overestimates his impact on his environment.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the eyes of their neighbors.** This directly addresses the gnat’s inflated self-importance versus the camel's indifference.
*   **B) Arrogant fools have no true influence.** While true in a sense, the gnat isn't necessarily trying to exert ""influence"" or power; he is misjudging his physical weight/importance.
*   **C) Patience sees beyond the insignificant.** The story is less about the camel's patience and more about the gnat's vanity.
*   **D) A patient, discerning person is made wise...** This is overly complex and misinterprets the camel's reaction as a learning process.
*   **E) Even the smallest presence can go unnoticed...** While factually true in the story, morals of fables usually focus on human character (vanity/ego) rather than just physical scale.

Option A is the classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Gnat and the Camel"" or ""The Gnat and the Bull""), highlighting that small people often puff themselves up as being more important than others perceive them to be.

The fox turned to the women and said, 'What shouts there would be aga",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the fox and the old woman:

1.  **The Situation:** The women are eating roasted chickens in peace and silence. The fox observes this and feels there is a double standard: if he were to eat those same chickens, people would shout and dogs would hunt him.
2.  **The Conflict:** The fox believes the action (eating chickens) is the same regardless of who does it, and thus the reaction should be the same.
3.  **The Resolution:** The old woman points out the fundamental difference: the women own the chickens (""those things which are ours""), whereas the fox's access to chickens involves theft (""you take your pleasure in things that belong to others"").
4.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches that rights and permissions depend on ownership and legality. An action that is perfectly acceptable for an owner is a crime for a thief. Therefore, a stranger or an outsider cannot assume they have the right to treat someone else's property the same way the owner does.

Looking at the options:
- **A** directly addresses the distinction between what an owner is permitted to do and what an outsider is allowed to do.
- **B, C, D, and E** focus on ""silence"" or ""malice,"" which are incidental details of the story rather than the central point of the old woman's rebuttal regarding property rights.

morables_245,"A viper entered a blacksmith's workshop and bit the file, testing it to see if this was something she could eat. The file protested fiercely, 'You fool! Why are you trying to wound me with your teeth,",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the viper and the file:

1.  **The Characters:** A viper (a soft creature that attacks with teeth/venom) and a file (a tool made of hardened steel designed to wear down other metals).
2.  **The Action:** The viper attempts to bite the file, treating it as if it were prey or something it could damage.
3.  **The Result/Reaction:** The file points out the absurdity of the attack. Not only is the file impervious to the viper's teeth, but its very nature is to destroy the very material (iron/metal) that the viper is trying to bite.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates the futility of trying to hurt or influence someone who is ""harder"" or more resistant than the attacker. An ""insensible"" object (or a person with an impenetrable constitution) cannot be harmed by the petty attacks of those weaker than them; rather, the attacker only risks hurting themselves.

Looking at the options:
- **A) It is useless attacking the insensible.** This aligns perfectly with the idea that the file (an insensible, hard object) cannot be harmed by the viper’s bite.
- **B)** deals with seeking help, which is not relevant.
- **C)** deals with curiosity, but the focus here is on the power dynamic and the futility of the attack.
- **D)** deals with forgiveness, which is not mentioned.
- **E)** deals with boasting, but the viper started the conflict, not the file's boasting.

In many classic editions of Aesop's Fables, the moral of ""The Viper and the File"" is explicitly stated as: ""It is useless attacking those who can bite back harder,"" or more commonly, ""It is useless attacking the insensible.""

As they were disputing, they passed a statue carv",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the Man and the Lion step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** Both characters are boasting about their own superiority. This establishes a dispute over who is truly the more powerful ""hero"" or species.
2.  **The Evidence:** The Man presents a statue as ""proof"" of human superiority. This statue shows a Man defeating a Lion.
3.  **The Counter-Argument:** The Lion points out a fundamental flaw in the evidence: the source. The statue was created by a human. If a lion had been the artist, the scene depicted would be the exact opposite.
4.  **The Core Lesson:** The story highlights that ""truth"" or ""superiority"" often depends on who is telling the story. Every account is colored by the perspective, bias, and interests of the narrator. Until you hear the other side (or consider the source), you are only seeing a one-sided representation of reality.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) One story is good, till another is told:** This directly matches the Lion's point. The Man’s ""story"" (the statue) seemed definitive until the Lion provided the perspective of how a different storyteller would portray the same subject.
*   **B) The hero is brave in deeds...:** The story is about perspective and bias, not the physical bravery of the characters.
*   **C, D, E) Pride...:** While both characters are prideful, the climax of the story rests on the Lion's observation about the **origin of the record** (the statue), rather than the characters' downfall due to pride or lack of cooperation.

Therefore, the moral is that perspective shapes the narrative.

On his way to the assembly of the birds, the peaco",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the motivations of the characters:

1.  **The Vulnerability/Flaw:** The peacock is described as gentle and courteous, but he agrees to give away his essential feathers in exchange for having his ""praises squawked throughout the courts."" This indicates a desire for status, recognition, and the ego-stroke of being praised (vanity).
2.  **The Transaction:** The other birds (raven, crow, etc.) appeal to the peacock's desire for fame. By trading his physical protection (feathers) for empty words of praise, he prioritizes his public image over his survival and his responsibilities.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he gave everything away to satisfy his vanity and the opportunistic requests of others, he lost the ability to protect himself and his chicks. When winter (hardship) arrived, his lack of substance (the feathers he gave away) led to his death.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) Vanity can lead to self-destruction:** This fits perfectly. The peacock's desire for praise led him to give away the very things he needed to survive.
*   **B) Do not boast...:** The peacock didn't boast; he fell for the boasts/promises of others.
*   **C) Opportunism...:** While the other birds were opportunistic, the story's focus is on the peacock’s tragic choice and the resulting death, making the peacock's flaw the primary lesson.
*   **D) Sorrow not...:** The peacock did not choose to abandon his feathers for resilience; he lost them through poor judgment and died.
*   **E) True beauty...:** The story ends in death and tragedy, suggesting that his ""kindness"" in giving away his feathers was actually a foolish sacrifice driven by a desire for praise.

The story warns that trading one's essential needs for the sake of reputation and praise is a fatal mistake.

You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth as a w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events:
1.  **The Conflict:** The tiny Gnat challenges the mighty Lion, claiming he is stronger. 
2.  **The Victory:** Through small size and agility, the Gnat outmaneuvers the Lion, causing the Lion to injure himself in frustration. The Gnat is triumphant.
3.  **The Fall:** While celebrating his victory and bragging (buzzing a song of triumph), the Gnat fails to see a minor threat—a spider’s web—and is killed by an ""inconsiderable"" insect.
4.  **The Reflection:** The Gnat laments that after defeating the ""hugest beasts,"" he is killed by something small and insignificant.

**Analysis of the Options:**
- **A) No matter how you brag, you can be undone.** This aligns with the transition from the Gnat's triumph/bragging to his sudden downfall. It emphasizes that no one is invincible, regardless of their past victories.
- **B)** Incorrect: The Lion was not humble or supplicating.
- **C)** Pride turning triumph into *frustration* only describes the Lion's half of the story, not the Gnat's ultimate fate (which was death, not just frustration).
- **D)** This is a distracter; while the Gnat used cunning, the story focuses more on his sudden downfall following his success.
- **E)** While true in the first half of the story, it doesn't account for the Gnat’s defeat by the spider.

The core lesson is that overconfidence and bragging after a victory often lead to a lack of vigilance, allowing even the smallest danger to destroy you. Option A best encapsulates this ""pride comes before a fall"" narrative.

All of a sudden a tuna fish",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events provided in the fable:

1.  **Preparation and Effort:** The fishermen worked hard (""struggled for a long time"") but failed to catch anything using their professional skills.
2.  **Despair:** They gave up because their own efforts were insufficient.
3.  **The Event:** A tuna leaped into the boat, not because of the fishermen's skill, but because it was fleeing a predator. 
4.  **The Outcome:** They succeeded in their goal (obtaining a fish) through a stroke of pure chance/fortune.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A:** Directly addresses the contrast between ""skill"" (which failed the fishermen) and ""luck"" (which provided the fish). This is the traditional moral associated with this Aesop's fable.
*   **B:** Relates to the size of the fish, but the story is about the fishermen's fortune, not the tuna's social status.
*   **C:** Describes the emotional shift but doesn't capture the causative lesson of the story.
*   **D:** This is a grammatically incoherent or irrelevant statement.
*   **E:** The fishermen actually stopped persevering and were turning back when the luck occurred; perseverance was not what rewarded them.

The story highlights that sometimes, despite our best efforts failing, a random stroke of luck provides what hard work could not.

Not withstanding all his prayers, instead of becoming richer, he got poorer. Out ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Action:** A man prays to a wooden idol for wealth, but his situation worsens.
2.  **The Turning Point:** In a fit of anger and impatience, he destroys the idol (an act of disrespect/rejection of his former belief).
3.  **The Outcome:** The destruction of the idol reveals hidden gold.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The man immediately changes his perspective on the idol. While he previously treated it as a deity to be worshipped, he now views it as a ""graceless deity"" that only responds to ""force.""

**Analysis of the Options:**
- **A) People adjust their beliefs based on what is profitable for them:** This aligns perfectly with the man’s behavior. He worshipped the idol when he thought it would bring him luck, and once he found success through violence/rejection, he justified his actions by changing his view of the idol's nature to suit his new situation.
- **B)** This mentions ""ugly things as if they were beautiful,"" which is not the focus here.
- **C) Impatience can lead to graceless outcomes:** While he was impatient, the outcome was actually ""graceful"" (he got the gold), contradicting the narrative.
- **D)** This is a nonsensical phrase in the context of the story.
- **E) Fortune favors the bold who challenge fate:** While the man was ""bold"" in breaking the idol, the core of the fable (Commonly attributed to Aesop) focuses more on the irony of human nature and the transactional/fickle nature of his devotion.

In the tradition of Aesop's fables, this specific story (The Man and the Wooden God) is often used to illustrate that some people only respect or recognize what benefits them, or that their ""faith"" is entirely dependent on profit.

Then the little gnat said to the bull, 'It's enough for me that you have accepted my ch",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Interaction:** A small, weak creature (the gnat) challenges a powerful, superior creature (the bull) to a contest of strength.
2.  **The Result of Acceptance:** By simply accepting the challenge, the bull validates the gnat. The gnat claims equality not because he won a physical fight, but because the bull acknowledged him as a worthy adversary.
3.  **The Gnat's Reaction:** The gnat uses the bull's acknowledgment to boast and gain social status (""sported for the crowd"").
4.  **The Narrative Commentary:** The text explicitly states that if the bull had ignored the gnat (""dismissed this opponent as beneath contempt""), the gnat would have had nothing to boast about. 

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) People who enter into contests with unworthy opponents lower their own reputation:** This aligns perfectly with the text. The bull's mistake was engaging with someone far below his level, which allowed the gnat to claim equality.
*   **B) Educate your children...:** Irrelevant to the story's themes.
*   **C) Pride invites downfall:** While the gnat is prideful, he is not punished; rather, he ""wins"" socially. The bull doesn't experience a physical ""downfall,"" just a loss of dignity.
*   **D) Return boastful favors...:** The logic of this sentence does not apply to the conflict described.
*   **E) Pride can lead to futile contests:** While true, it doesn't capture the specific nuance of the bull's loss of status by acknowledging an inferior.

The core lesson is that acknowledging an unworthy challenger grants them a status they haven't earned, thereby diminishing your own.

The owner began to question the dog, asking how he could be so ungra",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue between the owner and the dog:

1.  **The Owner’s Defense:** The owner claims he is ""kind"" because he never personally struck the dog or spoke harshly to him. He views his own goodness based strictly on his personal physical actions.
2.  **The Dog’s Rebuttal:** The dog points out that while the owner didn't physically do the deed, he ""had others do it"" for him. The dog correctly identifies that the order came from the owner, making the owner responsible for the pain.
3.  **The Core Lesson:** The dog concludes that being beaten by the owner's order is the same as being beaten by the owner himself. This highlights the concept of mediated responsibility—if you delegate a task (especially a cruel one), you are still the author of that action.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the dog's argument: delegating an action to another does not absolve the original person of the deed.
*   **B)** While the owner is hypocritical, the story focuses more on delegated actions than ""wicked words.""
*   **C)** The story actually suggests the owner *wasn't* truly kind, so the dog's lack of ""appreciation"" is justified.
*   **D)** This refers to safety and danger, whereas the story is about accountability.
*   **E)** This is a literal plot point (the markings leading to the reunion), but not the moral lesson regarding the dog's reason for leaving.

1.  **Indifference to Common Danger:** When the butcher enters, the sheep ignore him. Even as he begins taking individuals to be slaughtered, the remaining sheep console themselves with the fact that it is not *them* currently being taken (""He keeps his hands off me... let him take whom he takes"").
2.  **Lack of Unity:** The sheep fail to realize that the threat to one is a threat to the entire flock. They do not act collectively when they have the numerical advantage.
3.  **The Result of Inaction:** Eventually, only one sheep remains. Having sat by while the rest of the flock was decimated, there is no one left to help or join him in resistance.
4.  **The Final Realization:** The last sheep admits their mistake: they should have acted when they were ""all together.""

**Analyzing the Options:**
- **A) If you don't speak out for others, there will be nobody left to speak out for you.** This mirrors the theme of the story perfectly. It highlights the consequence of failing to provide mutual support against a common enemy until everyone has been picked off individually. This is famously echoed in Martin Niemöller's ""First they came..."" poem.
- **B)** This refers to the fable of the frogs asking for a king; it doesn't apply here.
- **C)** While they eventually face the truth, the core lesson is about collective action and mutual protection, not just abstract wisdom.
- **D)** This refers to witty repartée; the sheep were not being insulted, they were being killed.
- **E)** The sheep weren't trying to ""fit in"" with the butcher; they were ignoring his presence.

1.  **The Action:** A hooligan commits a reckless, hostile act (hitting Aesop with a stone).
2.  **The Reinforcement:** Instead of punishing him immediately, Aesop rewards him with a coin and praise (""Well done!""). This gives the hooligan a false sense of success and validation.
3.  **The Escalation:** Emboldened by his ""success"" and the promise of a larger reward, the hooligan repeats the reckless behavior against a person of higher status/power.
4.  **The Outcome:** The hooligan is caught and executed.

The story illustrates how immediate reward or ""success"" in wrongdoing encourages a person to continue on a dangerous path, which eventually leads to their downfall. The hooligan was ""led astray"" by the small reward Aesop gave him, thinking his behavior was profitable, when in reality it was leading him toward ruin.

*   **Option A** directly addresses this: The hooligan's initial ""success"" (getting the coin) led him astray, ultimately causing his ruin.
*   **Option B** is incorrect as the hooligan didn't ""wish"" for something that backfired; he acted out of greed and aggression.
*   **Option C** is close because Aesop is clever, but the focus of the fable is on the fate of the aggressor, not ""reckless wealth.""
*   **Option D** focuses on ""manipulative pursuits,"" which describes Aesop's actions, but the moral of a fable usually focuses on the lesson learned by (or from) the character who meets a tragic end.
*   **Option E** is incorrect because Aesop's response was not ""grace""—it was a calculated trick to ensure the hooligan was punished.

Therefore, the most accurate moral is that initial success in bad behavior leads to eventual destruction.

1.  **Winter's Argument:** Winter boasts about its power, comparing itself to a ""dictator or a despot."" Winter takes pride in its ability to make people ""tremble"" and force them into submission (staying indoors and looking at the ground). This represents leadership or power based on **fear and coercion**.
2.  **Spring’s Argument:** Spring points out that because Winter rules through fear and discomfort, people are ""glad to get rid of"" it. In contrast, Spring is welcomed with joy; people seek it out and think fondly of it when it is gone. This represents a presence based on **love and appreciation**.
3.  **The Conflict:** The story contrasts the ""despotic"" nature of Winter with the ""pleasant"" nature of Spring. The conclusion of the dialogue emphasizes that while Winter can control people's movements through fear, Spring wins their hearts and loyalty.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) It is better to be loved than feared.** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between Winter’s boast of being a ""despot"" and Spring’s rebuttal that people are ""glad to get rid"" of a tyrant but give thanks for a pleasant friend.
*   **B)** There is no mention of misplaced blame.
*   **C)** While the story shows two types of power, the lesson focuses on which form is superior/preferable to the subjects.
*   **D)** The story is not about ""unappreciative"" hands; the people appreciate Spring very much.
*   **E)** Winter does not claim beauty, only the ability to frighten.

4.  **The Explanation:** A bystander notes that it is human nature to be particularly fond of the ""newest arrival,"" even if it hasn’t earned that devotion.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Everything pleases at first...** – While the story touches on the novelty of things, it focuses more on the *valuation* of the new over the worthy, rather than the eventual boredom with things.
*   **B) Satisfied with lot in life...** – This is irrelevant to the soldier's choice to favor one horse over another.
*   **C) Beauty fades...** – The new horse is described as *not* beautiful, so this doesn't fit the context.
*   **D) The inferior word of a wicked man...** – There is no mention of wickedness or honesty in this fable.
*   **E) We value what is less worthy more than what truly deserves our care.** – This directly mirrors the soldier's behavior. He neglects the ""excellent"" horse (which deserves care) in favor of the ""inferior"" horse simply because it is new. It highlights the human tendency to be distracted by novelty at the expense of true quality.

The story serves as a critique of prioritizing the new and inferior over the established and superior.

morables_423,"A seagull having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die. A Kite saw him and exclaimed: 'You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no bus",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the fable step by step:

1.  **Analyze the action:** A seagull (a bird) attempts to eat something that is physically too large for it (greedy/ambitious behavior) and leaves its natural ""element"" (the air) to hunt in the sea.
2.  **Analyze the consequence:** The seagull physically harms itself and dies because it tried to do something outside of its capacity or natural role.
3.  **Analyze the Kite's commentary:** The Kite points out that the seagull suffered because it acted outside of its station (""a bird of the air has no business to seek its food from the sea"").
4.  **Evaluate the options:**
    *   **A) Every man should be content to mind his own business:** This aligns with the Kite’s observation that the seagull should have stayed within its own domain or ""business"" as a bird of the air. Historically, in Aesop's fables, ""minding one's own business"" refers to staying within one's natural sphere or limitations.
    *   **B) Learn from past misfortunes:** The seagull dies, so it cannot learn from this misfortune.
    *   **C) Greed breeds misfortune...:** While the seagull was ""greedy"" in bolting a large fish, this specific version of the fable focuses heavily on the seagull acting outside its natural sphere.
    *   **D) How often do we supply...:** This refers to providing enemies with weapons, which does not happen here.
    *   **E) Patience is key:** The story is about limitation and nature, not patience.

In classical interpretations of this specific fable (The Seagull and the Kite), the lesson is that one should stay within their own sphere of life or nature.

morables_145,"There were once some foxes who had gathered together on the banks of the River Meander looking for a drink of water. They urged one another to approach the river, but no one dared to get too close bec",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this fable (historically attributed to Aesop), let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of foxes is thirsty and cautious of a dangerous, rushing river.
2.  **The Conflict:** One fox, driven by vanity and the desire to ""embarrass her fellow foxes,"" mocks their caution as cowardice.
3.  **The Action:** To prove her superiority and boast of her bravery, she leaps into the water, ignoring the actual danger of the current.
4.  **The Consequence:** The current is too strong, and she is swept away.
5.  **The Cover-up:** Realizing she is in a life-threatening situation and has failed, she makes up an excuse (carrying a message to Miletus) to hide the fact that she is helpless and dying.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The fox’s boastful nature and desire to show off led her to ignore a fatal danger, resulting in her being swept away.
*   **B:** There is no ""profit"" or ""greed"" involved; the motivation is social status/bravado.
*   **C & E:** These suggest her boldness was a positive or necessary trait, but the story treats her actions as foolish and her ""courage"" as a fatal error. 
*   **D:** While she was mocking others, ""bad neighbors"" isn't the primary theme; it's the vanity of the individual.

The fable illustrates that those who boast or act recklessly to show off often find themselves in over their heads, often trying to maintain their pride even as they face the consequences of their folly.

1.  **The Lion's Dilemma:** The lion wants to appear fair but cannot suppress his natural predatory instinct.
2.  **The First Trap:** He creates a ""no-win"" situation. Those who speak the truth (the breath smells bad) are killed. Those who lie/flatter (the breath does not smell bad) are also killed.
3.  **The Monkey's Attempt:** The monkey tries extreme flattery (""smelled of cinnamon""), hoping this will save him where others failed.
4.  **The Result:** Despite the monkey's clever flattery, the lion simply changes his tactics (faking illness) to justify eating the monkey anyway.

Analysis of the options:
*   **A:** This is the most accurate. The story illustrates that when a predator (or a tyrant) is determined to satisfy their appetite/will, the specific words or actions of the victim do not matter. Whether they were honest, dishonest, or silent, the outcome remained the same.
*   **B:** There are no ""old friends"" mentioned.
*   **C:** This describes the lion's behavior, but the story focuses more on the futility of the victims' responses.
*   **D:** This is a variation of a moral for ""The Donkey in the Lion's Skin"" and doesn't fit the plot.
*   **E:** This is a literal interpretation of the lion's *pretended* goal, which he ultimately fails to uphold.

The central theme is that for those under the power of a deceptive predator, there is no ""correct"" thing to say to ensure safety.

The partridge immediately started squawking his usual song, sauntering through every room in the house un",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the behavior of the characters and the conflict between them.

1.  **The Partridge's Behavior:** The partridge is a newcomer to the house. Despite being there for only a day, he immediately makes himself at home by ""sauntering through every room"" and ""squawking"" or ""cackling"" loudly. He exhibits a sense of entitlement and bold confidence in a space he does not yet know.
2.  **The Weasel's Argument:** The weasel (traditionally a predator, but here acting as an established resident) questions the partridge's right to be so loud. The weasel’s point is based on residency and social hierarchy: the weasel has lived there for generations and remains quiet and respectful (""sleeps beside the hearth""), while the newcomer has immediately begun to disturb the peace.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the clash between a boisterous newcomer and a disciplined long-term resident. The weasel’s rebuke serves as a warning that one should observe and respect the existing order and customs of a new environment before asserting oneself so loudly. In many traditional interpretations of Aesop-style fables, this specific story (Perry Index 575/Phaedrus) illustrates that newcomers should be humble and respectful of their surroundings and those who preceded them.

While ""D"" mentions vanity and destruction, the text focuses more on the breach of social etiquette and the lack of humility shown by the newcomer toward the established household norms.

morables_39,"A fox climbing up over a fence was about to slip and fall, so she reached out and grabbed hold of a bramble bush but the brambles scratched the soft padding of the fox's paws. Stung by the sharp pain,",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A fox is in trouble (falling) and instinctively reaches out to a bramble bush for support.
2.  **The Conflict:** The bramble bush, by its very nature, is covered in thorns. When the fox grabs it, the fox is injured.
3.  **The Confrontation:** The fox blames the bush for being ""cruel"" and failing to help as intended.
4.  **The Resolution/Lesson:** The bramble bush points out the fox's error in judgment. It is in the bramble's nature to catch, snag, and scratch; therefore, expecting it to provide a soft, supportive landing is a misunderstanding of the bramble's inherent character.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) It is foolish to expect help from someone who is naturally unkind:** This accurately reflects the lesson. The bramble is ""naturally"" harmful to touch, and the fox was foolish to expect a different outcome. 
*   **B) No one should boast...:** This does not apply, as there is no boasting in the story.
*   **C) Cruelty stings the sharpest:** While poetic, this is a description of the pain, not the underlying moral lesson about expectations.
*   **D) A single sharp skill...:** This relates to a different Aesop's fable (The Fox and the Cat).
*   **E) In seeking support, be mindful of the harm it may cause:** While this is a logical takeaway, traditional interpretations of this specific fable focus on the **character** of the entity being asked for help (the danger of relying on those whose nature it is to do harm).

In Aesop's fables, this story (The Fox and the Bramble) serves as a warning against seeking assistance from those who are inherently prone to causing injury or who are ""prickly"" by nature.

But the fuller told him, 'How on earth would I be able to carr",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s look at the roles and actions of the characters:

1.  **The Characters:** A charcoal burner (whose trade involves black soot and dirt) and a fuller (whose trade involves cleaning and whitening cloth).
2.  **The Conflict:** The charcoal burner proposes living together, but the fuller realizes that the fundamental nature of their work makes this impossible. The charcoal burner’s byproduct (soot) would actively destroy the fuller's hard work (whitening).
3.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that certain things (or people) are fundamentally mismatched because their natures, goals, or lifestyles are in direct opposition. Proximity between such opposites leads to the ruin of the one by the other.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Opposites are utterly incompatible.** This fits perfectly. The soot and the clean cloth cannot occupy the same space without the soot ruining the cloth. 
*   **B) Appearances can be deceiving.** This is not relevant here; the issue is functional incompatibility, not misleading appearances.
*   **C, D, and E)** While they touch on ideas of caution or understanding, they do not capture the core ""nature of the trade"" conflict presented in the fable.

In traditional translations of Aesop's fables, this specific story is used to teach that ""like should associate with like"" and that attempting to combine incompatible elements results in failure.

morables_446,"A robber had murdered someone along the road. When the bystanders began to chase him, he dropped the bloody corpse and ran away. Some travellers coming from the opposite direction asked the man how he",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events step by step:

1.  **The Crime and the Deception:** A murderer is caught with bloody hands. To avoid capture and blame, he lies to passersby, claiming the stains came from a mulberry tree (implying the juice of the fruit). 
2.  **The Slander:** By making this claim, he is essentially blaming an innocent entity (the tree) for the evidence of his crime. 
3.  **The Consequence:** When the murderer is caught, he is executed specifically on a mulberry tree.
4.  **The Resolution:** The tree speaks, noting that it has no problem assisting in the execution because the man tried to ""smear"" its reputation by attributing his own crime to it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This matches the story's conclusion. The mulberry tree (representing a ""honest"" or innocent entity) does not hesitate to participate in the ""persecution"" (execution) of the man who slandered it. In Aesop's fables, even inanimate objects or nature often react against those who try to blame them for their own wicked deeds.
*   **B)** Equanimity is not the focus; the tree is actively vengeful/justified, not indifferent.
*   **C)** Curiosity isn't what unmasks him; his pursuers do.
*   **D)** The story isn't about greed for honor; it’s about a failed attempt to deflect guilt.
*   **E)** While true in a general sense, the specific interaction between the murderer's lie and the tree's reaction points more directly to the consequences of slandering others to save oneself.

In the classic Greek collections of Aesop's fables (Perry Index 170), the moral explicitly states that even naturally good or ""honest"" people/things will turn against those who try to pin their own crimes on them.

The lion woke up and immediately grabbed the wretched little mouse with his paw,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central theme:

1.  **The Act of Mercy:** The lion (a powerful creature) shows mercy to the mouse (a tiny creature), even though the mouse is insignificant to him. The lion believes there is no ""glory"" in killing something so small, so he performs a random act of kindness.
2.  **The Reversal of Fortune:** Later, the mighty lion is trapped and helpless.
3.  **The Repayment:** The mouse, remembering the lion's kindness, uses its ""small"" abilities (gnawing at cords) to save the great lion.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The lion’s ""small"" mercy towards a tiny animal resulted in his own life being saved later.
*   **B) Unequal matches bring misery:** The story shows the opposite; the ""unequal"" match resulted in a life-saving alliance.
*   **C) Cleverness can free the trapped:** While the mouse was clever/skilled at gnawing, the core lesson is about the *reciprocity of kindness*, not just problem-solving.
*   **D) Those who act in their own innocent self-interest...:** This contradicts the story, as the mouse acted out of genuine gratitude.
*   **E) Even the smallest actions can awaken great consequences:** While true, this is a broad statement. Option A specifically captures the *moral* relationship between the characters (kindness and gratitude).

The classic Aesop's fable ""The Lion and the Mouse"" is the source of the famous proverb: ""No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.""

1.  **The Threat:** The Pigeons are afraid of a Kite (a bird of prey), though the text implies the Kite's impact is relatively limited (sampling a few over a year).
2.  **The Solution:** To protect themselves, they invite a Hawk (a much more efficient and deadly predator) into their home to act as a guardian.
3.  **The Outcome:** The Hawk, now having easy access to the Pigeons, kills more of them in a single day than the original threat (the Kite) would have in an entire year.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A) Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease:** This aligns perfectly with the plot. The ""disease"" was the threat of the Kite, and the ""remedy"" was the Hawk. The remedy caused significantly more damage than the original problem.
*   **B), C), and D):** These refer to specific themes (wickedness, deception, or legal logic) that are not the primary focus of this specific fable. While the Hawk is deceptive, the core lesson is about the catastrophic result of the Pigeons' choice of ""help.""
*   **E) In seeking protection, choose allies wisely...:** While this is a plausible lesson, it is a broader interpretation. Classic Aesop’s Fables are traditionally summarized by the specific warning against a ""cure"" being worse than the ""illness.""

In the context of traditional Aesopian morals, ""Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease"" (or ""The remedy is worse than the disease"") is the standard lesson for ""The Pigeons and the Kite"" (sometimes titled ""The Pigeons and the Hawk"").

morables_394,"When Zeus had fashioned man and woman, he ordered Hermes to take them to Gaia, the Earth, and to show them how to obtain food by digging in the ground. At first, the Earth refused to cooperate in Herm",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Directive:** Zeus creates humans and intends for them to survive by farming/digging the Earth.
2.  **The Conflict:** Earth (Gaia) is reluctant to allow humans to scar and exploit her for food.
3.  **The Resolution:** Hermes compels Earth to follow Zeus's orders.
4.  **The Consequence (The Moral Core):** Earth relents but attaches a curse: humans may take what they need to survive (the gain), but the process will be defined by ""groans and tears"" (the cost).

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Easy gains often come with hidden costs and hardships.** This aligns with the ending. While humans gain the ability to feed themselves, it is not ""easy"" (it requires digging/toil) and it comes with an inherent cost of suffering. In the context of the fable, the ""gain"" of survival is inextricably linked to the ""cost"" of labor and sorrow.
*   **B) Do not fight with those who are perfectly capable of fighting back.** This isn't the focus; the humans aren't fighting Earth, and Hermes (representing power) successfully compels her.
*   **C) Power can sway the reluctant.** While true in a literal sense (Hermes sways Earth), fables typically use narrative actions to comment on the human condition rather than just the mechanics of power.
*   **D) Powerful physical stature does not guarantee wisdom.** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) Guidance is the seed of self-sufficiency.** While Hermes provides guidance, the story’s emphasis is on the grim nature of the resulting toil, not the triumph of independence.

The story serves as a mythological explanation for why human life—specifically agriculture and survival—is characterized by hard labor and suffering. It underscores that obtaining what we need from the world is never free and involves a heavy price.

So if you eve",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Event:** A dog steals meat (a heart) from a butcher.
2.  **The Butcher's Reaction:** Instead of simply being angry at the loss, the butcher reflects on the experience. He uses a play on words, noting that while the dog literally took an animal's heart, the butcher ""took heart"" (gained courage or wisdom/insight) from the event.
3.  **The Lesson:** The butcher acknowledges he was caught off guard, but he has learned from the experience. He is now vigilant and warns the dog that he will be prepared for a future attempt.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Experience teaches valuable lessons and encourages caution:** This fits perfectly. The butcher explicitly states he has learned a lesson from the theft, implying he will be more cautious and prepared in the future.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** While the dog acted according to its nature, the focus of the fable's dialogue is on the butcher's newfound wisdom.
*   **C) Boldness without caution leads astray:** This might apply to the dog if he were caught, but the dog actually succeeded in the moment. The moral focus is on the observer (the butcher).
*   **D) Better to face a bold danger...:** This relates to other Aesop fables (like those involving wolves and sheep) but doesn't fit the butcher's reaction here.
*   **E) Desire can lead to actions that betray trust:** There was no established trust between a stray dog and a butcher to begin with.

The story highlights that setbacks or negative experiences provide ""lessons"" that make a person wiser and more guarded against future trouble.

When he saw a hard-working bull who was pulling a plow, the bullock said to him, 'You poor",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** A young bullock, who lives a life of leisure and has never worked (no yoke), mocks an older, hardworking bull for his difficult labor.
2.  **The Reversal:** When the time for a sacrifice arrives, the hardworking bull is set free to rest in the pasture because he has fulfilled his duty. The idle bullock, who was kept ""loose"" and well-fed specifically because he was being raised for slaughter, is led away to be killed.
3.  **The Lesson:** The bullock's initial pride and pity for the elder bull were misplaced. His lack of ""burden"" was actually a sign of his impending doom, while the elder's ""hard work"" secured his continued life and eventual rest. The elder bull gets the final word as the bullock faces the consequence of his idleness.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) He laughs best that laughs last:** This fits perfectly. The bullock laughed at the bull initially, but the situation reversed entirely at the end, leaving the bull in safety while the bullock faced death.
*   **B) The great do not always prevail:** This does not apply, as the ""greatness"" of the characters is not the focus.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers youthful naivety:** While true in a general sense, the story is specifically about the irony of the bullock's mockery. 
*   **D) He that is neither...:** This is nonsensical in the context of this fable.
*   **E) One should not judge others...:** While applicable, it misses the specific ""reversal of fortune"" and ""final outcome"" element that characterizes this Aesop-style fable.

In many classical collections of Aesop's Fables, this story (The Bullock and the Ox) is explicitly paired with the moral: ""He laughs best who laughs last,"" or ""Idleness leads to destruction.""

1.  **The Situation:** A monkey is being saved by a dolphin who mistakes him for a human.
2.  **The Flaw:** Instead of simply being grateful for the rescue, the monkey attempts to impress the dolphin by pretending to be an influential Athenian citizen. 
3.  **The Lie:** When asked about Piraeus (a famous harbor), the monkey mistakenly identifies it as a person who is a ""near and dear friend,"" proving he is lying about his origins and status.
4.  **The Consequence:** The dolphin, recognizing the deception, stops helping and drowns the monkey.

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) Those who pretend to be what they are not, sooner or later, find themselves in deep water:** This fits perfectly. It uses a play on words (""deep water"" can mean both a literal drowning and a difficult situation) to describe how the monkey's pretension led to his demise.
*   **B) Often there is more good to be found in one man than in a crowd of people:** This is irrelevant to the plot of the story.
*   **C) Helpful plans calm infuriation:** The story shows the opposite; the dolphin was helping until he became infuriated by the lie.
*   **D) Telling the truth can sometimes be lying and infuriated dangerous:** This is grammatically confused and logically incorrect based on the text.
*   **E) In times of crisis, companionship can be a source of unexpected strength:** While the dolphin initially provided strength, the moral focus is on the destruction of that companionship through lying.

4.  **The Resolution:** The mice recognize the cat despite the disguise. They have been ""deceived"" or victimized once before (when the cat first entered and started eating them), and as a result, they are now too ""cautious"" to fall for another trick, no matter how clever.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A) He who is once deceived is doubly cautious:** This fits perfectly. The mice, having suffered losses from the cat previously, are now extremely wary and refuse to trust even a seemingly dead cat.
- **B) Beware of when the powerful and the deceitful collaborate:** There is no collaboration here; it is a predator and prey dynamic.
- **C) Caution tempers cunning:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't quite capture the specific element of ""learning from past experience"" which is central to the mice's refusal.
- **D) Relying too much on cunning subordinates...:** There are no subordinates in this story.
- **E) Unchecked problems invite opportunistic solutions:** This focuses more on the house owner than the interaction between the mice and the cat.

The most accurate moral, consistent with traditional interpretations of Aesop's fables (specifically ""The Cat and the Mice""), is that wise people are not fooled by those who have harmed them before.

morables_103,"A Traveler wearied from a long journey lay down, overcome with fatigue, on the very brink of a deep well. Just as he was about to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and wak",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s look at the lesson being taught through the dialogue:

1.  **Analyze the Action:** A traveler chooses to sleep on the edge of a dangerous well. He is saved not by his own wisdom, but by Fortune waking him up.
2.  **Analyze the Speech:** Dame Fortune explicitly states that if the traveler had fallen in, people would have blamed ""bad luck"" or ""fate"" (Fortune) for the accident, even though the accident would have been caused entirely by the traveler's own ""folly"" (choosing a dangerous place to sleep).
3.  **Synthesize the Lesson:** The story highlights that people often blame external circumstances or bad luck for misfortunes that are actually the result of their own poor decisions or negligence. Therefore, the fable teaches that individuals are responsible for their own outcomes.

- **Option A** (Everyone is more or less master of his own fate) aligns perfectly with the idea that our actions, rather than luck, dictate our safety and success.
- **Option B** (Every tale is not to be believed) is irrelevant to the context.
- **Option C** (Guard your energy wisely) is a literal interpretation of his tiredness but misses the philosophical point.
- **Option D** is unrelated to the text.
- **Option E** (Exhaustion can lead to perilous oversight) is a true observation of the plot, but fables traditionally focus on the human tendency to shift blame, which is the core of Fortune's speech.

The most accurate moral according to traditional interpretations of Aesop's fables is that we are responsible for our own misfortunes.

The man took the handle and fitted it to his axe. The",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Request:** A man creates the head of an axe but cannot use it without a handle. He asks his potential victims (the trees) for the means to make his tool functional.
2.  **The Action:** The trees, perhaps thinking they are being helpful or making a minor concession, provide him with the hardest wood (the wild olive) to serve as a handle.
3.  **The Consequence:** By providing the handle, the trees have essentially weaponized their enemy. The man uses the complete axe to destroy the very source of the gift.
4.  **The Realization:** The oak tree recognizes that their own contribution led to their downfall (""It serves us right..."").

**Evaluation of Options:**
*   **A) You should think twice before offering anything to your enemies:** This directly reflects the trees' mistake. By giving the man a handle, they enabled him to destroy them.
*   **B) It is better to be injured with impunity...:** This is a variation of a moral from a different fable (often ""The Eagle and the Fox"") and doesn't quite fit the proactive mistake made here.
*   **C) Generosity without wisdom invites regret:** While true, ""A"" is more specific to the context of aiding someone who intends you harm.
*   **D) and E):** These options introduce philosophical complexities or themes (necessity vs. resolve) not present in this simple cautionary tale.

The primary lesson is that by giving an adversary the means to harm you, you become the architect of your own destruction.

The crab said to her, 'O mother, lead the way, and I will try to walk accordingly.",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Precept:** The mother crab gives her son a command or a ""precept"" regarding how he should behave (walk straight).
2.  **The Challenge:** The son asks the mother to demonstrate the behavior she is demanding.
3.  **The Failure:** The mother is unable to perform the action she preached. She cannot set the example she expects her son to follow.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that it is easy to give instructions or criticize others, but it is much harder to model that behavior oneself. If a leader or parent cannot follow their own advice, the advice carries no weight.

**Analysis of choices:**
*   **A) Example is more powerful than precept:** This perfectly matches the story. ""Precept"" is the instruction (walking straight); the ""example"" (the mother's movement) is what actually matters. Because she cannot set the example, her instruction fails.
*   **B) Contentment with our lot...:** Not relevant to the mother’s criticism.
*   **C) Those who cannot see the path...:** This is a possibility, but the story focuses more on the hypocrisy of the teacher rather than the danger of the guide.
*   **D) Hypocritical equals...:** While hypocrisy is present, the mother and son are not ""equals"" in a traditional fable hierarchy, and the core lesson is about leadership/parenting by example.
*   **E) Even the crooked can find their way...:** This contradicts the ending, as the son does not find his way; he realizes the instruction was impossible.

**Conclusion:** The fable is a classic illustration that one should ""practice what they preach"" because others follow examples rather than words.

When the fox found out about this she paid a visit to the wolf a,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central characters:

1.  **The Characters:** Both the wolf and the fox are traditional symbols of ""thieves"" or tricksters in fables. The wolf has a ""store of booty"" (stolen goods), and the fox is attempting to manipulate him to get some of it.
2.  **The Conflict:** The wolf is spiteful and suspicious, refusing to share. The fox, motivated by spite and greed, betrays the wolf to the shepherd.
3.  **The Resolution:** The wolf is killed (one thief destroyed). The fox then profits from the wolf's stolen goods (""someone else's larder"").
4.  **The Climax:** The fox is eventually caught and killed by hunters. She realizes in her final moments that her death is a just consequence for causing the death of another.

**Analyzing the Options:**
*   **A) Take pleasure when thieves destroy themselves:** This aligns with the classical interpretation of this Aesopic fable (often titled ""The Wolf and the Fox""). It suggests that when two dishonest or ""predatory"" individuals turn on one another, it is a favorable outcome for the rest of society. Both the wolf (the thief) and the fox (the betrayer/thief) are eliminated by their own vices.
*   **B) Never trust a known deceiver:** While logical, the story focuses more on the circular nature of betrayal and the destruction of the thieves rather than a lesson on trust.
*   **C) Gratitude tempers relentless spite:** The story shows the opposite; there is no gratitude, only spite.
*   **D) Cunning wit has always a spiteful answer ready:** This describes the dialogue, but not the overarching lesson of the fox's death.
*   **E) Isolation in abundance...:** This is factually incorrect regarding the story's themes.

The fable illustrates that the wicked often bring about their own destruction and that it is a positive outcome for the world when such individuals eliminate each other.

But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; ,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Situation:** An Eagle and a Serpent are locked in a life-and-death struggle.
2.  **The First Good Turn:** A countryman intervenes to help the Eagle, saving its life and allowing it to escape the Serpent's coils.
3.  **The Conflict:** The Serpent, seeking revenge against the man, poisons his drinking water.
4.  **The Second Good Turn:** The Eagle, recognizing that the man saved its life, intervenes just as the man is about to drink the poison. By knocking the horn away, the Eagle saves the man's life in return.

The story highlights a cycle of gratitude and reciprocity. Because the man performed a selfless act to help the Eagle, the Eagle returned the favor when the man was in danger. This is a classic illustration of the proverb ""One good turn deserves another,"" meaning that a favor or kindness should be repaid with another.

While the Serpent's actions involve revenge, the primary resolution of the story is the Eagle's intervention to save its benefactor, focusing on the repayment of kindness.

- Choice A represents this reciprocity.
- Choice B (greed) is unrelated to the plot.
- Choice C is a description of the Serpent but not the overarching ""lesson.""
- Choice D (destroying evil) is common in some Aesop fables, but the Eagle doesn't destroy the Serpent; it simply repays the man's kindness.

His Dog availed himself of the occasion to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, My master gives a feast, a",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Invitation:** A guest Dog invites a stranger Dog to a feast that isn't his own. He is inviting someone to enjoy a hospitality that he does not have the authority to provide.
2.  **The Entry:** The stranger Dog enters the house based on this unofficial invitation (symbolically ""by the back stairs"" or an improper entrance).
3.  **The Outcome:** Because he has no right to be there, the Cook (the authority figure) treats him as an intruder and throws him out the window.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story warns against relying on unofficial favors or entering places where you have no legitimate business or standing. If you slip in through an improper channel, you should expect to be removed forcefully.

- **Option A** directly addresses this: ""Those who enter by the back stairs [improperly/unofficially] may expect to be shown out at the window [expelled].""
- Option B refers to enemies, but the Guest Dog and Stranger Dog were friends.
- Option C and E focus on generosity, but the story is a cautionary tale about overstepping and the consequences of intrusion.
- Option D focuses on ""deceitful promises of safety,"" but the danger wasn't ""known"" beforehand, and the issue was more about the illegitimacy of the guest's presence.

This fable is one of Aesop's, and the traditional moral associated with it is that guests who are not truly invited should not expect to be treated with hospitality.

He ordered that the bag of coins be brought to him as he was dying and then asked",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative elements step by step:

1.  **The Character's Actions:** The man is described as ""miserly"" and his wealth is ""ill-gotten"" (acquired dishonestly or unfairly). He has spent his life ""sweating"" over a heap of money, indicating a life of toil focused solely on hoarding.
2.  **The Outcome for the Wealth:** The bag of coins informs him that his heirs will squander the money on vices (""women and drinks""). This suggests that the effort he put into amassing the fortune was ultimately meaningless and did not result in a virtuous legacy.
3.  **The Outcome for the Individual:** The bag also states that the wealth will bring pleasure to ""demons"" who will subject his soul to ""eternal torments."" This links his greed and the nature of his ""ill-gotten"" gains directly to spiritual suffering.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** While the story touches on greed, its focus is specifically on the origin of the wealth (""ill-gotten"") and the specific consequence of ""eternal torments.""
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there is no mention of governance or chiefs.
*   **C:** This captures the two main points of the bag's dialogue: the nature of the wealth (""ill-gotten gains"") and the ultimate destination of the miser (""eternal torment"").
*   **D:** Irrelevant; this describes a lesson about fear of the unknown, which is not present here.
*   **E:** While true that his legacy was squandered, this is a secondary observation compared to the primary warning about the spiritual consequences of his life's choices.

The fable serves as a warning that wealth acquired through greed and dishonest means provides no lasting benefit to the owner and leads to ruin.

The city mouse finished his business in the country and by means of insistent inv,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the contrast between the two lives described:

1.  **The Country Mouse:** Lives a simple life eating ""humble"" food (acorns). While he doesn't have luxury, he is safe and at peace.
2.  **The City Mouse:** Lives a life of abundance and luxury (""overflowing with food""), but this life is fraught with danger and anxiety (hiding from the butler/humans).

The climax of the story occurs when the country mouse chooses to return to his simple life rather than stay with the delicacies. He explicitly states his reasoning: *""Acorns are enough for me... so long as I am secure in my freedom!""* This indicates that peace of mind and safety (even in poverty) are more valuable than riches that come with fear and danger.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) It is better to live in self-sufficient poverty than to be tormented by the worries of wealth.** This directly reflects the mouse's choice to value his ""acorns"" and ""freedom"" over the dangeous luxury of the city.
*   **B) Consider the consequences of your actions.** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific theme of wealth vs. security.
*   **C) Familiarity can ease the unfamiliar.** This is a secondary observation (the city mouse knew the hole, the country mouse didn't), but it is not the ""lesson"" or point of the fable.
*   **D) Save a familiar Thief...** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **E) A persuasive invitation...** This describes the plot's setup but ignores the actual outcome and the Country Mouse's final moral realization.

The beetle then felt contem",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative arc:

1.  **The Premise:** A beetle becomes dissatisfied with his nature and ""lowly"" lifestyle (living in a dung heap) after observing the majesty of an eagle. 
2.  **The Conflict:** Driven by vanity and arrogance, the beetle claims he is equal to the eagle in voice and beauty (""my voice is no less pleasant... her sheen does not outshine my own"") and decides to abandon his community to ""consort with the birds.""
3.  **The Climax:** The beetle attempts to live beyond his natural capabilities. He cannot handle the environment (strong winds) or the physical demands of high-altitude flight.
4.  **The Resolution:** The beetle falls, loses his home, faces starvation, and ultimately regrets his arrogance, wishing only to return to his original humble state.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the beetle's journey. He ""put on airs"" by claiming equality with the eagle, failed to achieve his new status (""failed to get promoted""), and lost his comfortable former life in the process.
*   **B)** There is no revenge in this story.
*   **C)** The story is a cautionary tale against overreaching, not a celebration of diversity.
*   **D)** This is a quote about follow-through in conflict, which does not apply here.
*   **E)** While the beetle has a moment of wonder, the story emphasizes the disaster that follows his attempts to act on it, making the ""spark"" a negative catalyst rather than a positive theme.

1.  **The Conflict**: The protagonist is confronted with a statue of a lion made of gold. He is torn between two traits: his **greed** (desire for the gold) and his **cowardice** (fear of the lion's shape).
2.  **The Dilemma**: Even though the object is inanimate gold (""What kind of accident... could have produced a lion of gold?""), his innate cowardice prevents him from approaching it. He calls it a ""treasure that offers no satisfaction"" because his fear creates a barrier between him and the reward.
3.  **The Resolution**: Instead of overcoming his fear to claim the prize, he decides to distance himself further and have others take the risk for him, effectively proving that he cannot personally master or enjoy the find due to his nature.
4.  **Evaluating the Options**:
    *   **A**: This captures the essence of the story. The gold is ""of little value"" to him personally because his fear stops him from taking it or enjoying it.
    *   **B**: This is a common moral for other fables (like the donkey in the lion's skin) but doesn't fit the internal struggle here.
    *   **C**: Greed isn't ""blinding"" him; rather, his cowardice is making him hyper-aware of a phantom danger.
    *   **D**: This misinterprets the power dynamic and the ""peril"" (which is an inanimate statue).
    *   **E**: While he struggles with a decision, the core of the struggle is specifically the intersection of wealth and fear.

The fable (traditionally attributed to Aesop) illustrates that for a person governed by fear, even a great fortune is useless because they lack the courage to seize or utilize it.

When opinions were exchanged back and forth, the ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the steps and the interaction between the characters:

1.  **The Context:** The animals assemble to address grievances. The hares, who are naturally weak and vulnerable (""prey""), propose a system of universal equality where strength and power don't dictate hierarchy.
2.  **The Argument:** The hares argue that ""fairness"" should replace the natural order of ""superior"" and ""inferior."" This is an idealistic plea for equality.
3.  **The Rebuttal:** The lions do not argue against the *logic* or the *virtue* of the hares' words; instead, they point out a physical reality. They note that the hares lack the ""claws and teeth"" (the power and means) to enforce such a decree or to back up their demands.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates a cynical but pragmatic truth about power dynamics: ideals and arguments for equality are often ineffective unless those proposing them have the power to defend or enforce them. In a world governed by strength, a position without the means to defend it (claws and teeth) remains vulnerable to those who have them.

- **Option A** directly reflects this: The hares had a position, but they were not ""prepared to defend"" it with the necessary strength, making their plea ultimately futile.
- **Option B** is the moral of *The Lion and the Mouse*, which is not applicable here.
- **Option C** and **Option D** are sentiments the hares might wish were true, but the story ends with the lions' dismissal, showing these ideals are secondary to raw power in this context.
- **Option E** is too optimistic; the dialogue did not foster understanding, but rather exposed the power gap.

There was a whole crowd of monkeys there and one of them ,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Characters and Setting**: We have a liar and a truth-teller in a land ruled by a monkey who desires to be treated like an emperor (a delusion of grandeur).
2.  **The Liar’s Success**: The liar recognizes the monkey’s vanity and provides exactly what the monkey wants to hear: flattery and fabrication. This earns him rewards because the monkey is ""fooled by his flattery"" and ""thrives"" on the deceptive validation of his status.
3.  **The Truth-Teller’s Expectation**: The second man assumes that if a lie is rewarded, the truth will be even more highly valued. This is a logical fallacy within a system built on ego and deception.
4.  **The Consequences**: When the truth-teller objectively identifies the monkeys for what they are (monkeys, not royalty), the leader becomes enraged. Instead of honesty being valued, it is punished violently.
5.  **The Lesson**: The story illustrates that in an environment where the ""ruler"" and the crowd depend on deception and vanity to maintain their dignity, the truth is perceived as a threat or an insult. The monkey does not want reality; he wants his fantasy validated. Therefore, the liar thrives, and the truth-teller is attacked.

*   **Option A** accurately summarizes this: Those who rely on deception (the monkeys/the leader) often retaliate against truth-speakers because the truth exposes their actual nature.
*   **Option B** is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **Option C** is partially true but misses the punishment of the truth-teller, which is the climax of the story.
*   **Option D** uses terminology (""mollifies"") that doesn't fit the violent ending.

This slave-woman, bedecked with gold and trailing a delicate purple robe aro",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"Here is a step-by-step analysis of the fable's moral:

1.  **Analyze the characters:** The slave-woman is explicitly described as ""ugly"" and ""wicked."" Despite these traits, the master treats her as if she were precious, giving her luxury items and gold.
2.  **Analyze the conflict:** The slave-woman mistakenly believes that Aphrodite (the goddess of beauty) has blessed her with beauty or charm to win the man's affection. She attributes her success to divine favor.
3.  **Analyze the goddess's response:** Aphrodite appears not to bless the woman, but to distance herself from the situation. She expresses disgust and ""fury"" that the man perceives beauty where there is none.
4.  **Determine the lesson:** The story parodies the idea that love is always a divine blessing. Instead, it suggests that when a man is obsessed with someone ""ugly and wicked,"" it is not because of the gods' grace, but because he is suffering from a delusion or a lack of sense. The goddess's anger emphasizes that such a preference is an affront to the concept of beauty itself.

In the context of Aesop's fables (from which this story originates), this specific fable (Perry Index 143) concludes with the moral that a man who loves what is objectively unattractive or wicked is effectively out of his mind and offensive to the gods.

1.  **The Problem:** The father has a son with a ""vicious adolescent temper"" who is physically harming others (the slaves).
2.  **The Metaphor:** The farmer yokes an experienced, ""old bull"" to a wild, ""young bull"" who has ""lamed many of the other bulls with his kicking and butting.""
3.  **The Solution:** The purpose of the pairing is not for labor, but for **restraint**. The old bull’s presence and stability prevent the young bull from acting on his violent impulses.
4.  **The Application:** Aesop explicitly tells the father to keep the boy beside him to ""restrain his reckless inclinations with your own moderation.""

**Evaluating the options:**

*   **B) Do not mock... old age:** Incorrect; age is portrayed as a strength (wisdom/moderation) here, not a source of mockery.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers reckless aggression:** This is the most accurate reflection of the text. The ""old bull"" (experience/wisdom) is used specifically to ""keep the young bull in check"" and restrain ""reckless inclinations."" 
*   **D) Slow and wise steady wins the race:** This is the moral of *The Tortoise and the Hare*, not this story.
*   **E) Unchecked behavior in youth can lead to greater harm:** While true to the story's warning (""greater cause for complaint""), it describes the *consequence* rather than the *moral lesson* (the solution) provided by Aesop.

The core lesson is that the steadying influence of an older, wiser individual (the father/old bull) is necessary to curb the aggression of the young.

morables_170,"A wealthy Athenian was making a sea voyage with some companions. A terrible storm blew up and the ship capsized. All the other passengers started to swim, but the Athenian kept praying to Athena, maki",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A ship capsizes during a storm. All passengers are in life-threatening danger.
2.  **The Contrast in Behavior:** Most passengers take immediate physical action (swimming) to save themselves. The wealthy Athenian, however, relies solely on divine intervention, praying and making promises to a goddess instead of physically exerting himself.
3.  **The Climax/Lesson:** A fellow passenger provides the ""voice of reason,"" pointing out that while prayer is fine, it must be accompanied by physical effort (""start moving your arms"").
4.  **The Synthesis:** The fable teaches that one cannot rely on outside help (divine or otherwise) without first helping oneself. This is a classic retelling of the proverb ""God helps those who help themselves.""

**Evaluation of Choices:**
*   **A) Self-effort is essential:** This directly aligns with the passenger's advice to ""move your arms"" while praying.
*   **B) A learned man has always a fund of riches in himself:** This is the moral of a different Aesop fable (Simonides).
*   **C) True power lies in practicality:** While related, ""Self-effort"" is a more precise description of the specific lesson regarding personal responsibility in one's own survival.
*   **D) Powerful opposites are utterly divine and incompatible:** This does not fit the context.
*   **E) True character is revealed when the tides turn:** While the Athenian's character (laziness or over-reliance on status/wealth) is revealed, the primary instruction of the fable is about the necessity of action.

The most accurate moral is that divine or external help is no substitute for personal exertion.

1.  **The Conflict:** The Frog and the Mouse are so consumed by their rivalry and their desire for ""sovereignty"" over the marsh that they commit to a fight to the death.
2.  **The Distraction:** Their focus is entirely on each other. They are ""armed"" and fighting ""in earnest,"" making them completely oblivious to their surroundings.
3.  **The Outcome:** Because they are preoccupied with their petty quarrel, they become easy targets. A third party (the Kite) swoops in and takes them both.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) When fools fight others run away with the prize.** This is a common moral for this fable (often phrased as ""When rivals fight, the spectator reaps the benefit""). It accurately describes how the Kite benefits from their struggle.
*   **B) People who do harm to others destroy themselves in the bargain.** While they are destroyed, the focus is more on the distraction of the fight than the harm intended.
*   **C & D)** These focus on the perspective of the Kite or general vigilance, but ignore the central theme of the rivalry.
*   **E) Rivalries can blind us to the greater dangers lurking nearby.** This is the most precise description of the characters' internal state and the cause of their demise. However, in the traditional context of Aesop's Fables, the moral usually emphasizes that a third party benefits from the exhaustion or distraction of the combatants.

In classic literary collections of Aesop's Fables, the story of ""The Frog and the Mouse"" (specifically the version involving the Kite) is almost universally categorized under the moral that **when fools (or rivals) fight, a third party carries off the prize.**

The surviving daughter wondered to see strangers so much concerned at the loss of her sister, and he",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A mother has lost a daughter. She hires professionals (""mourners were provided"") to cry at the funeral.
2.  **The Observation:** The surviving daughter notices a paradox: the strangers (the hirelings) seem more distraught and emotional than the actual family members.
3.  **The Explanation:** The mother explains the difference between genuine grief and performative grief. The family gains nothing by public displays of crying (""never the better for crying""), but the strangers are expressive specifically because they are being compensated (""the strangers have money for it"").
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the transactional nature of hired service versus the quiet reality of personal experience. It emphasizes that outward displays of emotion—especially from strangers—are often motivated by profit rather than genuine feeling.

Evaluating the options:
- **A** directly addresses the mother's explanation: the ""mourners"" are professionals who perform their service because they are paid.
- **B** and **C** are unrelated to the core interaction.
- **D** is overly complex and misinterprets the daughter's curiosity as a lapse in integrity.
- **E** contradicts the text, as the ""sorrow"" is revealed to be fake/purchased, not shared.

In traditional collections of Aesop's fables (where this story originates), this tale is often titled ""The Mother and Her Two Daughters"" or ""The Hired Mourners,"" and its moral centers on the idea that mercenary motives drive the most visible displays of ""grief.""

'And for what cause,' he asked, 'have y",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this story, let’s analyze the interaction between the traveler and the personification of Truth.

1.  **Setting the Scene:** Truth is found alone in the desert, ""terribly dejected."" This implies that Truth no longer feels welcome or at home in human society (the city).
2.  **The Dialogue:** When asked why she is in the wilderness, Truth explains that in the past, lies were rare (""found among only a few""). However, in the present, lies have ""spread throughout all of human society.""
3.  **The Core Message:** Truth identifies her exile as a direct result of the universal prevalence of dishonesty. If truth is forced into the desert because everyone in the city is lying, the lesson is that falsehood has become a universal human condition.

Let’s evaluate the options:
- **A) Falsehood is with all men:** This directly mirrors Truth's statement that lies have spread through ""all of human society.""
- **B, C, D, E:** These options introduce concepts like pride, curiosity, or compassion that are not the primary focus of Truth's explanation for her exile.

The story serves as a commentary on the scarcity of honesty and the pervasive nature of deceit in the world.

As the ox stru",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Situation:** A donkey and an ox are tasked with pulling a single load together.
2.  **The Conflict:** The ox is injured but works hard, while the donkey refuses to help.
3.  **The Consequence (Phase 1):** Because the donkey did not share the burden, the ox was overworked and died.
4.  **The Consequence (Phase 2):** The donkey, who initially tried to avoid work, was then forced to carry the entire original load *plus* the heavy carcass of the ox. 
5.  **The Result:** The donkey collapsed and died from the very burden he refused to help distribute earlier.
6.  **The Lesson:** The birds explicitly state that if the donkey had helped his partner (the neighbor), he would have survived.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses the cause and effect of the story: by failing to help a partner/neighbor, their portion of the weight eventually becomes your own burden, leading to your downfall.
*   **B** is a general observation about endings (""The end crowns the work"") but doesn't capture the specific communal warning of the fable.
*   **C** is incorrect because hard work did not triumph; the ox died and the donkey was punished. 
*   **D** is vague and doesn't capture the moral responsibility.
*   **E** focuses on personal strength, whereas the story focuses on the consequences of selfishness in a shared task.

The story illustrates that selfishness is self-defeating because the burdens of those we refuse to help often end up falling entirely on us.

1.  **The Premise:** The fable states that due to haste during the creation of Man, Jupiter forgot to include ""modesty"" as an inherent trait within the human composition.
2.  **The Solution:** Rather than rebuilding Man, Jupiter decided to release Modesty as an external force/entity amongst the multitude of people.
3.  **The Conflict/Condition:** Modesty initially feels slighted but agrees to exist among humans on one specific condition: she will not stay in the presence of ""carnal love."" 
4.  **The Conclusion:** Modesty explicitly states that ""wherever that [carnal love] comes... I'm gone.""

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **B, C, D, and E:** While haste is mentioned at the beginning (C), it serves only as the framing device for why Modesty is separate. The core of the fable’s ending—the ""conditional agreement""—focuses entirely on the incompatibility of Modesty and carnal love.
*   **A:** This option directly reflects the concluding statement of the fable. The story serves as an allegorical explanation for why these two specific impulses or ""affections"" are viewed as mutually exclusive in many moral frameworks.

The final lesson is that where one exists, the other must depart.

The fox then said to ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this fable (often attributed to Aesop), let’s analyze the actions and dialogue:

1.  **The Action:** A monkey claims to the fox that the dead people in a cemetery were his ancestors' freedmen (servants). 
2.  **The Context:** The subjects of the monkey's claim are dead and buried. They cannot speak or defend their history.
3.  **The Commentary:** The fox points out that the monkey is choosing to lie precisely because the ""witnesses"" are dead and incapable of refuting his claims.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights how boasters and liars often choose situations where their claims cannot be verified or challenged. This is a common tactic used by deceivers to build a false reputation.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A** directly addresses the theme: deceivers take advantage of the fact that others cannot offer a rebuttal.
- **B** refers to a different fable (The Dog and the Shadow or similar).
- **C** is a general truth but doesn't capture the specific irony of using the dead/silent to support a lie.
- **D** suggests punishment or failure for the deceiver, which is not actually depicted in this short exchange.

The Snake was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural i",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A Farmer shows compassion to a suffering creature (the frozen Snake) by warming it in his bosom. This is an act of extreme kindness.
2.  **The Reaction:** Once the Snake is revived, it follows its ""natural instincts"" and bites the Farmer, killing him.
3.  **The Conflict:** The kindness of the Farmer is met with a lethal injury rather than gratitude. The nature of the ""scoundrel"" (the Snake) does not change because of the kindness shown to it.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The Farmer realizes too late that his pity was misplaced because the recipient was inherently dangerous or ungrateful.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.** This aligns perfectly with the story. No matter how much kindness the Farmer showed, it did not change the Snake's nature or make it feel obligated to act kindly in return.
*   **B) The man who treats others well is rewarded by gratitude.** This is the opposite of what happened in the story.
*   **C) Gratitude prevents regret.** The story is about the absence of gratitude leading to a fatal outcome, not the prevention of regret through gratitude.
*   **D) Injuries may be regretfully forgiven, but not ungratefully forgotten.** This doesn't quite fit the logic of the Farmer's realization or the Snake's instinctive action.
*   **E) Even in the coldest times, a touch of compassion can revive what seems lost.** While literally true in the story (the snake was revived), it ignores the central point/warning: that reviving something dangerous is a fatal mistake. A moral reflects the *lesson* of the tragedy, not just a literal plot point.

The traditional moral of Aesop's ""The Farmer and the Viper"" is that kindness shown to evil or ungrateful people is often met with betrayal.

When the blacksmiths were working, the dog would go to sleep, but when they sat down to a meal he would wake up and approach his masters in a f",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the behavior of the dog in the fable:

1.  **The Context:** The dog lives with blacksmiths. Blacksmithing is a loud, labor-intensive profession involving heavy hammers and clanging metal.
2.  **The Behavior:** The dog is completely indifferent to the loud noise of the work (which does not provide him any benefit) and sleeps through it. However, he becomes alert at the quiet sound of eating (which represents potential food/benefit for him).
3.  **The Masters' Observation:** The blacksmiths point out the selective nature of the dog's awareness: he is ""blind"" to the hard work but ""wide awake"" for the rewards.
4.  **Connecting to the Options:**
    *   **A:** Directly addresses this selective awareness. It highlights how people (or animals in fables representing human traits) ignore what doesn't concern them (the work/hammers) but are hyper-attuned to what benefits them (the food/chewing).
    *   **B:** Relates to agency and responsibility, which isn't the focus here.
    *   **C:** While the story contrasts diligence (the blacksmiths) and opportunism (the dog), the specific irony highlighted is about *perception* and *attention*, making A a more precise fit.
    *   **D:** Relates to the ""Wolf and the Lamb"" style fables involving tyranny, not this scenario.
    *   **E:** Focuses on psychological adaptation to noise, which is too literal and misses the social critique of the dog's laziness/opportunism.

**Conclusion:** The fable satirizes those who are ""deaf"" to duty or the hard work of others but have ""sharp ears"" for their own gain. This maps perfectly to Choice A.

He greeted the unicorn and said to him, 'Let us put aside all that we have done in the past, because I am no ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the plot and the dialogue:

1.  **The Interaction:** The lion (the enemy) feigns weakness and sickness to trick the unicorn (the protagonist) into a state of vulnerability.
2.  **The Conflict:** The unicorn, moved by pity and a sense of honor, gives up his only means of defense (his horn) based on a promise. This allows the lion to attack him.
3.  **The Arguments:** 
    *   The lion argues that mercy toward an enemy is a weakness and that one must do whatever it takes to eliminate a threat.
    *   The unicorn argues that a victory won through treachery and deceit is no victory at all, and that honor should prevail.
4.  **The Outcome:** Because the unicorn trusted his enemy and lowered his guard, he was ""laid low"" (defeated/killed).

While the unicorn captures the *ideal* of honorable behavior, the actual *lesson* of the narrative—the warning to the reader—is about the danger of misplaced trust. The story serves as a cautionary tale: the lion was the unicorn's ""chief enemy,"" yet the unicorn allowed a facade of humility to strip him of his defenses.

*   **Option A** directly addresses the narrative arc: despite the lion being humble and supplicating, his nature as an enemy remained unchanged, and trusting him led to the unicorn's downfall.
*   **Option B** is irrelevant (no bragging occurred).
*   **Option C** is a general truth but less specific to the life-or-death nature of the enemy dynamic shown here.
*   **Option D** is a nonsensical play on the Golden Rule.
*   **Option E** represents the unicorn's perspective, but in the context of a fable involving a predator and prey/enemy, the primary warning is usually against the folly of the victim's trust.

The most comprehensive moral for a fable where an enemy uses a ruse to disarm a victim is that you must never trust an enemy, regardless of their apparent state.

But being the ruler of the freshwater wasn't enough for him; he wanted to rule the sea too. With t",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the plot and character motivations step by step:

1.  **Character Profile:** The Pike is already a ruler—the ""Prince of the River."" He possesses size, beauty, and strength. He is essentially at the top of his own ecosystem.
2.  **The Conflict:** His downfall (or near-downfall) is driven by **ambition** and a lack of contentment. He is not satisfied with being the ruler of the freshwater; he wants to conquer a territory (the sea) where he does not belong and where he is outmatched.
3.  **The Resolution:** He is humbled by a creature natively superior in that environment (the Dolphin) and forced to retreat.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Pike learns that seeking more than what is appropriate or natural for him leads to danger. He realizes he was better off staying where he was respected and safe.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Be content with your lot:** This fits perfectly. The Pike’s trouble began because he was not content with being the Prince of the River. Use of the phrase ""wisely stayed within his own territory"" at the end emphasizes contentment.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you...** The story focuses on the Pike's ambition and power, not really on his reputation or public opinion.
*   **C) Strength without humility invites downfall:** While true, the Pike didn't necessarily lack humility in his own realm; he lacked a sense of boundaries.
*   **D) Ambitious counsel without mighty help is useless:** This is a specific moral from other Aesop-style fables, but there was no ""counsel"" (advice) given here; he acted on his own.
*   **E) True leadership...:** The story is less about how he led the other fish and more about his personal greed for territory.

The most traditional and accurate moral for a story about a creature leaving its natural home to pursue unnecessary power elsewhere is to be satisfied with what one already has.

1.  **The Conflict:** Two soldiers are attacked by a robber.
2.  **The Action:** One soldier flees (cowardice), while the other stays and fights the robber off (bravery).
3.  **The Aftermath:** Once the danger is gone, the soldier who fled returns and boasts about how he would have defeated the robber, brandishing his sword and making aggressive threats.
4.  **The Rebuttal:** The brave soldier rebukes him, pointing out that his words are ""useless"" because his actions (running away) proved his lack of courage. He emphasizes that while the coward's words might fool strangers, they cannot fool someone who saw him ""turn tail and run.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Courage in words means nothing if you flee in danger:** This directly addresses the discrepancy between the coward's boastful words after the fact and his failure to act during the crisis. It highlights the main point of the interaction.
*   **B) There is little risk in being poor...:** This is irrelevant to the plot of the story.
*   **C) Bravery outshines cowardice:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific lesson about ""boasting"" or ""empty words"" that characterizes the dialogue.
*   **D) Know your aggressive, unreliable enemies:** The story is about a companion/ally, not an aggressive enemy.
*   **E) Courage in adversity reveals true character:** This is a strong theme, but the fable focuses more specifically on the vanity of boasting after the threat has passed.

The core lesson is that brave words are worthless once a person has already shown cowardice when it mattered. This is most accurately captured by option A.

1.  **The Conflict:** The birds are resentful because the Hoopoe has been given a seat of honor over them.
2.  **The Reasoning for Honor:** The Hoopoe was chosen for its outward appearance—its impressive crown and multicolored feathers.
3.  **The Subversion:** The story reveals that despite its beautiful exterior, the Hoopoe’s actual habits are base and ""filthy"" (rolling in dung).
4.  **The Lesson:** The contrast between the bird's high honor (based on appearance) and its low nature (based on its actual life and habits) highlights that outward beauty can be deceptive. It suggests that a person's true value is not found in their ""plumage"" but in their inherent character and actions.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) True worth should be measured by character and deeds, not by outward appearances:** This directly addresses the contrast between the Hoopoe's feathers and its actual habits.
*   **B) Revenge/Provocation:** There is no mentions of revenge or a ""weak"" character harming a ""great"" one in this specific text.
*   **C) Resentment:** While the birds feel resentment, the story focuses more on *why* that resentment is justified (the discrepancy between the Hoopoe's appearance and its nature).
*   **D) Kindness:** There is no act of kindness depicted.
*   **E) Inclusivity:** The story is about hierarchy and status, not inclusivity.

1.  **The Action:** A hen is behaving with kindness and maternal instinct toward the eggs of a snake, a natural predator. She is nurturing something that is inherently dangerous.
2.  **The Warning:** The swallow points out that by hatching these eggs, the hen is bringing about her own destruction. Once the snakes hatch, their nature will be to kill the hen and others nearby, regardless of the ""kindness"" she showed them while they were in the shell.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that a wicked nature is inherent. No amount of kindness, devotion, or nurturing can change the fundamental nature of a ""wicked"" entity. Trusting or helping such a creature is a foolish act that leads to one's own downfall.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses the danger of trusting the ""wicked"" (the snakes) even when they seem harmless (in egg form).
*   **B** refers to greed (like *The Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs*).
*   **C** is the opposite of the story's warning.
*   **D** refers to envy or competition (like *The Frog and the Ox*).
*   **E** is a literal observation of the hen's behavior, but it is presented as a mistake, not the moral lesson.

The jackdaw, however, could not stand to live in human society, so w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the steps and the message:

1.  **Analyze the Plot:** A jackdaw is captured and kept as a pet. While it is safe and fed by humans, it values its independence above all else.
2.  **Analyze the Conflict:** The bird chooses to flee captivity to return to its natural home. However, it carries the ""baggage"" of its captivity (the string) with it.
3.  **Analyze the Outcome:** Upon returning to its preferred environment (the nest), the string leads to its death. The bird realizes that its restlessness and inability to accept its situation (being a ""slave"") led to a far worse outcome (death).
4.  **Evaluate the Bird's Realization:** The bird blames its own ""stupidity"" and its refusal to tolerate the condition of human society for its ultimate demise. 
5.  **Evaluate the Options:**
    *   **B, C, and D** are irrelevant to the specific themes of this story (pity, generosity, or betrayal by trust).
    *   **E** is a possible theme, but the story focuses more on the consequence of the bird's *reaction* to its situation rather than just the gift itself.
    *   **A** highlights that our internal state and perspective on our ""condition"" or ""place"" (being a pet vs. being in the wild) dictate our fate and happiness. The bird's inability to reconcile its mind to its condition led to its death. In many classic interpretations of Aesop's fables, this specific story (Perry Index 131) is used to illustrate that in seeking to avoid a small discomfort or perceived lack of freedom, one can run into a fatal disaster, suggesting that our own dissatisfaction is often our undoing. Option A aligns with the philosophical lesson that our own mind and our reaction to our circumstances are what truly define our well-being.

Moral A is the classic interpretation: it isn't the external circumstances (the house vs. the nest) that caused the bird's ultimate downfall, but its own internal drive and refusal to accept its lot, which led it into a fatal trap.

morables_639,"Once, a terrible storm blew at sea, and one sailor noticed that the rest of his companions were each praying to different saints. 'Be careful, my friends,' he said, 'what if we all drown before the me",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of sailors is in a life-threatening storm.
2.  **The Action:** Most sailors are praying to various intermediaries (saints) to deliver their messages to a higher power.
3.  **The Conflict/Problem:** One sailor points out a potential delay or inefficiency: the time it takes for a ""messenger"" to deliver the message might be longer than the time they have left to live. 
4.  **The Solution:** He suggests bypassing the intermediaries and going ""directly to the one who can save us without any help."" 
5.  **The Result:** They pray directly to God, and the storm calms quickly.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) The shortest and surest way of doing things is best.** This aligns perfectly with the sailor's logic. He argued against the indirect route (the messengers) in favor of the direct route (the source of power) because it was faster and more certain in a crisis.
*   **B) It is better to be loved than feared.** This is a common theme in political philosophy (like Machiavelli) but has no relevance to the plot of this fable.
*   **C) Mercy tempers power.** While the storm stopping could be seen as mercy, the focus of the story is on the *method* of the prayer and the elimination of intermediaries, not the nature of the power itself.
*   **D) Not all pragmatic advice is diverse or wise.** This contradicts the story; the sailor's advice was both pragmatic and successful.
*   **E) Urgency in communication is vital.** While urgency is a factor, the specific lesson is about the *efficiency of the method* (directness) rather than just the speed of the message itself. ""The shortest and surest way"" is a more comprehensive summary of the logic used.

The fable (attributed to Aesop or found in various folk collections) traditionally carries the moral that dealing directly with the person in charge is more effective than dealing with subordinates or intermediaries.

morables_444,"A snake and a weasel were fighting with one another inside a house. The mice who lived in the house were always being hunted down by either the snake or the weasel, so when they saw the snake and the ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events step by step:

1.  **The Conflict**: Two powerful predators (the snake and the weasel) are fighting. While they are fighting, they are distracted from their usual prey.
2.  **The Miscalculation**: The mice (the weaker bystanders) assume that because their enemies are fighting each other, it is safe for them to come out. They see the conflict as an opportunity or a sign of safety.
3.  **The Resolution**: The moment the predators notice the mice, they put aside their internal conflict to cooperate (or simultaneously act) against the easier targets. The mice, by entering the fray or revealing themselves during a conflict between superiors, become the new victims.
4.  **The Lesson**: When two powerful forces are in conflict, it is a mistake for smaller parties to interfere or assume they are safe. The predators' mutual enmity is temporary and can be redirected toward a common, weaker target at any moment.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** captures this dynamic perfectly: the mice (bystanders) suffer because they miscalculated their safety during a conflict between powerful parties.
*   **B, C, and E** do not fit the specific outcome of the mice being hunted.
*   **D** is a convoluted statement about preparedness that doesn't quite match the specific irony of the mice's mistake.

The fable (attributed to Aesop) is traditionally used to warn that those who get involved in or let their guard down during the quarrels of the powerful often end up as the ultimate losers.

morables_658,"A Goldfinch escaped from his Master's Cage, and the Master tried to get him back, but the bird refused to return. 'Well!' said the Boy, 'you'll regret it, because you'll never be as well cared for any",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the dialogue and the conflict:

1.  **The Situation:** A goldfinch has escaped a cage where it was well-fed and protected (""well cared for"").
2.  **The Master's Argument:** The master points out that the bird is giving up security and comfort. In the master's eyes, the bird is making a mistake because it will struggle to find such high-quality care elsewhere.
3.  **The Bird's Response:** The bird acknowledges that it might face hardship (""That may be true""), but explicitly states that personal agency and independence (""take care of myself"") are more valuable than safety provided by someone else (""under your care"").

**Evaluating the options:**
- **A) There is no wealth greater than liberty:** This directly matches the bird's sentiment. Even though the ""wealth"" of the master's care is great, the bird values its liberty more.
- **B) Treating people differently:** This is irrelevant to the story.
- **C) Defiance/Concern:** The master's concern is noted, but the story's focus is on the bird's choice.
- **D) Independent location:** This is a philosophical commentary on ""wherever you go, there you are,"" which does not fit the bird’s successful escape and change in status.
- **E) Freedom is a treasure worth pursuing, even at great risk:** While this is a plausible lesson, the dialogue specifically focuses on the trade-off between **care/provision** and **self-reliance**, making ""liberty as a form of wealth"" (A) the most precise thematic match for a fable of this type. In traditional literature, the ""Goldfinch and the Boy"" serves as a classic illustration that freedom is more precious than the finest comforts of a cage.

morables_638,"A donkey was complaining that he lacked horns, while a monkey was complaining that she lacked a tail. The mole said to them, 'Silence your complaining, since you can see that I am deprived of eyes.'",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions between the characters:

1.  **The Characters' Complaints:** The donkey and the monkey are fixated on minor physical ""deficiencies"" (the lack of horns and a tail, respectively). These are non-essential features that do not hinder their basic survival or primary senses.
2.  **The Mole's Intervention:** The mole interrupts them to point out a much more significant deprivation: the lack of sight (""I am deprived of eyes""). 
3.  **The Lesson:** By comparing their minor cosmetic complaints to his fundamental disability, the mole highlights that their situation is relatively fortunate. The story suggests that perspective is the cure for discontent. When we look at those who suffer from much greater misfortunes, our own problems seem more manageable.

Looking at the options:
*   **A)** matches this perfectly. It suggests that considering the heavier burdens of others leads to greater patience with our own.
*   **B)** is about cooperation and consequences (related to the fable of the horse and the donkey).
*   **C)** is a general truth but doesn't capture the specific element of comparison presented by the mole.
*   **D)** describes karma or retribution, which is not present here.
*   **E)** focuses on ""gifts,"" whereas the mole focuses on a lack of basic needs/senses.

Therefore, the moral is that we should be grateful for what we have by recognizing that others face far greater hardships.

morables_42,"A Fox invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his entertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out into a broad flat stone dish. The soup fell out of the long bill of the Cra",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Fox's Action:** The Fox plays a trick on the Crane by serving food in a flat dish that the Crane cannot use. The Fox's motivation is amusement at the Crane's struggle.
2.  **The Crane's Reaction:** Instead of simply being angry, the Crane retaliates by inviting the Fox to a meal served in a vessel suited only for a long neck (a flagon).
3.  **The Result:** The Fox experiences the same frustration she caused the Crane. The text explicitly calls this a ""fitting requital"" based on ""the fashion of her own hospitality.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Do unto others what you would have them do unto you:** This is the Golden Rule. The story illustrates what happens when you *ignore* this rule: if you treat others poorly, you should expect to be treated poorly in return.
*   **B) Beware the sort of person who uses tricks:** While the Fox is tricky, the story's climax is about reciprocity, not just a warning about untrustworthy people.
*   **C) Cleverness can outwit vexation:** This is too vague; the story is specifically about social conduct and consequences.
*   **D) A clever alliance with the powerless is futile:** This does not fit the narrative.
*   **E) Consideration for others' needs fosters true hospitality:** While true, the fable focuses more specifically on the ""tit-for-tat"" nature of the exchange (the ""requital"").

The classic moral associated with ""The Fox and the Stork (or Crane)"" is that one should expect to be treated the way they treat others. Option A is the most accurate representation of this principle of reciprocity.

Wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the persons in her father's house, he made some excuse to send her home o",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A man notices his wife is disliked by everyone in his household (people she spends all day with).
2.  **The Test:** He sends her to her father’s house to see if her behavior causes the same reaction elsewhere.
3.  **The Evidence:** Upon her return, she complains that even the ""herdsmen and shepherds"" (people who are out in the fields almost all day and only see her for a fleeting moment at dawn and dusk) looked at her with aversion.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The husband concludes that if people who barely saw her disliked her, then the people who were around her constantly must have found her intolerable. 

**Analysis of the Morals:**
*   **A) Straws show how the wind blows:** This is a proverb meaning that small signs or minor incidents indicate a larger trend or a general feeling. In this story, the ""straws"" are the brief interactions with the shepherds; their dislike is a small but clear sign of her overall unpleasant character and how much more she must be hated by those who know her well.
*   **B), C), D), E):** While some of these mention themes like curiosity or respect, they do not capture the specific logic of the husband’s deduction or the fable's traditional meaning.

Historically, this Aesop's Fable (""The Man and his Wife"") is used to illustrate how small manifestations of character reveal the larger truth.

morables_693,"The coachman, hearing one of the wheels of his coach creak, was surprised; but more especially when he perceived that it was the worst wheel of the whole set, and which he thought had but little prete",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the text step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A coachman's wheel is creaking (making noise/complaining).
2.  **The Observation:** The coachman realizes the wheel making the most noise is the ""worst wheel of the whole set.""
3.  **The Irony:** The wheel that is doing the least work or is in the worst condition is the one making the loudest protest. This implies that those who contribute the least or are the weakest are often the ones who complain the loudest.
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A) Complaining is the privilege of the weak:** This aligns with the observation that the ""worst"" wheel is the one making the noise. In many versions of this Aesop's fable (""The Creaking Wheel""), the moral is that those who are the least useful or most burdened by their own deficiencies are often the loudest complainers.
    *   **B), C), D):** These do not relate to the specific interaction between the quality of the wheel and the noise it makes.
    *   **E) Noise often masks vulnerability:** While related, the fable specifically focuses on the ""pretension"" and the status of the wheel as the ""worst,"" emphasizing that it is those with the least merit who make the most noise.

In classical interpretations of this fable, the loudest wheel is the one that is the weakest and least capable, illustrating that those who do the least work (or perform the worst) often complain the most. Use of the word ""privilege"" in option A historically alludes to the ""right"" or ""habit"" taken by those who contribute the least.

morables_612,"There was a woman of Sybaris who broke a jar. The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, 'I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you'd gone right",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the woman's reaction:

1.  **The Event:** A jar is broken (a practical problem requiring a physical fix).
2.  **The Response of the Jar:** It behaves as if it were a human in a legal dispute, seeking a ""witness"" to prove a point or win a court case.
3.  **The Woman's Commentary:** She mocks the jar’s decision to litigate. She points out that instead of trying to ""win an argument"" or ""prove a case"" in court, the jar should have sought a ""bandage"" (a practical repair) to stop its ""bleeding"" or damage.

**Analysis:**
The fable highlights the absurdity of prioritizing legalism, debate, or ""proving one is right"" when there is a practical problem that needs immediate fixing. The jar is broken; a witness doesn't fix the crack, but a bandage (repair) would. Therefore, the story emphasizes that taking direct, practical action to solve a problem is far more useful than engaging in arguments or litigation.

*   **A) Action is more valuable than arguments:** This fits perfectly. The woman argues that the ""bandage"" (action/repair) is wiser than the ""court-case"" (argument/witness).
*   **B) You can't please everybody:** Not relevant to the text.
*   **C) Practicality triumphs over sarcasm:** The woman *uses* sarcasm to point out the lack of practicality; practicality doesn't triumph over the sarcasm itself.
*   **D) Practical fortune...:** This is an overly complex interpretation not supported by the simple structure of the fable.
*   **E) Small actions reveal hidden strengths:** The story focuses on foolishness, not hidden strengths.

The most accurate moral is that it is wiser to fix a problem than to argue about it.

When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict**: Two powerful groups, Dolphins and Whales (both large, noble sea creatures), are engaged in a serious war.
2.  **The Intervener**: A Sprat (a very small, insignificant fish) offers to mediate the dispute and act as an umpire.
3.  **The Reaction**: The Dolphins reject the offer immediately. Their reasoning is not that they love the war, but that they find the idea of an insignificant creature interfering in their ""high-level"" affairs to be insulting.
4.  **The Lesson**: The core of the story is the pride of the combatants. They value their status and dignity so much that they would literally prefer to die fighting an equal than to be saved or judged by someone they consider inferior. This highlights how pride and vanity can blind people to common sense or peace.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   A) Not quite right; they don't necessarily *love* the fight, they just hate the ""lowly"" mediator.
*   B) Irrelevant to the story's events.
*   C) **This is the correct moral.** The Dolphins' pride makes them reject a peaceful resolution simply because of the source of the help.
*   D) Too broad and doesn't capture the specific interaction with the Sprat.
*   E) While mutual ruin is possible, the story focuses on the rejection of the umpire due to status.

In many editions of Aesop's Fables, this story is specifically summarized with the lesson that ""conceited persons"" or ""proud men"" would rather perish than accept help or mediation from those they deem beneath them.

One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them. When th",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the behavior of the Man and the reaction of the Satyr:

1.  **The Context:** The Man and the Satyr are forming an alliance. In folklore and fables, Satyrs often represent creatures of nature who value consistency and straightforwardness.
2.  **The Actions:** The Man uses the same action (blowing breath) to achieve two contradictory results: first to warm his hands (blow hot), then to cool his food (blow cold). 
3.  **The Satyr's Reaction:** For the Satyr, this inconsistency is suspicious. He perceives it as double-dealing or ""double-tongued"" behavior. If a person can use the same tool (breath/speech) to produce opposite effects depending on convenience, they are viewed as untrustworthy or duplicitous.
4.  **The Idiom:** The phrase ""to blow hot and cold"" has become a standard idiom derived from this Aesop fable, meaning to be inconsistent, to vacillate, or to support two opposing sides at once.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with the Satyr’s refusal to trust a man who acts inconsistently.
*   **B:** There is no ""wishing"" involved in the plot.
*   **C:** While the man is being ""adaptable,"" the fable treats this as a character flaw (dishonesty/instability) rather than a virtue.
*   **D:** This is a much too complex and unrelated philosophical statement about vice and virtue.
*   **E:** The actions here don't hide words; rather, the actions themselves create the distrust.

The moral is that those who are inconsistent or try to represent two opposing sides (double-talkers) cannot be relied upon as friends or allies.

1.  **The Setting:** Socrates builds a very small house.
2.  **The Question:** A neighbor questions why a man of his stature would have such a ""tiny little house,"" implying that the house is too small for a man of his importance or for hosting many people.
3.  **The Response:** Socrates replies, ""if only I could fill it with true friends!"" 
4.  **The Meaning:** Socrates' response implies that even a tiny house is difficult to fill because ""true friends"" are so rare. He is not complaining about the size of the house, but rather emphasizing the scarcity of genuine friendship. If he had enough true friends to fill even that small space, he would consider himself lucky.

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **A) True friends are hard to find:** This directly aligns with Socrates’ witty remark about the difficulty of filling even a small space with genuine friends.
*   **B) No curse weighs more heavily than a guilty conscience:** This is unrelated to the dialogue.
*   **C) Curiosity fuels wisdom:** While the neighbor is curious, the focus of the fable is on Socrates' insight regarding friendship.
*   **D) Do not play the modest, philosophical wise man after the fact:** This is a criticism of the narrator’s introductory tangent, not the moral of the fable itself.
*   **E) True greatness often requires enduring present hardships for future recognition:** This reflects the narrator's opening comments about Socrates' death and fame, but it is not the lesson taught by the focal point of the story (the house and the friends).

The core lesson of the interaction between Socrates and his neighbor is that quality of friendship is rare and more important than the scale of one's possessions.

Admittedly, Prometheus had made the lion very large and handsome, supplying him with sharp fangs in his jaw and arming him w",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the progression of the narrative:

1.  **The Lion's Problem:** Despite being the most powerful animal, the lion is fixated on a single, seemingly irrational fear (roosters) and becomes so depressed by this flaw that he considers suicide.
2.  **The Encounter:** The lion meets the elephant, an animal even larger than himself, and discovers that the elephant is terrified of something even smaller and more insignificant (a gnat).
3.  **The Realization:** The lion realizes that if the mighty elephant has a weakness for something as small as a gnat, his own fear of a rooster is relatively minor. He decides to stop feeling ashamed and stop wishing for death.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **B** is incorrect because the lion isn't bragging; he is lamenting.
*   **C** is a valid observation about the story (even strong beings have weaknesses), but it doesn't capture the specific turning point where the lion's perspective changed.
*   **D** and **E** are unrelated to the text.
*   **A** captures the essence of the ""lesson"": the lion stopped his self-pity only when he saw that another powerful creature suffered from a similar (or worse) predicament. The story teaches that observing the struggles of others can provide perspective on our own troubles.

The moral is that our own problems often seem insurmountable until we realize that others have their own—frequently worse—burdens to bear.

The goddess clearly hates you so much that she has taken",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interaction between the crow and the dog:

1.  **The Context:** In Greek mythology, the crow was traditionally considered a bird of omen. However, the dog points out that Athena has stripped the crow of its credibility (an allusion to myths where Athena punishes the crow for its meddling or talkativeness).
2.  **The Dog's Argument:** The dog views the sacrifice as a waste. Since Athena ""hates"" the crow and has rendered its omens useless, the dog suggests the crow is foolish to offer gifts to an enemy or someone who rejects it.
3.  **The Crow's Reason:** The crow admits that its relationship with Athena is poor. However, the crow explains that the sacrifice is a strategic attempt to appease Athena and ""change her attitude."" 
4.  **The Lesson:** The crow is consciously treating an ""enemy"" or a hostile power with kindness/generosity specifically to gain favor or reconcile. This behavior is a common theme in Aesop's fables—using flattery or offerings to win over those who oppose us.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A:** Directly addresses the crow's strategy of treating a hostile party well to gain a benefit (restored credibility).
*   **B:** Irrelevant; the crow isn't choosing an enemy but managing an existing one.
*   **C:** Too poetic and doesn't capture the transactional/strategic nature of the crow’s action.
*   **D:** This is actually a common moral for a *different* fable and contradicts the crow's behavior (she is attempting something despite lacking current credibility).
*   **E:** The crow is sacrificing to a Goddess, not the dog, and the goal is favor, not friendship.

morables_418,"They say that the hyena has a double nature: for a period of time the hyena is male, and then later on she is female. The story goes that when a male hyena was treating a female badly, she said to him",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"In the fable of the hyena, the central theme revolves around a reversal of roles and the consequences of one's actions when positions of power change.

**Step-by-step interpretation:**
1.  **The Premise:** The fable establishes a cycle where roles swap periodically (from male to female and back again).
2.  **The Conflict:** The male hyena uses his current position of strength or dominance to treat the female badly.
3.  **The Warning:** The female hyena warns the male that their positions are not permanent. She reminds him that the roles will soon be reversed, and he will eventually be subject to the same treatment he is currently dispensing.
4.  **The Lesson:** This serves as a cautionary tale for those in power or in a position to judge/mistreat others. It warns that fortunes change, and those who are currently ""on top"" may soon find themselves at the mercy of those they once mistreated.

Among the provided options, **A** most accurately captures this concept of role reversal and the shifting dynamics of power and judgement. While the fable uses ""male/female"" as the metaphor, ""teacher/judge"" in option A represents the broader social application of one person holding authority over another and then the roles being swapped.

morables_227,"A lion was wandering on the seashore when he saw a dolphin stick his head out of the water. The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation:** The Lion (King of the Land) and the Dolphin (King of the Sea) form an alliance based on their status and mutual respect for their respective realms.
2.  **The Conflict:** The Lion enters a battle on land (against a wild bull) and calls upon the Dolphin for assistance.
3.  **The Limitation:** Despite the Dolphin’s willingness to help, his biological nature prevents him from leaving the water to fight on land.
4.  **The Resolution:** The Lion feels betrayed, but the Dolphin explains that the failure isn't due to a lack of loyalty, but a lack of *capability* based on his nature.
5.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches us that when forming alliances—especially for the purpose of mutual aid—it is not enough to simply find someone powerful or like-minded. You must choose allies whose nature and abilities allow them to actually support you in the specific environment or ""peril"" where you will need them.

**Evaluation of options:**
- **A** directly addresses the practical failure of the alliance: choose allies who can actually help when needed.
- **B** is incorrect because the Dolphin did *not* intend to betray the Lion; he was physically unable to help.
- **C** and **D** focus on ""regal"" or ""wild"" status but miss the central point of the Dolphin's inability to cross environments.
- **E** is a plausible modern interpretation, but **A** is the classical moral associated with this Aesop's fable (*The Lion and the Dolphin*), focusing on the practical utility of an ally in times of danger.

morables_248,"A cicada was singing on top of a tall tree. The fox wanted to eat the cicada, so she came up with a trick. She stood in front of the tree and marvelled at the cicada's beautiful song. The fox then ask",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Conflict**: A fox attempts to deceive a cicada into coming down from a tree to eat it, using flattery as a tool.
2.  **The Counter-move**: The cicada recognizes the trick and tests the fox by dropping a leaf.
3.  **The Result**: The fox pounces on the leaf, revealing her true predatory intentions.
4.  **The Logic/Lesson**: The cicada explains *why* he was prepared and cautious: ""I've been on my guard against foxes ever since I saw the wings of a cicada in the spoor of a fox.""

**Analysis of the Cicada's Lesson:**
The cicada didn't need to be eaten itself to learn that foxes are dangerous. It observed the remains of *another* cicada (the ""misfortune of a neighbor/peer"") in the fox's droppings and used that observation to protect itself.

**Evaluating the Options:**
- **A) A discerning person is made wise by the misfortunes of his neighbours.** This matches perfectly. The cicada saw evidence of another cicada's death and used that knowledge to avoid the same fate.
- **B) God is the ultimate judge.** There is no religious or divine element in this story.
- **C) Clever trickery breeds deception.** While trickery is present, the core lesson is about the *reaction* to potential danger based on observation.
- **D) Cautious fear... bring[s] about the very fate we seek to avoid.** This is the opposite of what happened. The cicada's caution *saved* it from the fate it sought to avoid.
- **E) Cunning plans often reveal true intentions.** While true in the story, it is a secondary observation. The ""moral"" of Aesop's fables usually centers on the wisdom gained by the protagonist to survive.

Option A is the classical moral associated with this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Fox and the Cicada"").

morables_422,"The Goat, going abroad to feed, shut up her young Kid at borne, charging him to bolt the door fast, and open it to nobody, till she herself should return. The Wolf, who lay lurking just by, heard this",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the events step-by-step:

1.  **The Context:** A mother Goat gives her Kid a specific instruction to stay safe: do not open the door to anyone until she returns.
2.  **The Conflict:** A Wolf (a predator) attempts to deceive the Kid by imitating the mother's voice. This is an act of hypocrisy/deception—pretending to be someone he is not to gain trust for a malicious purpose.
3.  **The Resolution:** The Kid is observant. Despite the auditory deception (the voice), the Kid identifies the physical reality (the appearance of the Wolf). The Kid recognizes the ""cheat.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The Wolf tried to hide his true nature behind a false identity, but he was ultimately exposed by a careful observer. 

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) A hypocrite can usually be found out:** This fits perfectly. The Wolf is the hypocrite pretending to be the mother, but his true nature is discovered.
*   **B) Concerns about demise:** This does not fit the narrative of the Kid successfully defending himself.
*   **C) Caring hearts:** The Kid’s success wasn't due to a ""caring heart"" but rather caution and observation.
*   **D) Cowardice:** This fable is about wisdom and caution, not cowardice.
*   **E) Neglecting oversight:** The mother actually provided great oversight/instruction, and the Kid followed it, avoiding peril.

In many classical collections of Aesop's Fables, this story (often titled ""The Wolf and the Kid"") is explicitly used to illustrate that those who pretend to be what they are not will eventually be exposed by their own inconsistencies or by those who are vigilant.

morables_157,"A creeping snake who had been stepped on by many people made his way to the temple of Apollo and went inside. Apollo immediately explained to the snake, 'If you had simply killed the first person who ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative elements:

1.  **The Situation**: A snake is being stepped on repeatedly by many people. This implies the snake is being treated as weak or inconsequential, leading to a cycle of mistreatment.
2.  **The Advice**: Apollo tells the snake that if it had reacted with strength (biting/killing) the **first** time someone harmed it, the reputation of that retaliation would have deterred future offenders.
3.  **The Lesson**: The fable illustrates that establishing a deterrent through swift action against a first offense prevents others from taking advantage of you. In a broader societal or legal sense, this translates to the idea that visible and immediate punishment of a crime serves as a warning to the public.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A**: This matches the lesson of deterrence perfectly. By punishing the first offender, a message is sent to others, making them ""afraid on their account.""
*   **B**: The story is about deterrence and proactive defense, not the delay of punishment for the wicked.
*   **C**: Apollo is actually encouraging an immediate (reactive) action to stop a cycle of abuse, which contradicts this sentiment.
*   **D**: While cleverness is a common theme in fables, the specific advice here is about the utility of force/punishment as a deterrent.
*   **E**: This describes a plot point but not the underlying moral lesson.

The fable (often specialized as ""The Snake and the Step"") is intended to show that those who do not defend themselves against the first injury invite many more.

morables_230,"A lion was standing over a young bull whom he had killed when a robber showed up and demanded a part of the spoils. 'I would agree,' the lion said, 'if you were not already in the habit of taking what",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the interactions between the lion and the two characters he encounters:

1.  **The Robber:** This character approaches the lion with a sense of entitlement and a reputation for taking whatever he wants by force. The lion identifies his lack of character and refuses to share, directly resisting the robber's demand. This demonstrates that aggressive or entitled behavior often meets opposition.
2.  **The Innocent Wayfarer:** This character shows respect and fear of the lion's power. He doesn't demand anything; in fact, he tries to avoid a confrontation. The lion is moved by this ""modesty"" and humility. In response, the lion acts with unexpected kindness, not only sharing the prize but also retiring into the woods to make the man feel safe.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Those who take by force are met with resistance, while those who approach with humility may find unexpected generosity.** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between the robber (force/resistance) and the wayfarer (humility/generosity).
*   **B) When a man has both an interest and an inclination to betray us, there's no trusting him.** While the robber is untrustworthy, the story's main focus is on the lion's reward for humility versus his rejection of entitlement.
*   **C) Kindness can tame ferocity.** While the lion is kind, his character is the source of the kindness, and it is the man's humility that prompts it, rather than the man's kindness ""taming"" the lion.
*   **D) Villainous cunning often outwits its modest self.** This contradicts the story, as the ""villainous"" robber failed.
*   **E) Entitlement often blinds one to their own hypocrisy.** While the robber is entitled, this isn't the central lesson regarding the reward of the modest man.

Choice A captures the dual nature of the fable's lesson.

morables_411,"A man kept a hero shrine in his house and made expensive sacrifices to it. Since he was constantly paying out money and spending great sums on the offerings, the god came to him one night and said: 'L",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** A man is performing excessive, expensive sacrifices to a hero/god in his home. He is essentially spending himself into poverty in the name of religious devotion.
2.  **The God's Response:** The god intercedes not to ask for more, but to warn the man to stop ""squandering"" his wealth. 
3.  **The Reason:** The god points out that if the man continues this foolish behavior and becomes poor as a result, the man will inevitably blame the god for his misfortune (even though it was the man's own choice to spend so recklessly).
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the human tendency to act foolishly or irresponsibly and then project the blame onto divine or external forces when the natural consequences of those actions occur.

Analyzing the options:
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the god's warning: people blame the divine for misfortunes caused by their own lack of moderation or sense.
*   **B)** This focuses on promises, which are not the central theme here.
*   **C)** While extravagance is present, the core of the fable is about the shift of blame.
*   **D)** This suggests the man is seeking profit, but the text emphasizes his ""squandering"" and the eventual blame.
*   **E)** While a possible theme in other fables, this specific story focuses on the consequences and the deflection of responsibility.

The most accurate moral is that people often blame others (or the gods) for the consequences of their own foolishness.

morables_477,"A stag had grown thirsty and went to a spring in order to drink some water. When he saw the reflection of his body in the water, he disparaged the slenderness of his legs but revelled in the shape and",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Conflict:** The stag evaluates his own physical attributes. He feels shame and disappointment regarding his **legs** (calling them slender/weak) and feels pride and admiration for his **horns** (reveling in their size and shape).
2.  **The Crisis:** Hunters chase the stag.
3.  **The Utility of the Parts:** 
    *   The **legs**, which he ""disparaged"" (underrated/undervalued), allow him to outrun the hunters and provide him with the means to escape.
    *   The **horns**, which he ""revelled in"" (overvalued/boasted about), become the instrument of his downfall when they get tangled in the branches.
4.  **The Realization (The Moral Core):** The stag explicitly states at the end that the thing he thought was useless or ugly (the legs) was actually his salvation, while the thing he took pride in (the horns) caused his destruction.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) What is most truly valuable is often underrated:** reflect accurately on the stag's regret. He underrated his legs, which were the truly valuable tools for survival.
*   **B) It is often the case that people are greedy for things...:** While the horns brought destruction, the story isn't about ""greed"" (the stag didn't acquire the horns through greed; they are part of him). 
*   **C) Persistence outshines vanity:** The story isn't about the hunters' persistence; it's about the utility of the stag's anatomy.
*   **D) Vain deceivers...:** There is no deception or social manipulation in this fable.
*   **E) Pride in appearances can blind us to our true strengths:** This is very close, but the fable's traditional focus (derived from Aesop) is specifically on how we often despise the things that are most useful to us and admire the things that harm us. 

Comparing A and E: Option A captures the specific irony of the ""underrated"" legs being the source of salvation, which is the crux of the stag's final lament. Historically, the moral attached to ""The Stag at the Pool"" focuses on how utility is often found in the things we find unattractive or ""disparage."" Option A is the most comprehensive fit for the text's ending: ""The thing that I disparaged could have saved me.""

But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at ",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Conflict:** The story begins with a power imbalance. The Eagle, a powerful predator, ignores the plea of the tiny Beetle and disrespects her by knocking her aside to kill the Hare.
2.  **The Action:** Despite being much smaller and physically weaker, the Beetle is persistent and clever. She seeks revenge by destroying what the Eagle values most (her eggs), even finding her way to the highest mountain crags.
3.  **The Resolution:** Even when the Eagle seeks the protection of the highest god, Jupiter, the Beetle finds a way to cause the eggs to break. Jupiter eventually acknowledges the **justice** of the Beetle's cause, recognizing that the Eagle’s initial arrogance and cruelty justify the Beetle's retaliation.
4.  **The Lesson:** The core of the story is that even the smallest or ""weakest"" creature can find a way to avenge a wrong committed by the powerful. It is a warning against arrogance and mistreating those one perceives as insignificant.

Comparing this to the options:
*   **A** aligns perfectly with the Beetle’s successful campaign for justice against a much stronger opponent.
*   **B** focuses on greed and honor, which are not the primary themes here.
*   **C** and **D** deal with leadership and restraint, but the story is more specifically about retaliation and justice.
*   **E** is incorrect because the Eagle shows no compassion, and the Beetle focuses on revenge rather than bridging a divide.

morables_488,"A merchant who owned a donkey heard that salt was cheaper by the seashore, so he decided to go into the salt business. He went and loaded his donkey with salt and then headed back home. At a certain m",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The First Event:** An accident occurs where the donkey falls, the salt dissolves, and the load becomes lighter. This was a stroke of luck.
2.  **The Second Event:** The donkey attempts to replicate the result by intentionally falling. He successfully tricks the merchant once.
3.  **The Third Event:** The merchant realizes he is being deceived (""The merchant realized what was happening""). He changes the cargo to sponges.
4.  **The Outcome:** The donkey tries the same trick again, but because the merchant is now wise to the donkey's scheme, the trick backfires, and the donkey is punished with a much heavier load.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The donkey successfully fooled the merchant once, but the merchant caught on. When the donkey tried to repeat the trick, it failed because the merchant was prepared.
*   **B:** The story is about cleverness and consequences, not social reputation or self-image.
*   **C:** While the donkey was ""wicked,"" the focus isn't on a general observation of traps, but specifically on the failure of a repeated trick.
*   **D:** This is overly cynical and does not accurately reflect the cause-and-effect relationship of the donkey's specific actions.
*   **E:** This describes the first event (the accident) but misses the point of the merchant's retaliation and the ultimate lesson about deception.

The story illustrates that a trick used once to gain an advantage may be discovered, and those who attempt to repeat such deceptions will eventually be caught and suffer for it.

morables_211,There was a blind man who was in the habit of identifying any animal that was placed in his hands by touching it. Once they gave him a wolf cub. Even after stroking the animal he was not sure of its i,0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Character's Ability:** The protagonist is a blind man who relies on touch and intuition rather than sight to identify animals. This suggests he perceives the ""nature"" of a creature rather than just its outward appearance.
2.  **The Situation:** He is presented with a young cub (a baby wolf). Even though the animal is young and likely lacks the physical size or aggressive history of an adult wolf, the man senses its inherent nature.
3.  **The Conclusion:** The man admits he cannot perfectly classify the species, but he identifies a fundamental truth: the animal possesses a nature that is incompatible with the safety of a flock of sheep.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable emphasizes that an animal's (or person's) inherent character or ""evil"" tendencies are present from birth/youth, regardless of how small or harmless they may seem at the time. This aligns with the classical Aesopic interpretation that nature is fixed from the start.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the idea that the cub's dangerous nature is detectable even in its youth.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there is no discipline or ""harsh means"" in the story.
*   **C:** The story is actually about the *limitations* of physical appearance (as the man is blind) and the clarity of sensing internal nature.
*   **D:** There is no reward or punishment mentioned.
*   **E:** While plausible, it is less specific than the traditional moral regarding early signs of character.

In historical collections of Aesop's Fables, the moral associated with this specific story is that a creature's character is evident from its youth.

morables_694,"There was a generous Rich Man who always had a grand and open table, so he never lacked guests. This man noticed that all sorts of people came to him, and he became curious to see who were true friend",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"The story describes a man who provides food and hospitality to many, but finds that when he tests their loyalty by asking for help in a dangerous situation (a quarrel requiring swords), almost all of them make excuses to avoid helping. Only two out of a large crowd remain loyal.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the lesson:
1. **The Hook:** The Rich Man’s generosity creates a ""grand and open table,"" attracting a large volume of people.
2. **The Conflict:** He suspects that the quality of his company does not match the quantity.
3. **The Test:** He presents a scenario involving risk and sacrifice (a fight).
4. **The Result:** The vast majority (the ""hangers-on"") abandon him when his friendship requires effort or danger, while a tiny minority remains faithful.
5. **The Conclusion:** The core takeaway is that while it is easy to find people to share in your success and bounty, it is very difficult to find genuine friends who will stand by you in times of adversity.

While ""E"" touches on the nature of company vs. sincerity, the traditional moral associated with this fable (often attributed to Aesop or similar folklore collections) focuses on the scarcity of real friendship discovered through trials. Choice **A** most directly captures the central theme that among a multitude of acquaintances, genuine friends are rare.

The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, 'Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch m",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dynamics between the characters:

1.  **The Characters:** There are two pots, one made of fragile earthenware and one made of strong brass.
2.  **The Situation:** They are both being carried by the same river. The current is out of their control.
3.  **The Conflict:** The Earthen Pot realizes that while they are both ""pots"" on the same journey, a collision would be harmless to the Brass Pot but fatal to the Earthen Pot.
4.  **The Lesson:** The Earthen Pot seeks distance because an association between unequals—where one is much stronger or more powerful than the other—poses a constant danger to the weaker party. If the ""high and mighty"" (the Brass Pot) hits the ""humble"" (the Earthen Pot), only the latter suffers.

Historically, this Aesop's fable concludes with the moral that ""Equals make the best friends"" (or ""The strong and the weak cannot keep company""). While the pots are traveling together, their difference in strength makes a close friendship or proximity dangerous for the fragile one.

*   **A** highlights that safety and true companionship are found among those of similar status/strength.
*   **B** focuses on overestimating worth, but the Earthen Pot is actually being very realistic about its fragility.
*   **C** and **E** are modern ""participation"" sentiments that ignore the inherent danger described in the text.
*   **D** is not a standard interpretation or a coherent moral for this specific fable.

The wild boar replied, 'I have",0.0,A,2,medium,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Action:** The wild boar is sharpening his tusks even though no predator is attacking him at that exact moment.
2.  **The Reasoning:** He explains that if he waits until danger arrives, it will be too late to sharpen his weapons. He must have them ready in advance to defend himself effectively.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story emphasizes the importance of preparation and being ready for a crisis before it occurs.

Now, let's look at the options:
*   **A) Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace.** This aligns perfectly with the theme of ""being ready so you don't have to get ready."" In literature and fables (specifically Aesop's, from which this originates), the boar represents the prudent individual who prepares for conflict during times of peace.
*   **B), C), D), and E)** do not accurately reflect the core message of the boar’s proactive preparation. While E mentions nature, the specific lesson is about the *utility* of foresight and preparedness.

1.  **The Deception**: A man intends to steal a deposit and is called to swear an oath. He worries about divine retribution.
2.  **The Misunderstanding**: He meets Oath, who tells him that he usually only returns to a city every thirty or forty years. The man interprets this as a ""safe window"" to commit perjury without immediate consequence.
3.  **The Consequence**: Because the man intentionally used this information to ""provoke"" the god (by swearing a false oath immediately after being told the ""rules""), the god returns the very same day to punish him.
4.  **The Lesson**: The god explains that while there are general patterns to his arrival, those who intentionally test or provoke justice will find that it can arrive at any moment.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) There is no fixed day on which wicked people are punished:** This directly reflects the ending of the story. The man thought there was a ""fixed"" schedule (30-40 years), but Oath reveals that the timing of punishment is unpredictable and can be immediate.
*   **B) More good in one man than a crowd:** Irrelevant to this story.
*   **C) Fear distorts divine truth:** While the man was afraid, it was his greed and overconfidence in a perceived timeline that led to his downfall, not a distortion of truth caused by fear.
*   **D) Inciting strife vs. taking part:** Irrelevant to the plot of perjury and divine justice.
*   **E) Temporary gain/lasting debt on conscience:** While true in a general sense, the story focuses specifically on the **timing of divine punishment** rather than the internal state of the man's conscience.

The fable (recorded in the Aesopica) is specifically intended to warn that divine justice does not follow a predictable schedule and can strike whenever it is provoked.

morables_66,"A Lark had made her nest in the early spring on the young green wheat. The brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their feathers, whe",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the mother Lark's reactions:

1.  **The First Event:** The farmer asks his neighbors for help. The mother Lark is not worried because she knows that relying on others often leads to delay or lack of action. As long as the farmer waits for others, the job won't get done.
2.  **The Second Event:** The farmer decides to take matters into his own hands, hiring workers and coming himself. The mother Lark recognizes that when a person decides to do the work themselves rather than waiting for favors, the task will finally be accomplished.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that you cannot depend on others to do your work for you. True progress happens when you take personal responsibility and action.

*   **Option A (Self-help is the best help)** aligns perfectly with this theme. It suggests that personal initiative is more effective than relying on others.
*   Option B (Cunning) is irrelevant as there is no trickery involved.
*   Option C (Wisdom/Determination) is vaguely related but doesn't capture the core theme of self-reliance.
*   Option D (The Golden Rule) does not apply to the farmer's harvesting habits.
*   Option E (New beginnings) is too poetic and misses the practical lesson of the narrative.

The traditional moral of this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Lark and her Young Ones"") is that one should not rely on others for what they can do themselves.

As soon as he realized what was going on, Aesop -- who w",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the symbolism and the dialogue step by step:

1.  **The Context:** Aesop, a wise man, is engaging in a ""childish"" activity (playing marbles). An observer mocks him, assuming that being playful is a sign of lack of intelligence or ""craziness.""
2.  **The Metaphor:** Aesop uses an unstrung bow as an analogy. A bow under constant extreme tension (tightly strung) loses its elasticity and eventually snaps. It becomes useless.
3.  **The Application:** The ""bow"" represents the human mind or spirit. If a person focuses exclusively on serious, strenuous intellectual labor without ever relaxing or playing, they will burn out or ""break.""
4.  **The Conclusion:** Aesop is explaining that his playfulness is not a sign of madness, but a necessary period of rest that allows his mind to stay sharp and ""ready to use"" for serious work.

Looking at the options:
*   **A)** directly addresses the metaphor of the bow: resting is essential to maintain functionality and clarity.
*   **B)** is irrelevant to the text.
*   **C)** describes the observer's reaction but isn't the ""lesson"" Aesop explains.
*   **D)** describes what Aesop did, but it isn't the universal truth being taught.
*   **E)** is a plausible observation about Aesop himself, but the specific explanation provided by Aesop focuses on the necessity of **recreation/rest** (the unstrung bow) rather than the deceptive nature of appearances.

Therefore, the primary moral is that continuous tension is harmful and intervals of relaxation are necessary for productivity.

'I breed only one,' said the lioness, 'but he is very ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the sow and the lioness:

1.  **The Characters:** The sow is characterized by her large litter (quantity), while the lioness is characterized by a single offspring that is a lion (quality/status).
2.  **The Interaction:** The sow boasts about her numerical superiority, attempting to make the lioness feel inferior for having fewer children.
3.  **The Response:** The lioness acknowledges the small number (""I breed only one"") but highlights the nature of that one (""but he is a lion"" or ""he is very well bred""). 
4.  **The Lesson:** The story contrasts **quantity** (many piglets) with **quality** (one lion). The lioness wins the verbal exchange by pointing out that a single superior being is worth more than a multitude of common ones.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Quality is more valuable than quantity:** This directly maps to the contrast between the many piglets and the single lion.
*   **B), C), D), and E):** These do not capture the core irony of the lioness’s retort regarding the ""value"" of the offspring.

Therefore, the moral of the fable is that excellence or quality outweighs mere numbers.

morables_179,"Running swiftly, balancing on the razor's edge, bald but with a lock of hair on his forehead, he wears no clothes; if you grasp him from the front, you might be able to hold him, but once he has moved",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this fable, let's break down the symbolism described:

1.  **""Running swiftly"" and ""Brief moment"":** The physical description emphasizes that opportunity is transient and moves quickly.
2.  **""A lock of hair on his forehead"" vs. ""Bald"":** This is a classic allegorical representation of *Caerus* (Opportunity). If you meet him face-to-face, you can grab the ""forelock"" (the hair on the front). However, the back of his head is bald, meaning there is nothing to grab onto once he has passed you.
3.  **""Not even Jupiter himself can pull him back"":** This emphasizes that once a window of opportunity has closed, it is gone forever, and no amount of power or regret can reclaim it.

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A) Seize opportunities when they arise.** This aligns perfectly with the imagery of grabbing the forelock before the figure passes.
*   **B) Be content with your lot.** The text is about action and timing, not contentment.
*   **C) Power without purpose is ineffectual.** While Jupiter is mentioned, the focus is on the nature of time and opportunity, not the mismanagement of power.
*   **D) Boast of one powerful thing...** This is a specific moral for different fables (like the Fox and the Cat) and does not apply here.
*   **E) Every daring act teeters on the fine line...** While ""razor's edge"" is mentioned, the core of the fable is about the inability to catch opportunity once it has passed, rather than the psychology of bravery.

The fable serves as a reminder that timing is everything and one must act immediately when a chance presents itself.

He then asked the fox if he might be allowed to take the meat, and the fox ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the actions and outcomes of the characters:

1.  **The Fox's Behavior:** The fox identifies a danger (the trap) and decides not to risk herself. However, when the wolf arrives, she uses false friendship and ""kind"" words (""help yourself,"" ""one of my very dearest friends"") to lure the wolf into the danger she has already identified. This is an act of deception and manipulation.
2.  **The Wolf's Behavior:** The wolf takes the fox's words at face value without questioning her motives or examining the situation himself. He is lured by flattery and a false sense of security.
3.  **The Outcome:** The wolf is injured by the trap the fox knew was there. He realizes that the fox's ""gift"" was actually a betrayal.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **B, C, and E:** These capture side themes (limits, trust, caution), but they do not address the core of the fox's malicious deceit.
*   **D:** This is the famous moral of ""The Fox and the Cat,"" but it doesn't fit here because the wolf didn't fail due to a lack of skills, but rather due to being tricked.
*   **A:** This is the most accurate. The story illustrates that those who use flattery (""dearest friends"") to masks their true, harmful intentions cannot be trusted. The fox's ""kindness"" was a mask for her willingness to let someone else suffer the consequences of the trap.

The story serves as a warning against trusting those who offer uncharacteristic or overly ""friendly"" gifts that seem too good to be true, especially when they themselves are avoiding the situation.

To determine the moral, let's look at the sequence of events:
1. **The Promise:** In a time of potential hardship (winter), one beetle promises to bring back food for the other if they find a good source. This is a commitment made when the future is uncertain but the intention is positive.
2. **The Success:** The beetle finds an abundance of ""moist and fresh"" manure on the mainland, becoming ""plump and fat.""
3. **The Failure to Deliver:** Despite their success, the beetle returns empty-handed.
4. **The Excuse:** The beetle blames the ""nature of the place"" rather than their own failure to uphold the pact. They enjoyed the benefit of the resource but did not fulfill the obligation they created when things were uncertain.

**Evaluating the Options:**
- **A) Beware of empty promises made during good times.** (While the promise was made as winter approached, it was essentially a ""fair-weather"" or ""easy-to-make"" promise that the beetle had no true intention or ability to follow through on once they were personally satisfied.)
- **B) We should not pick fights with people stronger than we are.** (Not applicable; there is no conflict or display of strength.)
- **C) Curiosity can uncover hidden resources.** (Not the focus; the focus is on the broken social bond.)
- **D) There's a curious time for work and an expectant time for play.** (Not applicable.)
- **E) Even the smallest creatures find value in what others discard.** (While true regarding dung beetles, it is a literal observation rather than the moral lesson of the interaction between the two characters.)

The story is a classic Aesop-style fable illustrating that people often make grand promises when they need moral support or are planning a venture, but once they achieve comfort and success, they often find excuses for why they cannot share that success with those they left behind.

When they came to a well, one of them thought that they should jump in immediately, but the other one said, ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the steps and the logic:

1.  **Analyze the context:** Two frogs are looking for a home because their previous one dried up. This establishes the problem: a lack of water and the need for a sustainable environment.
2.  **Analyze the conflict:** They find a well. One frog wants to jump in immediately (acting on impulse to solve the immediate problem of finding water).
3.  **Analyze the cautionary wisdom:** The second frog stops the first, pointing out a future consequence: if this water dries up, the depth of the well will trap them inside. He is considering the long-term risk and the ""exit strategy"" before committing to an action.
4.  **Evaluate the options:**
    *   **A) Look before you leap:** This is a literal and metaphorical fit. The frog is literally being told to ""look"" (consider the consequences) before ""leaping"" into the well.
    *   **B) Watch the actions of your enemy:** There are no enemies in this story.
    *   **C) Haste often leads to regret:** While relevant, it is less specific to the ""exit strategy/consequence"" aspect than option A.
    *   **D) Impulsive, vicious people...:** This describes a different fable (like the Scorpion and the Frog). These frogs are not vicious.
    *   **E) Adaptability is key:** While they are trying to adapt, the story's climax focuses specifically on the caution required before making a decision.

The story is a classic Aesop's fable titled ""The Two Frogs,"" and its traditional moral is ""Look before you leap,"" emphasizing the importance of considering consequences before taking action.

morables_368,"Thanks to his excellent qualities, Hercules was received into heaven. He saluted the gods who came to congratulate him one after another, but when he was approached by Plutus, the god of wealth and th",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this story, let's look at the key elements of the narrative:

1.  **Context**: Hercules is admitted to heaven because of his ""excellent qualities"" (virtue and heroism).
2.  **Conflict**: Hercules greets all the gods except Plutus (Wealth).
3.  **The Reasoning**: Hercules explains his disdain for Plutus by stating that wealth is a ""friend to the wicked"" and ""corrupts the entire world.""

**Step-by-step Analysis:**
*   **A**: This choice suggests that wealth interferes with honest recognition or praise. While Hercules refuses to acknowledge Plutus, the story emphasizes the *moral corruption* of wealth rather than just a ""stop to traffic in praise.""
*   **B**: This speaks to the hidden dangers of a ""soft life,"" which isn't the primary focus here.
*   **C**: This is a potential theme, but the fable focuses more on the negative influence of wealth on society and its affinity for the ""wicked.""
*   **D**: This focuses on thieves, which is too specific for this broader fable.
*   **E**: While Hercules is in heaven due to virtue, the specific dialogue and punchline of the fable focus on his rejection of wealth as a corrupting force.

Comparing these options to the traditional Aesopic interpretations of this specific fable (often titled ""Hercules and Plutus""), the story serves to warn that wealth is frequently associated with bad character and can corrupt excellence. However, among the provided options, **Choice A** is the most classical interpretation of this specific text. In many translations of Phaedrus (who wrote a version of this fable), the moral is expressed as: **""Wealth is the enemy of honest men because it rewards the wicked.""** Choice A captures the idea that wealth (""coffers of cash"") prevents or discourages the honest evaluation and ""traffic"" of true merit/praise.

However, many educational contexts use this fable to illustrate that virtue is the only thing that earns a place in heaven, and wealth is to be looked down upon. Between the nuances: A focuses on the corruption of praise/recognition, while the fable highlights that Hercules (the virtuous) hates wealth because it aids the wicked. Choice A is the most standard literary ""moral"" attached to this specific Phaedrus fable.

The dog summoned the wolf as his witness",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s break down the narrative elements:

1.  **The Conflict:** A dog makes a false accusation against a sheep to steal resources (bread).
2.  **The Deception:** A wolf provides false testimony to assist the dog's lie, escalating the injustice.
3.  **The Result:** The sheep is unjustly punished due to the lies of the ""witness.""
4.  **The Resolution:** Shortly after, the wolf (the liar) is found dead in a ditch.
5.  **The Conclusion:** The sheep interprets the wolf's death as divine retribution (""the reward that gods give to liars"").

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) Wicked liars generally get their just consequences.** This aligns perfectly with the sheep's final statement and the wolf's fate. It emphasizes that those who deceive will eventually face punishment.
*   **B) Harsh means vs. kind means.** The story is about perjury and justice, not about different methods of teaching or reasoning.
*   **C) Deception often masks innocence.** While the sheep's innocence was masked by the lie, the story focuses more on the ultimate fate of the liar.
*   **D) Putting up with insults invites more.** The sheep did not ""put up"" with it; she was legally sentenced. 
*   **E) Fabric of trust.** While true in a general sense, the specific ending focuses on the *punishment* of the liar rather than the social decay of trust.

The story serves as a warning that although liars may win in the short term, they will eventually face a grim fate or ""poetic justice.""

'What have I done that I must die?' said she; 'I have stolen neither gold nor silver, but only a grain of corn to satisfy my ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A Lark (the victim) is caught in a snare by a Fowler (the adversary). The Lark is in a position of complete powerlessness.
2.  **The Argument:** The Lark attempts to plead her case based on logic and justice. She argues that her ""crime"" (stealing a single grain of corn) is trivial and does not warrant a death sentence, especially compared to stealing gold or silver.
3.  **The Response:** The Fowler does not engage with the argument. He is both the captor (adversary) and the person with the power to decide her fate (judge). Because his goal is simply to catch birds, the ""justice"" or ""proportionality"" of the Lark's plea is irrelevant to him.
4.  **The Outcome:** The Fowler kills the Lark regardless of her innocence or the logic of her plea.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The Fowler has already decided the outcome. Since he acts as both the one who caught her and the one who judges her, the Lark's verbal defense is futile.
*   **B:** While the Lark risked her life for a grain of corn, the focus of the story is on the futility of her plea once caught, rather than a warning against greed.
*   **C:** The story shows the opposite; there is no mercy, only a silent and brutal end.
*   **D:** This is convoluted and doesn't align with the direct narrative of the fable.
*   **E:** The story proves sincerity was *not* powerful; it was ignored.

The most accurate moral is that logic and appeals to justice are useless when the person you are pleading with is the one who benefits from your destruction.

Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events:

1.  **The Situation:** An old nurse threatens a child to be quiet, promising to throw the child to the wolf.
2.  **The Wolf's Assumption:** The wolf overhears the threat and takes it literally. He treats the nurse's words as a promise or a factual statement of intent (""Enemies' promises"").
3.  **The Reality:** When the child cries, the nurse does not fulfill her word. Instead, she protects the child and calls the dogs to chase the wolf away.
4.  **The Lesson:** The wolf learned the hard way that one should not trust the words spoken by an enemy (the nurse, from the wolf's perspective) or words spoken in specific contexts (like a hollow threat to a child).

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Enemies' promises were made to be broken:** This is the traditional moral associated with this Aesop's fable (""The Nurse and the Wolf""). It highlights that the wolf was foolish to rely on the ""promise"" of someone who is naturally his adversary.
*   **B) Only untrustworthy people blame...:** Not relevant to the plot.
*   **C) Cunning plans often silence...:** The nurse's ""plan"" wasn't particularly cunning, and the wolf wasn't silenced; he was attacked.
*   **D) Expect no reward for serving the cunning...:** The wolf wasn't serving anyone; he was hunting.
*   **E) Harsh words may hide...:** While true to the nurse's character, this is not the standard moral of the fable, which focuses on the wolf's misplaced expectation.

The core lesson is that the wolf was a fool to believe the nurse’s words. In the context of fables, someone you consider an enemy (or who considers you one) will not keep their word to your benefit.

Then the fly laughed at the man and said, 'You wanted to avenge the sting of a ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the actions:

1.  **The Conflict:** A bald man attempts to kill a fly but instead slaps his own head.
2.  **The Fly's Mockery:** The fly mocks the man for his disproportionate response and points out that he has now harmed himself.
3.  **The Man's Defense:** The man distinguishes between the harm he caused himself and the harm cause by the fly. He argues that his own action was an accident (**lack of intent**), whereas the fly's action was malicious. He concludes that he is willing to endure personal inconvenience to eliminate a true nuisance.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A) Intent matters more than the outcome:** This aligns with the man's justification (""I can easily forgive myself since I know that I did not try to hurt myself on purpose""). He distinguishes between the slap (unintentional) and the sting (intentional).
*   **B) Sharing/Rudeness:** This is irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C) Forgiveness outshines mockery:** While he forgives himself, the core of the story is the debate over the ""slap"" versus the ""sting,"" focusing on why one is forgivable and the other is not.
*   **D) Frustrated self-effort:** This is overly wordy and doesn't capture the essence of the ""intent"" vs ""malice"" argument.
*   **E) In anger, we may cause ourselves more harm:** This is a common interpretation of similar fables, but the dialogue in *this specific version* (Phaedrus/Aesop) focuses heavily on the man's rebuttal regarding **intent**. The man explicitly rejects the idea that his mistake is comparable to the fly's malice because he did not *intend* to hurt himself.

In the classic interpretation of this fable (Phaedrus 5.3), the lesson is that while we should be careful not to hurt ourselves in a rage, the distinction between an accidental self-injury and an intentional injury from an enemy is vital. The man's reply emphasizes that he forgives his own lack of intent.

The Hunter agreed, but said: 'If you desire to conquer the Stag, you mus",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Horse wants revenge on the Stag but cannot achieve it alone.
2.  **The Transaction:** The Horse seeks help from a Hunter. To get this help, the Horse agrees to sacrifice its physical autonomy (accepting the bit, bridle, and saddle).
3.  **The Result:** The immediate goal is achieved (the Stag is defeated), but the cost is permanence. The Horse asks for its freedom back, but the Hunter refuses, realizing he now has total control over the Horse.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story warns that in the pursuit of a temporary victory or revenge, one might surrender their liberty to a third party. Once that power is handed over, it is rarely returned.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A** is accurate but framed slightly differently than the core theme of power dynamics.
*   **B** aligns most closely with classic interpretations of Aesop’s fables (specifically this one, often indexed as Perry Index 269). It highlights that the ""injury"" from the Stag was preferable to the total loss of liberty resulting from putting oneself in the Hunter's power.
*   **C** is incorrect; the Horse was not ""cunning,"" but short-sighted.
*   **D** focus on the ""pleasure"" of revenge, which is a secondary theme.
*   **E** is a strong contender, but ""guidance"" is a mild word for the total subjugation (saddle and bridle) described.

In traditional literature, the moral of ""The Horse, the Hunter, and the Stag"" is that the price of revenge is often too high, specifically when it involves surrendering your freedom to someone else. Option B captures the trade-off: it is better to endure a slight or injury than to lose your freedom by seeking a dangerous ally.

morables_239,"The cat saw a stork carrying an eel. Now, the cat is a creature who dearly loves fish although he doesn't like to get his feet wet. So the cat said to the stork, 'O most beautiful bird! You have such ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The Motivation:** The cat wants the eel that the stork is carrying. Because he doesn't want to get wet or work for it, he resorts to manipulation to get the stork to open her mouth and drop the food.
2.  **The Strategy:** First, the cat tries **flattery** (""O most beautiful bird!"") and asks a question designed to make the stork open her beak.
3.  **The Resistance:** The stork recognizes the trap and keeps her mouth shut to protect her prize (the eel).
4.  **The Shift in Tactics:** When flattery fails, the cat turns to **insults** (""wretched creature,"" ""most filthy bird"") to provoke a defensive response.
5.  **The Outcome:** The stork ignores both the praise and the insults, remaining silent and focused on her goal (keeping her meal), and walks away successfully.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Stay focused on your goals:** This is the most accurate description of the stork's behavior. She resisted both positive and negative verbal manipulation to ensure she kept her food.
*   **B) Do not fear death:** Irrelevant to this story.
*   **C & E) Flattery/Beauty masks intentions:** While the cat used flattery, he also used insults. Furthermore, the story is told from the perspective of the stork's success in ignoring the cat, emphasizing the importance of staying the course despite outside pressure.
*   **D) Don't be seduced by cunning words:** Similar to A, but the story also includes insults, making ""staying focused/determined"" a broader and more accurate moral for the stork's triumph over the cat's various tactics.

The stork's silence in the face of both praise and ridicule demonstrates the importance of not being distracted or manipulated away from one's objective.

morables_306,"A dog was sleeping in front of the barn when a wolf noticed him lying there. The wolf was ready to devour the dog, but the dog begged the wolf to let him go for the time being. 'At the moment I am thi",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Opportunity:** The wolf had a sure meal (the sleeping dog) but chose to let it go based on a promise of a better meal later.
2.  **The Deception:** The dog used a clever excuse (a future wedding feast) to escape immediate danger.
3.  **The Outcome:** When the wolf returned, the dog was in a safe position (the roof) and mocked the wolf for believing the promise.
4.  **The Lesson:** The wolf lost his initial prize because he was greedy for more and believed a promise made under duress. The core of the story is that one should seize a certain opportunity when it arises rather than waiting for an uncertain, better one in the future.

Let’s evaluate the options:
*   **A) Take what you can get when you can get it:** This directly addresses the wolf's mistake. He had the dog and let him go.
*   **B) Liberty:** While the dog gained his freedom, the story's mechanics focus on the wolf's missed opportunity and the dog's trickery.
*   **C) The cunning prey on the gullible:** This is partially true, but Aesop's fables involving this specific plot (like the ""Wolf and the Dog"" or ""The Fisher and the Little Fish"") are specifically about not letting go of a present advantage.
*   **D) Cunning enemies' persuasive promises:** This describes the dog, but the proverb usually focuses on the hunter/predator's folly.
*   **E) Delaying the inevitable:** The dog actually escaped permanently, so it wasn't inevitable.

Choice **A** is the classic moral associated with this fable (often categorized under ""The Dog and the Wolf"" or similar to ""The Fisherman and the Little Fish""). It emphasizes that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

morables_222,"A gnat happened to land on the back of a camel and lingered there on top of the baggage. When he finally decided to disembark, he said, 'I will let myself down now as fast as I can so as not to burden",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the character interactions and the central conflict:

1.  **The Gnat's Perspective:** The gnat believes his presence is a significant burden to the camel. He perceives himself as heavy and his departure as a great relief to the beast of burden. This demonstrates a high sense of self-importance or vanity.
2.  **The Camel's Perspective:** The camel, being much larger and carrying actual heavy baggage, did not even notice the gnat's arrival or departure. To the camel, the gnat is inconsequential.
3.  **The Theme:** The story highlights the gap between how an individual perceives their own importance (self-consequence) and how others actually perceive them.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the eyes of their neighbors:** This directly matches the lesson. The gnat thinks he is of consequence (a burden), but the ""neighbor"" (the camel) does not see him that way at all.
*   **B) Arrogant fools have no true influence:** While true, the story is more specifically about self-perception versus reality, rather than just ""influence."" 
*   **C) Patience sees beyond the insignificant:** This focuses too much on the camel's patience rather than the gnat's vanity.
*   **D) A patient, discerning person is made wise...:** This introduces concepts (misfortunes) not present in the text.
*   **E) Even the smallest presence can go unnoticed...:** This is a literal observation of the story, but the ""moral"" usually addresses the human character trait (vanity/self-importance).

Option A is the classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable (and similar ones like ""The Gnat and the Bull""), focusing on the absurdity of overestimating one's own impact.

morables_630,"A fox was walking by a certain farm and saw a crowd of women who, in total silence, were eating many sumptuously roasted chickens. The fox turned to the women and said, 'What shouts there would be aga",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the encounter between the fox and the women:

1.  **The Observation:** The fox sees humans eating roast chicken. He notes that if he were to do the same, he would be hunted, shouted at, and chased by dogs. He perceives a double standard or an injustice in the situation.
2.  **The Rebuttal:** The old woman points out the fundamental difference between their actions: the women are eating chickens that they own (""things which are ours""), whereas the fox's ""pleasure"" (eating chickens) involves theft (""things that belong to others"").
3.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that just because an action is acceptable for someone who has the right or ownership to perform it, it doesn't mean it is acceptable for someone else to do it by infringing on others' rights. Ownership and permission are the keys to the morality of the action.

Now, let's look at the options:
- **A)** Addresses the concept of ownership and the boundary between what is permitted to a person regarding their own property versus what others are allowed to do.
- **B)** There is no mention of friendship or betrayal in the story.
- **C)** While the women are silent, ""outsmarting"" is not the primary focus; the focus is on the right of ownership.
- **D)** Mention of ""malice"" and ""winks"" does not fit the dialogue provided.
- **E)** This describes a detail of the scene but doesn't convey the moral lesson regarding the fox's complaint.

The moral is that the fox cannot justify theft by comparing it to a legitimate owner's use of their own property.

morables_245,"A viper entered a blacksmith's workshop and bit the file, testing it to see if this was something she could eat. The file protested fiercely, 'You fool! Why are you trying to wound me with your teeth,",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of this fable (often attributed to Aesop), let’s analyze the interaction between the viper and the file:

1.  **The Action:** A viper tries to bite a metal file, hoping to consume it or wound it.
2.  **The Conflict:** The file is made of hardened iron, specifically designed to grind down other metals. It is ""insensible"" (unfeeling and hard) and far more durable than the viper’s teeth.
3.  **The Result:** The file points out the absurdity of the viper’s attack. No matter how hard the viper bites, it will only hurt its own teeth, while the file remains unaffected.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) It is useless attacking the insensible:** This aligns with the core of the story. The file is a hard, inanimate object that cannot be harmed by a biological bite. Attacking something that is fundamentally impervious to your weapons is a waste of effort and self-destructive.
*   **B) Lending a hand:** This is irrelevant; there is no request for help.
*   **C) Curiosity without wisdom:** While the viper is curious, the primary lesson is about the futility of attacking a stronger/harder opponent.
*   **D) Foolish injuries:** The story focuses on the futility of the action rather than the nature of forgiveness.
*   **E) Boasting of strength:** The file isn't boasting to invite a challenge; it is responding to an attack that has already occurred.

Traditional interpretations of this fable emphasize that it is foolish to try to hurt those who are much stronger or more resilient than yourself, or to attack ""the insensible"" (those who cannot be felt or moved by your aggression).

As they were disputing, they passed a statue carv",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interaction between the Man and the Lion:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Man and the Lion are arguing about who is superior.
2.  **The Evidence:** The Man points to a statue as ""proof"" of human superiority. This statue represents a human perspective because it was created by a human artist.
3.  **The Counter-argument:** The Lion points out the inherent bias in the evidence. He notes that the statue only shows the Man winning because a Man made it. If Lions were the ones creating the art (telling the story), the outcome depicted would be the opposite.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches us that evidence or history is often biased toward the person presenting it. A single perspective or ""story"" does not represent the absolute truth, especially when told by a party with an interest in looking superior.

**Evaluation of choices:**
*   **A) One story is good, till another is told.** This directly addresses the theme that there are multiple sides to every story and that the prevailing narrative depends on who is telling it.
*   **B) The hero is brave in deeds as well as words.** This is not the focus, as the Lion is questioning the validity of the ""deed"" depicted in the statue.
*   **C) Pride often precedes a fall.** Neither character ""falls"" in this story.
*   **D) Boastful outside show is a poor substitute for proud inner worth.** While they are boasting, the core of the Lion's retort is about the bias of the storyteller.
*   **E) Pride often blinds us to the value of cooperation.** The story is about competition and perspective, not a failed attempt at cooperation.

The most accurate moral, consistent with traditional interpretations of this Aesop's fable, is that the perspective changes depending on the narrator.

morables_267,"The peacock was a remarkable bird both because of the beauty of his feathers with their various colours and also because he was gentle and courteous. On his way to the assembly of the birds, the peaco",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Motivation:** The peacock is described as beautiful, gentle, and courteous. He is approached by birds like the raven who offer to ""squawk his praises"" (flattery) in exchange for his feathers.
2.  **The Action:** Driven by the desire for praise (vanity) and perhaps an over-extension of his ""courteous"" nature, the peacock gives away his feathers to everyone who asks.
3.  **The Consequence:** By prioritizing the external validation and the status of his beauty being praised by others, he loses the very thing that protects him. He becomes ""plucked completely bare.""
4.  **The Outcome:** Without his feathers, he cannot protect his chicks or survive the winter. His vanity and the need for public praise led him to sacrifice his means of survival and his responsibilities.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) Vanity can lead to self-destruction:** This fits perfectly. The peacock traded his life-sustaining feathers for empty praise, leading directly to his death.
*   **B) Do not boast...:** The peacock didn't boast; he listened to others' boasts of him.
*   **C) Opportunism can overshadow courtesy:** While the other birds were opportunists, the story focuses on the peacock's downfall due to his own choices. 
*   **D) Sorrow not...:** The story ends in death and abandonment; it is a cautionary tale, not an encouraging one about resilience.
*   **E) True beauty shines through kindness:** The story contradicts this, as his ""kindness"" (giving feathers) led to his demise and inability to care for his young.

The central lesson is that the peacock's desire for the ""praises"" of others caused him to give away his essential assets until he was destroyed.

You can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth as a w",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot progression:

1.  **The Conflict:** A tiny Gnat challenges a mighty Lion, claiming to be stronger.
2.  **The Victory:** Through agility and strategy (stinging the Lion's sensitive areas), the Gnat defeats the Lion. The Lion ends up harming himself in frustration.
3.  **The Turning Point:** Flushed with pride and ""buzzing about in a song of triumph,"" the Gnat stops paying attention to his surroundings.
4.  **The Downfall:** The Gnat is caught in a cobweb and eaten by a lowly spider.
5.  **The Reflection:** The Gnat laments that after defeating the ""hugest beasts,"" he is killed by one of the most ""inconsiderable"" creatures.

**Analyzing the Options:**
*   **A) No matter how you brag, you can be undone:** This captures the essence of the story. The Gnat’s pride and boasting immediately preceded his careless downfall.
*   **B) Do not ever trust your enemy:** This applies to other fables (like the Wolf and the Crane), but here the Gnat didn't trust the Lion; he simply overlooked a different danger.
*   **C) Pride can turn triumph into frustration:** While true, ""frustration"" is too mild a word for death.
*   **D) Boastful cunning often outwits its frustrated self:** This is confusingly worded and implies the Gnat outwitted himself, rather than being caught by an external threat.
*   **E) True strength is not always visible:** This relates to the first half of the story (Gnat vs. Lion) but ignores the second half (Gnat vs. Spider), which is crucial for the moral.

The story serves as a warning that great success can lead to a prideful lack of caution, proving that even a ""conqueror"" can be brought down by a trivial threat. Option A best summarizes the reversal of fortune caused by the Gnat's boastful nature.

morables_361,"Some fishermen had gone out fishing, and when they had struggled for a long time but had not managed to catch anything, they became very downcast and prepared to turn back. All of a sudden a tuna fish",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **Preparation and Effort:** The fishermen are working hard (""struggled for a long time""), representing **skill** and **labor**.
2.  **Failure of Effort:** Despite their skill and hard work, they catch nothing and are ready to give up. This demonstrates that skill and effort do not always guarantee success.
3.  **The Turning Point:** A tuna fish jumps into the boat of its own accord—not because of the fishermen's technique, but because it was fleeing a predator. 
4.  **The Outcome:** The fishermen succeed (they catch a fish) solely through a random, fortunate event.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** This matches the narrative perfectly. The fishermen's skill failed to obtain the fish, but ""luck"" (the tuna jumping in) provided exactly what they were looking for.
*   **B:** While the tuna was in danger because it was targeted, the story's focus is on the fishermen's transition from failure to success via chance, not the disadvantages of being large or famous.
*   **C:** This describes the fishermen's feeling (going from downcast to rejoicing), but a moral usually explains *why* or *how* the change happened.
*   **D:** This is nonsensical in the context of the story.
*   **E:** This is actually contradicted by the story, as the fishermen were about to give up (stop persevering) when the luck occurred.

In the classic collections of Aesop's Fables, this story is traditionally used to illustrate that fortune can provide what effort cannot.

Not withstanding all his prayers, instead of becoming richer, he got poorer. Out ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the steps and the message:

1.  **The Situation**: A man prays to a wooden idol for wealth, but his situation worsens.
2.  **The Action**: In a fit of anger/impatience, he destroys the idol (an act of ""force"" rather than ""devotion"").
3.  **The Outcome**: The destruction reveals hidden gold inside the idol.
4.  **The Conclusion**: The man changes his perspective on the idol immediately. He no longer views it as a ""deity"" to be worshiped, but as a ""graceless"" object that only yielded results through force.

**Analysis of Options**:
- **A) People adjust their beliefs based on what is profitable for them**: This fits the man's behavior. He worshiped the idol when he thought it would bring him wealth; he cursed and broke it when it didn't; and finally, he redefined the ""deity"" as ""graceless"" once he got what he wanted through destruction. His relationship with the ""divine"" was entirely dependent on his personal profit.
- **B, C, D, E**: These options capture fragments or misinterpret the narrative. While he was impatient (C), the outcome was ""graceful"" (wealthy) rather than graceless. He wasn't ""challenging fate"" (E) so much as reacting in an outburst.

Historically, this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Man and the Wooden God"") is traditionally used to illustrate that some people do not respect or reward kindness/devotion, but only respond to force, or that men's ""piety"" is often tied to their material success. When the man gets his money, his ""belief"" system shifts to justify his violent action over his previous prayerful one.

Then the little gnat said to the bull, 'It's enough for me that you have accepted my ch",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Interaction:** A tiny gnat challenges a mighty bull. By simply accepting the challenge, the bull validates the gnat as a peer.
2.  **The Gnat’s Perspective:** The gnat claims victory not through physical strength, but through the fact that the bull acknowledged him as an ""equal"" by agreeing to the contest.
3.  **The Bull’s Error:** The story explicitly states that the bull should have ignored the gnat. Because he engaged, he gave the ""impertinent creature"" a reason to boast. 
4.  **The Lesson:** The core message is that someone of high status or great ability (the bull) loses dignity and reputation by entertaining a contest with an insignificant or unworthy opponent (the gnat). If you engage with those ""beneath contempt,"" you lower yourself to their level.

Comparing this to the choices:
*   **A** directly reflects the text's conclusion regarding the bull's loss of status for acknowledging an unworthy opponent.
*   **B** is irrelevant to the story.
*   **C** is a general proverb, but the story focuses more on status and reputation than a ""downfall.""
*   **D** is a nonsensical interpretation of the text.
*   **E** touches on the contest, but ""lowering one's reputation"" is the more precise moral regarding the bull's mistake.

The moral is that responding to an unworthy or insignificant provoker only serves to elevate the provoker and diminish the greatness of the one who responds.

The owner began to question the dog, asking how he could be so ungra",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue between the owner and the dog:

1.  **The Context:** The dog ran away despite the owner's claim that he never personally struck or spoke harshly to the animal.
2.  **The Owner’s Defense:** The owner uses a technicality—that his own ""hands or words"" were never the source of the abuse—to claim he was a ""kind"" master.
3.  **The Dog’s Rebuttal:** The dog points out that the owner ordered others to beat him. From the dog's perspective, the source of the order is the true perpetrator of the harm.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story explores the concept of vicarious liability or agency. It suggests that a person cannot escape moral or practical responsibility for actions they delegate to others. If you command a harm to be done, you are the one doing the harm.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** directly addresses the dog's point: what one does through another is their own action.
*   **B** focuses on ""wicked words,"" but the story is about actions and delegation.
*   **C** suggests the dog is ungrateful, which contradicts the dog's valid reason for leaving.
*   **D** discusses ""deceitful promises of safety,"" which is more specific to other fables (like the wolf and the crane).
*   **E** is a literal observation of the plot (the tail leading to the reunion) but not a moral lesson.

1.  **The Situation**: A predator (the butcher) enters a group. Instead of acting collectively to stop the threat, the sheep ignore it because it doesn’t immediately affect them personally.
2.  **The Rationalization**: They tell themselves, ""He keeps his hands off me... let him take whom he takes."" This represents a failure of solidarity and a refusal to recognize that a threat to one is eventually a threat to all.
3.  **The Consequence**: Because they allowed the butcher to pick them off one by one, the flock was decimated until only one remained.
4.  **The Regret**: The final sheep realizes that their downfall was their passivity. Had they stood together and fought back when they were many, they could have defeated the butcher.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A** directly mirrors the theme of the story: failing to protect or speak up for others leading to one's own isolated demise. This is a classic theme famously echoed in the ""First they came..."" poem by Martin Niemöller.
*   **B** refers to ""changing evils,"" which isn't the focus here.
*   **C** is a general platitude that doesn't capture the specific social/collective failure of the sheep.
*   **D** relates to rhetoric and enemies, which doesn't fit the plot.
*   **E** mentions ""fitting in with the mighty,"" but the sheep weren't trying to fit in with the butcher; they were trying to ignore him.

1.  **The Action:** A hooligan commits a reckless, aggressive act (striking Aesop with a stone).
2.  **The Immediate Reaction:** Instead of punishing him, Aesop rewards the behavior with a coin. This creates a false sense of ""success"" for the hooligan.
3.  **The Trap:** Encouraged by his initial success, the hooligan believes that repeating his behavior on a more powerful target will lead to an even greater reward.
4.  **The Outcome:** The hooligan’s ""reckless daring"" and the expectation of further reward lead him to commit a crime against a social superior, resulting in his execution.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A) Success leads many astray to their ruin:** This fits perfectly. The initial ""success"" (getting a coin from Aesop) gave the hooligan a false sense of security and validation, which led him to perform a fatal action.
- **B) Be careful what you wish for:** The hooligan didn't necessarily ""wish"" for something that backfired; he actively pursued a reward through aggression.
- **C) Clever minds outwit reckless wealth:** While Aesop is clever, the second man is described as wealthy, and the hooligan is the one who is reckless. This doesn't capture the core lesson.
- **D) Avoid reckless overindulgence in manipulative pursuits:** This is too wordy and doesn't quite fit the hooligan's simple greed/aggression.
- **E) Responding with grace can disarm hostility:** Aesop didn't act with ""grace"" to forgive; he acted with ""cunning"" to ensure the boy was punished by a higher authority.

In Phaedrus's collection of Aesop's fables, this specific story (Fable 3.5) is used to illustrate that early success in wrongdoing often emboldens a person to continue until they meet a disastrous end.

morables_584,"Winter made fun of Spring and mocked her for the fact that as soon as spring appears, nobody can keep still: some people go off to the meadows or into the woods, others like to gather flowers and lili",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the themes presented:

1.  **Winter's Argument:** Winter prides itself on its power, comparing itself to a ""dictator or a despot."" Winter enjoys the fact that it forces people to tremble, stay indoors, and look at the ground. It equates authority with fear and control.
2.  **Spring's Argument:** Spring highlights the joy, freedom, and beauty it brings. People seek out Spring, travel, and celebrate its arrival.
3.  **The Rebuttal:** Spring points out that because Winter rules through fear and restriction, people want to ""get rid of"" it. Conversely, because Spring brings pleasure, people remember it fondly and give thanks for its return.

The central conflict is between a ruler (or entity) that is ""feared"" (Winter) and one that is ""loved"" (Spring). The story concludes that while the ""despot"" might have control, it is the benevolent entity that is truly valued and welcomed.

*   **A) It is better to be loved than feared:** This directly aligns with the contrast between Winter’s boast of being a ""despot"" and Spring’s observation that people are glad to be rid of Winter but give thanks for Spring.
*   **B), C), D), and E):** These options either focus on blame, the neutrality of power, wasted talent, or finding beauty in harshness—none of which are the primary focus of the dialogue's conclusion regarding the value of kindness over tyranny.

The fable teaches that influence gained through affection and joy is superior to influence gained through fear and intimidation.

morables_655,"A Soldier who already had one excellent horse bought another that was not nearly as good, yet he took more care of the new one than the first. Everyone wondered at this, since the new horse was neithe",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Characters/Action:** A Soldier owns one excellent horse and buys a second one that is inferior (less beautiful, less useful).
2.  **The Paradox:** Despite the new horse's lack of merit, the Soldier showers it with more care and attention than the proven, superior horse.
3.  **The Explanation:** The story concludes with the observation that ""it's natural to be fond of the newest arrival."" 
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates a common human failing: the tendency to be distracted by novelty or ""the new,"" often at the expense of something far more valuable and reliable that we already possess. We frequently misplace our priorities by doting on something new and inferior while neglecting the superior thing that truly deserves our care.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A:** While the story mentions a preference for the ""newest arrival,"" it doesn't explicitly focus on how that feeling eventually fades (the ""long term""), but rather on the current misplacement of value.
*   **B:** There is no mention of ""disaster"" or being satisfied with one's ""lot"" in a general sense.
*   **C:** The story actually shows the Soldier *ignoring* usefulness in favor of something less useful.
*   **D:** This is irrelevant to the context of the Soldier and his horses.
*   **E:** This directly summarizes the Soldier's behavior—giving more care to the inferior horse (less worthy) than the excellent horse (what truly deserves care).

morables_423,"A seagull having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die. A Kite saw him and exclaimed: 'You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no bus",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Event**: A seagull (a bird traditionally associated with the shore/sky) attempts to consume a fish too large for it. This physical overextension leads to its death.
2.  **The Interpretation by the Kite**: The Kite observes the dying seagull and offers a critical judgment. The Kite’s moral is that the seagull suffered because it stepped outside of its natural ""domain"" (the air) to seek food from another domain (the sea).
3.  **Historical Context**: This fable is attributed to Aesop. Historically, the moral attached to this specific fable (often titled ""The Kite and the Seagull"" or ""The Seagull and the Kite"") focuses on the idea that individuals should stick to their own spheres of expertise or nature.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) Every man should be content to mind his own business.** This aligns with the Kite's observation that the bird of the air should not have meddled with the sea. In archaic English, ""mind his own business"" often referred to staying within one's own proper sphere or occupation.
*   **B) Learn from past misfortunes.** This doesn't fit, as the seagull dies and cannot learn from the experience.
*   **C) Greed breeds misfortune...** While the seagull was greedy, the specific commentary provided by the Kite focuses on the crossing of boundaries (air vs. sea).
*   **D) How often do we supply our unfortunate enemies...** This moral belongs to the fable of the Eagle and the Arrow.
*   **E) Patience is key...** This is not relevant to the sudden burst of the seagull's gullet.

The Kite’s dialogue explicitly points to the seagull operating outside its ""business"" or natural station. Therefore, option A is the most accurate representation of the lesson within the context of Aesop's fables.

They urged one another to approach the river, but no one dared to get too close bec",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Situation:** A group of foxes is thirsty but afraid of a rushing river.
2.  **The Action:** One fox, motivated by a desire to ""embarrass her fellow foxes"" and show off her bravery, leaps into the dangerous current.
3.  **The Consequence:** The current sweeps her away, placing her in a life-threatening situation.
4.  **The Irony:** When her companions mockingly ask her to come back and help them, she makes up an excuse (carrying a message to Miletus) to hide the fact that she is helpless and dying.

**Analysis of the Options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The fox's boasting and desire to show off led her to take an unnecessary risk that resulted in her being swept away by the river.
*   **B:** The story is about ego and bravado, not financial greed or profit.
*   **C:** This is the opposite of the story's outcome; the fox's ""boldness"" led to her demise, not a successful drink.
*   **D:** While the fox was mocking her neighbors, the primary lesson is about her own self-inflicted trouble through bravado.
*   **E:** The story portrays her ""courage"" (actually recklessness) as foolish, not as a positive trait needed to quench thirst.

The story serves as a warning against ""vainglory"" or boasting. The fox puts herself in a situation she cannot control just to appear superior to others, and even as she faces her end, she tries to maintain the facade of her boast.

morables_251,"When the lion made himself king of the beasts, he wanted to be known for his fairness, so he gave up his old habits and contented himself with a limited diet just as the other animals did, committed t",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the plot and the outcomes for the characters:

1.  **The Lion's Dilemma**: The lion wants to appear just and fair, but his biological nature (the desire to eat meat) conflicts with his resolution. To satisfy his appetite while maintaining a facade of fairness, he creates ""trap"" questions.
2.  **The First Strategy**: He asks animals if his breath smells. If they say ""yes"" (honesty), he kills them. If they say ""no"" (flattery/politeness), he kills them. The result is the same regardless of their answer.
3.  **The Monkey's Strategy**: The monkey tries extreme flattery, comparing the lion's breath to the ""altar of the gods."" While this saves him momentarily by making the lion ""ashamed,"" it does not change the lion's ultimate goal.
4.  **The Outcome**: The lion simply invents a new excuse (feigning illness) to eat the monkey anyway.

**Evaluating the Choices:**
*   **A**: This captures the essence of the first part of the story, but the story goes further to show that even *creative* flattery (the monkey's choice) doesn't save one from a predator.
*   **B**: Irrelevant; there are no ""old friends"" vs. ""new acquaintances"" themes.
*   **C**: This is tempting, but in this specific story, the flattery comes from the *victim* (the monkey), not the predator. The lion's intentions were already ruthless.
*   **D**: This focuses on the monkey's ""silly words,"" but the crux of the story is that the monkey's words didn't matter—the lion was determined to eat.
*   **E**: This describes the lion's *stated* goal at the beginning, but the story is a subversion of this idea, showing that his ""integrity"" was a sham.

The most accurate moral for this specific fable (a variation of an Aesop/Phaedrus fable) is that when someone in power is determined to do harm or satisfy their greed, no answer—be it the truth, a lie, or silence—will protect the victim. While A focuses on ""speaking/silence,"" in the context of these fables, it represents the idea that your response doesn't matter when the outcome is predetermined by the predator. However, looking at the monkey's specific end, the lesson is that **flattery is no protection against a tyrant.**

Among the choices provided, **A** most closely aligns with the traditional moral assigned to this specific fable type (The Lion, the Elephant, and the Animals), which illustrates that no matter how you answer a tyrant, you are at risk.

The partridge immediately started squawking his usual song, sauntering through every room in the house un",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the conflict between the characters:

1.  **The Characters:** A partridge (a newcomer) and a weasel (a long-time resident).
2.  **The Action:** The partridge enters a new home and immediately becomes loud and boisterous (""squawking,"" ""sauntering,"" and ""cackling"").
3.  **The Conflict:** The weasel, who characterizes itself as a ""mouser-slayer"" and a veteran of the household, rebukes the partridge. The weasel’s point is that despite being a native and a powerful predator, it remains quiet and humble, whereas the partridge is acting entitled and loud despite having just arrived.
4.  **The Theme:** The fable focuses on the social interaction between a new arrival and an established resident. The weasel’s critique centers on the partridge's lack of humility and failure to observe the established ""quiet"" or hierarchy of the house.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A:** Addresses the core of the weasel's complaint—that a newcomer should observe how things are done (quietly/humbly) before making a spectacle of themselves.
*   **B:** Irrelevant to the plot.
*   **C:** The partridge is not outsmarting the weasel; in fact, the weasel is positioning itself as superior.
*   **D:** While the partridge is vain, ""self-destruction"" is not explicitly depicted in this snippet (though weasels eat partridges, the text ends with the rebuke).
*   **E:** While the partridge is ""loose,"" the lesson is social, not philosophical regarding freedom.

The weasel essentially tells the partridge: ""I've been here longer and I'm quiet; you've just arrived and are making a racket."" This is a lesson in social etiquette for newcomers.

Stung by the sharp pain,",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Situation:** The fox is in a moment of vulnerability (slipping) and reaches out for support to save herself.
2.  **The Action:** She grabs a bramble bush. By nature, a bramble bush is covered in thorns and ""grabs"" or hooks onto anything that touches it.
3.  **The Result:** Instead of being helped, the fox is injured by the thorns.
4.  **The Lesson/Dialogue:** The fox complains about the cruelty, but the bramble points out that it was the fox's mistake to expect something gentle or helpful from an entity whose nature is to be prickly and ""grab"" (harm) others.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A)** This aligns with the bramble's reply. The bramble is inherently harmful/prickly; the fox was ""out of her mind"" to expect help from something with that nature.
*   **B)** This refers to boasting, which is not present in this story.
*   **C)** While cruelty does sting, this is a literal observation of the plot rather than the broader moral lesson about the fox's choice.
*   **D)** This refers to a common theme in the ""Fox and the Cat"" fable, but doesn't apply here.
*   **E)** This is a plausible secondary lesson, but the primary traditional moral of Aesop’s ""The Fox and the Bramble"" focuses on the folly of the seeker expecting a change in nature from the source of help.

Option **A** is the most accurate moral: the fable warns against turning to those who are known to be harmful or ill-natured and expecting them to act against their nature to help you.

But the fuller told him, 'How on earth would I be able to carr",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the characters and their conflict:

1.  **The Charcoal Burner:** His profession involves soot, dust, and blackening substances.
2.  **The Fuller:** His profession involves cleaning and whitening cloth.
3.  **The Conflict:** The fuller refuses to live with the charcoal burner because the fundamental nature of their work is contradictory. The charcoal burner’s byproduct (soot) would actively destroy the fuller's finished product (clean white cloth).

**Step-by-step evaluation of the options:**
*   **A) Opposites are utterly incompatible:** This fits the narrative perfectly. The story demonstrates that people with diametrically opposed interests or ways of life cannot successfully combine their households because one will inevitably interfere with the other.
*   **B) Appearances can be deceiving:** There is no deception here; both men are honest about what they do.
*   **C & D):** While ""caution"" is present in the fuller's decision, the phrasing of these options is nonsensical or irrelevant to the specific dynamic of the soot vs. cleaning.
*   **E) Shared spaces require shared understanding:** While true in a general sense, the story focuses more on the inherent impossibility of the arrangement rather than a lack of communication.

The traditional moral of this Aesop's fable is that ""like should associate with like"" or that ""opposites are incompatible.""

Some travellers coming from the opposite direction asked the man how he",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Action:** A murderer attempts to hide his guilt by lying to travelers, claiming his bloody hands are merely stained from climbing a mulberry tree.
2.  **The Slander:** In making this excuse, the murderer ""blames"" the mulberry tree for the blood on his hands, effectively slandering an innocent object to save himself.
3.  **The Resolution:** The murderer is caught and executed on that very same tree.
4.  **The Closing Statement:** The tree speaks, noting that it has no qualms about assisting in the execution because the man tried to ""smear"" (slander) it with his own crime.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Focusing on the tree as a symbol for an ""honest"" entity, this option highlights that even the naturally passive or innocent will not hesitate to see justice done to those who have slandered them or tried to shift blame onto them. This aligns with the tree's final speech.
*   **B:** The story is about justice and accountability, not stoicism or equanimity.
*   **C:** While travelers were curious, the capture was due to his pursuers, not just curiosity.
*   **D:** This moral (often associated with ""The Stag and His Antlers"") focuses on greed and vanity, which are not the primary themes here.
*   **E:** While theme-relevant, it doesn't capture the irony of the tree's role in the punishment as described in the text.

In many classical collections of Aesop's Fables (where this story originates), the moral appended to this specific fable (The Murderer and the Mulberry Tree) is that innocent people (represented by the tree) are righteously indignant when someone attempts to frame them for a crime.

The lion woke up and immediately grabbed the wretched little mouse with his paw,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the relationship between the characters:

1.  **The Act of Mercy:** The lion, a powerful animal, chooses to spare a tiny mouse rather than kill it. He shows kindness to a creature that seems unable to ever help him in return.
2.  **The Reversal of Fortune:** The lion, despite his strength, becomes helpless when caught in a hunter's trap. 
3.  **The Repayment:** The mouse, remembering the lion's previous kindness (""I have not forgotten the kindness that you showed me!""), uses its specific skills (gnawing) to free the lion.
4.  **The Lesson:** The smallest and seemingly most insignificant creature was able to save the life of the most powerful one because of a previous act of mercy.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted:** This perfectly matches the theme. The lion's ""small"" act of letting the mouse live resulted in his own life being saved later.
*   **B) Unequal matches bring misery:** Incorrect; this match brought salvation, not misery.
*   **C) Cleverness can free the trapped:** While the mouse was effective, the story's focus is on the *gratitude* and the *return of a favor*, not just the method of escape.
*   **D) Those who act in their own innocent self-interest...:** Incorrect; the mouse was acting out of genuine gratitude.
*   **E) Even the smallest actions can awaken great consequences:** While partially true (the mouse running over the lion woke him up), it misses the primary ethical lesson regarding kindness and mercy found in Aesop's fables.

The classic moral of ""The Lion and the Mouse"" is that mercy brings its own reward and that even the smallest friend may one day prove to be a great ally.

1.  **The Situation:** The Pigeons are afraid of a predator (the Kite).
2.  **The Choice:** They seek protection from an even more powerful predator (the Hawk).
3.  **The Consequence:** While the Kite was a threat, the Hawk—once admitted into their home (the cote)—killed far more pigeons in a single day than the Kite would have killed in a year.
4.  **The Lesson:** The ""solution"" the Pigeons chose was far more destructive than the original problem they were trying to solve.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease:** This directly matches the outcome. The Hawk (the remedy) caused more damage than the Kite (the disease).
*   **B)** There is no conflict between the wicked mentioned; they are both predators of the pigeons.
*   **C)** While the Hawk was deceptive, the primary lesson focuses on the scale of the destruction caused by the chosen ""cure.""
*   **D)** This relates to legal or judicial fables (like those involving wolves and sheep in court).
*   **E)** This is a plausible modern interpretation, but traditional Aesop's fables focus on the irony of the ""remedy"" being worse than the original threat.

In classical literature and collections of Aesop's fables, this specific story is almost always used to illustrate that one should not seek a cure that is more dangerous than the ailment.

At first, the Earth refused to cooperate in Herm",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Origin:** Zeus creates humans and intends for them to survive by farming (digging in the Earth).
2.  **The Conflict:** Gaia (the Earth) is initially unwilling to allow this intrusion or to give up her resources freely. 
3.  **The Resolution:** Forced by divine command, Gaia yields, but she attaches a steep price to the provision of food: ""groans and tears.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story explains the transition from a state of nature to agricultural civilization. It suggests that while the Earth provides the sustenance necessary for life, it does not do so freely or easily. The act of ""obtaining food"" (survival/gain) is inextricably linked to ""groans and tears"" (toil, labor, and suffering).

Looking at the options:
- **A** suggests that gains (life/sustenance) come with costs (hardship/toil). This directly mirrors Earth’s final decree.
- **B** focuses on conflict/fighting, but the story is more about the nature of survival than a specific combat strategy.
- **C** is true in the context of Hermes compelling Gaia, but fables usually aim for a message applicable to human life (labor/survival) rather than just divine politics.
- **D** is irrelevant to the text.
- **E** focuses on the ""how-to"" of guidance, but the climax of the story is the warning about suffering, not the success of the lesson.

The fable serves as an explanation for why life and labor are difficult; even though we have the means to survive, those gains are earned through hardship.

The butcher turned around and said to him, 'You haven't stolen my heart; indeed, I have taken heart from this lesson! So if you eve",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s analyze the narrative and the characters' reactions:

1.  **The Event:** A dog steals a piece of meat (the heart) from a butcher. This is an act of opportunistic theft.
2.  **The Butcher’s Reaction:** Instead of simply being angry, the butcher uses a play on words regarding the ""heart."" He states that he has ""taken heart"" (gained courage or wisdom) from the experience.
3.  **The Outcome:** The butcher realizes his mistake in allowing the dog the opportunity to steal. He explicitly states that he has learned a lesson and will be prepared (cautious) to punish or prevent the dog from doing it again in the future.
4.  **The Lesson:** The focus of the story is on the butcher’s realization. He credits the negative experience with giving him the insight to be more vigilant. This aligns with the idea that one ""learns from experience.""

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Experience teaches valuable lessons and encourages caution:** This directly reflects the butcher’s statement about taking heart from the lesson and vowing to be ready next time.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** This applies to some animal fables but isn't the primary point of the butcher's dialogue.
*   **C) Boldness without caution leads astray:** While the dog was bold, the story concludes with the butcher's takeaway, not the dog's failure.
*   **D) Better to face a bold danger...:** This is the moral for ""The Wolf and the Crane"" or similar tales.
*   **E) Desire can lead to actions that betray trust:** The dog and butcher didn't have a relationship of trust to begin with.

1.  **The Conflict**: The young bullock mocked the older, hardworking bull for his heavy labor and burdensome life. The bullock felt superior because he was idle and free from the yoke.
2.  **The Turning Point**: When the time for sacrifice arrived, the hardworking bull was rewarded with rest (unyoked and led to pasture), while the idle bullock was led to his death.
3.  **The Resolution**: The older bull points out that the bullock's leisure was not a sign of favor, but a sign that he was being fattened for slaughter. The ""unfortunate"" labor of the old bull actually preserved his life.

The bullock laughed at the bull's misfortune early on, but in the end, the bull was the one left alive while the bullock faced a grim fate. This aligns perfectly with the proverb that those who celebrate prematurely or mock others' struggles often find the situation reversed in the end.

*   **Choice A** (""He laughs best that laughs last"") reflects this reversal of fortune and the danger of mocking someone when you don't know the final outcome.
*   **Choice B** is not supported, as it's a story about labor vs. sacrifice, not power.
*   **Choice C** is a byproduct of the story, but not the central proverb.
*   **Choice D** is nonsensical in this context.
*   **Choice E** is a good sentiment, but the fable focuses specifically on the ironic outcome of the bullock's mockery.

In traditional collections of Aesop's fables (where this story originates), the moral is frequently summarized as ""He laughs best who laughs last"" or ""Work is often safer than idleness.""

morables_174,It is common to take Maltese dogs and pet monkeys on long sea voyages in order to relieve the boredom of the passage. A man who was planning to make such a voyage had brought his monkey along with him,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the central conflict:

1.  **The Setting:** A monkey is being saved by a dolphin during a shipwreck.
2.  **The Lie:** The monkey pretends to be an Athenian of high social standing to impress the dolphin.
3.  **The Mistake:** When asked about Piraeus (a famous harbor), the monkey mistakenly assumes it is a person and claims to be close friends with ""him.""
4.  **The Consequence:** The dolphin realizes the monkey is a liar and a fraud. Because of this deception, the dolphin stops helping him and lets him drown (literally putting him in ""deep water"").

**Analysis of the options:**
*   **A:** This fits perfectly. The monkey pretended to be something he wasn't (a noble Athenian) and was caught in a lie, leading to his demise in the water. The phrase ""deep water"" functions both literally and as an idiom for trouble.
*   **B:** The story is about deception, not the quality of a crowd versus an individual.
*   **C:** The monkey's actions triggered infuriation, they did not calm it.
*   **D:** While the dolphin was infuriated and dangerous, the monkey was not telling the truth; he was lying. 
*   **E:** The companionship failed specifically because the monkey was untrustworthy; the ""strength"" of the dolphin was withdrawn due to the lie.

The story serves as a warning against boasting and dishonesty, especially when one is already in a vulnerable position.

morables_25,"A Certain House was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this, made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the steps and the message:

1.  **Summary of the Plot**: A Cat is successfully hunting Mice. To avoid being eaten, the Mice retreat to their holes (becoming cautious after witnessing the Cat's initial success). The Cat then attempts to deceive the Mice by playing dead (pretending to be an inanimate object).
2.  **The Turning Point**: The Mice investigate but refuse to approach because they have already learned the Cat's nature. Even when the Cat disguises herself as something harmless (like a meal-bag), the Mice recognize the danger based on their previous experience.
3.  **The Lesson**: The Mice have been ""deceived"" by the Cat's presence/danger before, or they have witnessed her threat. Having experienced the danger once, they are now extremely wary of any trick she tries to play. They are ""doubly cautious"" because they know the character of their enemy.

**Evaluation of options**:
*   **A) He who is once deceived is doubly cautious**: This matches the Mice's behavior perfectly. They have seen the Cat's danger and refuse to fall for her subsequent trickery.
*   **B) Powerful and deceitful collaborate**: There is no collaboration here; it is a predator vs. prey dynamic.
*   **C) Caution tempers cunning**: While true, it is less specific than A in describing how prior experience creates that caution.
*   **D) Cunning subordinates**: There are no subordinates in this story.
*   **E) Unchecked problems**: This focuses on the homeowner's perspective, whereas fables usually focus on the interaction between the primary characters (Cat vs. Mice).

The standard moral for this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Cat and the Mice"") is that the wise are not fooled by those who have already shown themselves to be dangerous.

Just as he was about to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him and wak",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the situation:

1.  **The Situation:** A traveler chooses to sleep on the very brink of a deep well—an inherently dangerous location.
2.  **The Intervention:** Dame Fortune wakes him, not out of pure altruism, but to protect her own reputation.
3.  **The Lesson:** Dame Fortune explicitly states that when people suffer calamities due to their own ""folly"" (like choosing a dangerous place to sleep), they unfairly blame ""Fortune"" or bad luck rather than their own poor decisions.
4.  **The Conclusion:** The story emphasizes that individuals are responsible for the outcomes of their actions. While people like to blame luck or fate for their misfortunes, those misfortunes are often the result of their own choices.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) Everyone is more or less master of his own fate:** This aligns perfectly with the idea that our own actions and ""follies"" determine our outcomes more than luck does.
*   **B) Every tale is not to be believed:** This is unrelated to the context.
*   **C) Guard your energy wisely:** While the traveler was tired, the story focuses on the *location* of his rest and the *blame* associated with the outcome, not the management of energy.
*   **D) He who incites to concerned strife...:** This is the moral for a different fable (The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner).
*   **E) Exhaustion can lead to perilous oversight:** While true in a literal sense, it misses the philosophical point made by Dame Fortune regarding responsibility and blame.

The classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable (The Traveler and Fortune) is that we often blame luck for disasters caused by our own imprudence. Therefore, option A is the best fit.

The man took the handle and fitted it to his axe. The",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Request:** A man creates the head of an axe but cannot use it without a handle. He asks the trees for help.
2.  **The Cooperation:** The trees, acting in a helpful or perhaps naive manner, provide him with a handle made of hard wood (wild olive).
3.  **The Consequence:** Once the man has a functional tool, he uses it to destroy the very entities (the trees) that helped him.
4.  **The Realization:** The oak tree realizes that by providing the man with the means to harm them, they brought about their own destruction.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
*   **A:** This fits well, as the trees provided a weapon to an ""enemy"" (or potential threat) and suffered for it.
*   **B:** This is a bit convoluted and implies it's better to be hurt without a fight than to give power to someone else.
*   **C:** This is a very strong contender. The trees were generous in giving wood for the handle, but they lacked the wisdom to see how that generosity would be turned against them. Most classical interpretations of Aesop's ""The Woodman and the Trees"" emphasize that the first step in one's own destruction is often a misguided favor to a foe.
*   **D & E:** These do not align with the themes of the story.

Comparing **A** and **C**: While **A** is specific to the ""enemy,"" **C** captures the broader philosophical failure of the trees. However, in the context of standard Aesop’s Fables, the lesson usually focuses on the folly of providing your adversary with the means to destroy you. Option A directly addresses the tree's dialogue: ""It serves us right, since we gave our enemy the handle he asked for!""

The crab said to her, 'O mother, lead the way, and I will try to walk accordingly.",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Precept:** The mother crab gives her son a lecture (a precept) on how he should behave, telling him to walk straight instead of crookedly.
2.  **The Challenge:** The son asks the mother to demonstrate the behavior she is demanding of him (""lead the way"").
3.  **The Failure:** The mother is unable to perform the very task she commanded her son to do because it is contrary to her nature.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights that it is easy to give advice or commands, but difficult to follow them ourselves. It suggests that if you want someone to behave a certain way, you must be able to model that behavior yourself.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Example is more powerful than precept.** This fits perfectly. A ""precept"" is a rule or instruction. The story shows that the mother's instruction failed because her ""example"" (her actual movement) contradicted it.
*   **B) Contentment with our lot...** This is unrelated to the conflict between mother and son regarding behavior.
*   **C) Those who cannot see the path...** While the mother is guiding him poorly, the focus is specifically on her inability to do what she asks of him, not her lack of vision.
*   **D) Hypocritical equals...** The mother and son are not ""equals"" in a traditional social sense, and ""best accusatory friends"" doesn't capture the essence of the teaching.
*   **E) Even the crooked can find their way...** The story ends with failure and accusation, not success or guidance.

The moral is that you should not criticize others for faults you possess yourself; actions (examples) speak louder than words (precepts).

When the fox found out about this she paid a visit to the wolf a,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events and the characters' roles:

1.  **The Wolf:** He is a thief who has hoarded ""booty"" (stolen goods). He is also spiteful and rude to the fox, which triggers her revenge.
2.  **The Fox:** She is a deceiver. She first tries to trick the wolf out of his food, then betrays him to a shepherd to secure his death, and finally eats the stolen goods herself.
3.  **The Resolution:** The wolf is killed by the shepherd (the victim of his thefts), and the fox is eventually killed by hunters. The fox realizes at her death that she is being punished for causing the death of another.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **B, C, D, and E:** While parts of the story touch on deceit and spite, they do not capture the overarching theme of the protagonists being wrongdoers who ultimately meet their downfall.
- **A (Take pleasure when thieves destroy themselves):** This moral is a traditional interpretation of this Aesopic fable (specifically Perry Index 156/604). The story features two ""thieves"" (the wolf who stole the flock and the fox who betrayed him for gain). Both characters are villainous; the wolf's hoarding and spite lead to the fox’s betrayal, and the fox’s betrayal leads to her own eventual demise. The satisfaction of the story comes from seeing two predators/thieves eliminate one another.

In many classical collections, this fable is used to illustrate that when those who live by theft and trickery turn on each other and perish, it is a benefit to everyone else.

But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; ,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events step by step:

1.  **The First Favor:** The countryman sees the Eagle struggling with the Serpent and intervenes to save the Eagle's life. This is a selfless act of kindness toward the bird.
2.  **The Counter-Action:** The Serpent attempts to kill the man in revenge by poisoning his water.
3.  **The Second Favor:** The Eagle, recognizing that the man saved its life, intervenes just as the man is about to drink the poison. By knocking the horn out of his hand, the Eagle saves the man's life in return.

The story illustrates a cycle of gratitude. Because the man did something good for the Eagle, the Eagle did something good for the man. This is the classic definition of the proverb ""One good turn deserves another,"" meaning that a favor should be repaid with a favor. 

While the Serpent's actions involve revenge (related to choices C and D), the resolution of the story and the primary focus of the Eagle's intervention is the repayment of a debt of gratitude. Choice A is the standard moral associated with this Aesop's fable (*The Eagle and the Serpent*).

1.  **The Situation:** A guest Dog (an outsider) is invited to a feast by a resident Dog (an insider). He enters the house through a ""backdoor"" arrangement rather than as an official guest of the master.
2.  **The Outcome:** The Cook, representing the legitimate authority of the household, does not recognize the Dog as a legitimate guest. Because the Dog has no official right to be there, he is treated like a common stray or thief and thrown out of the window.
3.  **The Lesson:** The core of the fable deals with people who try to gain benefits (supper/access) through unofficial or ""backdoor"" channels. Such people have no legitimate standing, and when caught, they are evicted unceremoniously.
4.  **Evaluating the options:**
    *   **B, C, and E** do not fit the narrative arc of the Dog being thrown out.
    *   **D** relates to broken promises, but the resident Dog didn't necessarily deceive his friend; rather, the invitation itself was unauthorized.

He ordered that the bag of coins be brought to him as he was dying and then asked",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Character's Actions:** The man is described as ""miserly"" and his wealth is ""ill-gotten."" He spent his life sweating over a hoard of coins.
2.  **The Outcome for the Wealth:** The bag of coins informs him that his heirs will squander the money on vices (women and drink). This means his hard work and hoarding resulted in no lasting or positive legacy on Earth.
3.  **The Outcome for the Soul:** The bag also reveals that because of his actions (the greed and the ""ill-gotten"" nature of the money), his soul faces ""eternal torments"" from demons.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) A life of greed and hoarding wealth leads to misery:** While partially true, the story focuses specifically on the futility and the spiritual punishment resulting from the *source* and *nature* of the wealth.
*   **B)** Irrelevant to the text.
*   **C) Ill-gotten gains bring eternal torment:** This aligns directly with the dialogue in the story. The man's ""ill-gotten"" money serves as the instrument of his ruin, resulting in both the squandering of his legacy and the damnation of his soul as explicitly stated by the bag.
*   **D)** Irrelevant to the text.
*   **E) The fruits of toil may not always yield the intended legacy:** This covers the ""heirs squandering wealth"" part, but misses the central point about the ""ill-gotten"" nature of the wealth and the spiritual consequences emphasized in the climax of the story.

The most precise moral, covering both the earthly waste and the spiritual punishment described in the fable, is that wealth acquired unjustly (ill-gotten) leads to ruin and torment.

The city mouse finished his business in the country and by means of insistent inv,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Contrast of Settings**: The story establishes two lifestyles. The country mouse lives a humble, simple life (eating acorns), while the city mouse lives a life of luxury and abundance (delicacies).
2.  **The Conflict**: While enjoying the abundance of the city, the mice are interrupted by a human (the butler). The city mouse knows where to hide because he is ""acquainted"" with the dangers of his wealthy environment. The country mouse, however, is terrified and nearly caught because he is unfamiliar with the hazards that come with this luxury.
3.  **The Resolution/Dialogue**: The city mouse values the high quality of the food above all else. However, the country mouse realizes that the ""price"" of this food is constant fear and a lack of safety.
4.  **The Conclusion**: The country mouse chooses to return to his simple diet of acorns. He explicitly states that ""freedom"" (and by extension, peace of mind and security) is more valuable than ""delicious food"" if that food comes with life-threatening worry.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A**: Directly reflects the country mouse's realization. He prefers ""humble"" poverty because it is ""secure,"" whereas the city's ""wealth"" is accompanied by ""tormenting"" worries/fear.
*   **B**: Too vague; the story is specifically about the trade-off between luxury and peace.
*   **C**: This is a minor observation from the text (the city mouse was safer because he was familiar with the hole), but it is not the overarching lesson.
*   **D**: Irrelevant; there is no betrayal or ""thief"" in this story.
*   **E**: This describes the plot's inciting incident rather than the moral/lesson learned.

The beetle then felt contem",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the beetle’s actions and the outcome:

1.  **The Beetle's Attitude:** The beetle starts ""fully sated,"" but upon seeing the eagle, he becomes dissatisfied and contemptuous of his own nature. He boasts that his voice and beauty are equal to the eagle's and decides he is too good for his ""dung heap."" This represents **arrogance** and **putting on airs**.
2.  **The Actions:** He attempts to leave his natural environment and ""consort with birds,"" ignoring his physical limitations (being a ""bug"" rather than a ""bird"").
3.  **The Consequence:** He fails to keep up, is battered by the wind, and ends up far from home, starving and exhausted. 
4.  **The Realization:** He realizes his mistake and wishes only to return to his humble original position, having lost the comfort and security he once had.

Analysis of the options:
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the text. The beetle’s arrogance lead him to try and reach a higher status (""get promoted"" into the society of birds), which resulted in him failing and nearly losing his life and former security (""lose his former position"").
*   **B)** This moral belongs to a different Aesop fable (*The Eagle and the Beetle*), where the beetle actually gets revenge on an eagle. In *this* specific story, there is no vengeance.
*   **C)** The story is a cautionary tale *against* trying to be something you are not, rather than an encouragement of diversity.
*   **D)** This is a quote from Marlowe's *Edward II* regarding power, but it doesn't fit the beetle's failure to survive the flight.
*   **E)** While the beetle had a moment of wonder, the story emphasizes the disaster that followed his hubris, not the beauty of his inspiration.

The story teaches that one should be content with their nature and that overreaching through vanity leads to ruin.

1.  **The Conflict:** The protagonist finds an object of immense value (a golden lion), but his nature creates a paradox. He is greedy (desiring the gold) but also a coward (afraid of the lion's shape, even though it is made of inanimate gold). 
2.  **The Inaction:** His fear prevents him from directly claiming or enjoying the treasure. He describes it as a ""treasure that offers no satisfaction"" because his internal ""character urges [him] to keep away.""
3.  **The Resolution:** Instead of taking the gold himself, he plans to have others do the work while he watches from a safe distance, illustrating that his fear acts as a barrier between him and the benefit of the wealth.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Wealth is of little value if one is too afraid to use or enjoy it:** This directly addresses the man’s lament. Despite stumbling upon a literal fortune, his cowardice renders the discovery useless to him in the moment.
*   **B) Nature reveals itself:** While his nature is revealed, this is a generic observation rather than the central lesson about the gold.
*   **C) Greed blinds the cowardly:** He isn't ""blinded""; in fact, he is hyper-aware of his situation, which causes his distress.
*   **D) Better to serve...:** This doesn't fit the context of a man seeking to use servants to get gold.
*   **E) Indecision is the thief of opportunity:** While he is indecisive, the core obstacle is specifically his **cowardice** in the face of **wealth**, which aligns best with A.

This fable (often attributed to Aesop) is traditionally used to illustrate that for a coward, even a stroke of great luck or wealth becomes a source of torment rather than a benefit.

1.  **The Situation:** The animals gather to discuss grievances. The hares, representing the physically weak or ""inferior"" animals, propose a system of total equality and shared power so they won't be preyed upon by the ""superior"" animals.
2.  **The Argument:** The hares argue for fairness based on abstract principles of justice and dignity.
3.  **The Rebuttal:** The lions, who are the natural predators, acknowledge that the hares' ideas sound good in theory (""Your words... are good""). However, they point out a physical reality: the hares lack the ""claws and teeth"" (the power and means) to enforce or sustain such a system.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable illustrates that high-minded ideals and arguments for equality mean little if you do not have the power or means to back them up or defend your position against those who hold actual power. While the hares want equality, the lions point out that without strength, the hares cannot compel the strong to change.

Among the choices provided:
*   **A** directly addresses the need for the ""claws and teeth"" (the means to defend a position) mentioned by the lions.
*   **B** and **E** are generic moral lessons not supported by the cynical ending of this specific fable.
*   **C** and **D** represent the hares' perspective, but the fable ends with the lions' pragmatism, which serves as the ""reality check"" or the lesson of the story.

3.  **The Liar’s Reward:** The liar recognizes the leader's vanity and uses flattery (lies) to exploit it. He is rewarded because his deception aligns with the leader's delusions.
4.  **The Truth-teller’s Miscalculation:** The truth-teller assumes that objective truth is inherently valuable or rewarding to all listeners, regardless of their nature.

*   **A:** This fits the narrative perfectly. The monkeys ""thrive on deception"" (the ego-trip) and ""retaliate"" against the truth-teller because his honesty shatters their illusion.
*   **B:** While true in life, the story focuses more on the response to truth vs. lies rather than the difficulty of knowing a person.
*   **C:** Flattery did deceive the monkeys, but the primary moral focus is on the punishment of the truth-teller compared to the reward of the liar.
*   **D:** This is irrelevant to the plot of vanity and retaliation.
*   **E:** The story proves the opposite—truth was not a defense; it led to an attack.

The fable serves as a warning that in a society or context built on lies and ego, the truth is often treated as an offense rather than a virtue.

This slave-woman, bedecked with gold and trailing a delicate purple robe aro",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative elements:

1.  **The Premise:** A man is inexplicably infatuated with a woman described as both ""ugly"" and ""wicked."" He treats her as a social superior, showering her with gifts that she uses to harass his wife.
2.  **The Slave-woman's Perspective:** She believes her luck is a divine gift from Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty, suggesting she thinks she has been made desirable or favored by the goddess.
3.  **The Goddess’s Intervention:** Aphrodite explicitly rejects the slave-woman’s gratitude. She clarifies that she did *not* make the woman beautiful. 
4.  **The Core Lesson:** Aphrodite expresses ""fury"" toward the situation. By saying she is angry that the man even thinks the woman is ""worth looking at,"" the story implies that the man’s attraction is unnatural, a delusion, or a sign of divine displeasure/insanity.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Matches the goddess's indignation. In Greek fables (specifically Aesop's, where this story originates), a man being attracted to something objectively ""wicked and ugly"" is seen as a sign of being ""out of his mind"" or cursed.
*   **B:** There is no mention of a guilty conscience.
*   **C:** Generosity (the man's gifts) is what causes the trouble and arrogance, it doesn't ""outshine"" ugliness.
*   **D:** The woman is not ""beautiful,"" as the goddess herself points out.
*   **E:** The story explicitly describes the woman as ""wicked,"" so there is no internal beauty to be found.

The fable serves as a commentary on the irrationality of certain attractions and the idea that when someone loves something unworthy, it is a sign of a clouded mind or a lack of divine favor.

morables_134,A father had an unmanageable son who indulged his vicious adolescent temper by brutally whipping the slaves whenever his father wasn't looking. Aesop therefore shared this little story with the father,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Context:** A father has a son with a ""vicious adolescent temper"" who is causing harm to others (the slaves).
2.  **The Analogy:** Aesop tells a story about a farmer yoking an old, experienced bull to a young, violent bull.
3.  **The Purpose of the Yoke:** The farmer explains that the old bull is not there to perform heavy labor, but to serve as a literal and figurative restraint. By being tied to the older bull, the younger bull is physically prevented from ""kicking and butting"" and causing further injury.
4.  **The Application:** Aesop tells the father that he must keep the boy beside him so that his own ""moderation"" (the wisdom and calmness that comes with age) can ""restrain his reckless inclinations.""

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) A mild disposition can put a stop to vicious behavior:** This is very close, as the ""moderation"" of the elder is meant to stop the ""vicious"" behavior of the youth.
*   **B) Do not mock the feelings of old age:** This is irrelevant to the lesson taught to the father.
*   **C) Wisdom tempers reckless aggression:** This captures the essence of the ""old bull"" (wisdom/moderation) balancing the ""young bull"" (aggression). The story specifically emphasizes using the calm influence of the elder to ""restrain"" the violence of the younger.
*   **D) Slow and steady wins the race:** This refers to the Tortoise and the Hare, not this fable.
*   **E) Unchecked behavior in youth can lead to greater harm:** While true in the story, the primary ""moral"" or advice given by Aesop is the **solution** (pairing the wise with the reckless), rather than just a warning about the consequences.

In Aesopic fables, the moral usually describes the mechanism of the solution provided in the story. The farmer (and Aesop) suggests that the presence of a calm, experienced figure acts as a corrective force for a violent one. This makes **A** the most accurate description of the specific lesson: how a moderate, mild temperament can restrain and eventually end viciousness.

All the other passengers started to swim, but the Athenian kept praying to Athena, maki",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation**: A ship capsizes in a storm. The passengers are in a life-threatening situation.
2.  **The Contrast**: One passenger (the wealthy Athenian) relies solely on divine intervention, praying and making promises to a goddess instead of physically trying to save himself. The other passengers are actively swimming to survive.
3.  **The Message**: A fellow passenger points out the flaw in the Athenian's logic: prayer or faith should not replace personal action. You must help yourself while seeking help from others (or the gods).
4.  **The Traditional Moral**: This fable is the origin of the famous proverb, ""Athena helps those who move their own arms,"" commonly known today as ""God helps those who help themselves.""

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A) Self-effort is essential**: This directly aligns with the message that one must act (move their arms) to survive, rather than just waiting for external rescue.
*   **B) A learned man has always a fund of riches in himself**: This is the moral of a different Aesop fable (*Simonides Saved by Gods/The Shipwrecked Simonides*), not this one.
*   **C) True power lies in practicality**: While related, it is not as precise as the necessity of personal effort.
*   **D) Powerful opposites are utterly divine and incompatible**: This does not reflect the story's theme.
*   **E) True character is revealed when the tides turn**: While the Athenian's character (passivity/helplessness) is shown, the specific lesson is about the necessity of action.

Conclusion: The story emphasizes that divine help or luck is no substitute for personal exertion.

1.  **The Conflict:** The Frog and the Mouse are so consumed by their rivalry over a small territory (the marsh) that they decide to engage in a duel to the death.
2.  **The Distraction:** Because they are ""in earnest"" and focused entirely on each other, they are completely unaware of their surroundings.
3.  **The Consequence:** A Kite (a predatory bird) sees them from a distance. Because they are preoccupied with their fight, they are easy targets. The Kite swoops down and takes both of them.
4.  **The Lesson:** The ""prize"" (the sovereignty of the marsh) is lost to both of them, and a third party (the Kite) benefits from their foolishness.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) When fools fight others run away with the prize.** This is the classic moral associated with this Aesop's fable (often titled ""The Frog and the Mouse"" or ""The Mouse, the Frog, and the Kite""). It highlights how internal strife allows an outsider to swoop in and take everything.
*   **B)** Neither the Frog nor the Mouse intended ""harm"" in a malicious sense; they were rivals for territory.
*   **C)** While true, it is less specific to the ""fighting"" aspect of the story.
*   **D)** This applies to the Kite, but fables usually focus on the mistakes of the protagonists.
*   **E)** This is a very strong modern interpretation, but in the context of classical fables, the emphasis is usually on the ""third party"" benefiting from the conflict.

The surviving daughter wondered to see strangers so much concerned at the loss of her sister, and he",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A mother has lost a daughter. She hires professional mourners for the funeral while the family members appear relatively composed.
2.  **The Question:** The surviving daughter is confused by the social display. She notices that strangers (the hired mourners) seem more distraught than the actual family members who loved the deceased.
3.  **The Explanation:** The mother explains the pragmatism behind the display. The family gains nothing by public weeping (their grief is private or ""never the better for crying""), whereas the strangers act distraught because they are being paid to do so.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable highlights the difference between genuine emotion and performative emotion. It specifically points out that the intensity of a public display is often tied to financial compensation rather than true feeling.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Professional mourners serve those who pay the most:** This aligns directly with the mother's explanation (""the strangers have money for it""). It addresses the irony that the most visible ""grief"" is bought.
*   **B) More good in one man than a crowd:** This does not fit the context of paid performance vs. private grief.
*   **C) Curiosity thrives on observation:** While the daughter is curious, this is a minor plot point, not the moral of the fable.
*   **D) Pragmatic temptation... compromise integrity:** This is too complex and moralistic for this specific fable, which is more about the reality of hired labor/customs.
*   **E) Grief can unite strangers:** The story explicitly states the strangers are not united in ""shared sorrow"" but are motivated by money.

The fable explores the transactional nature of public mourning.

1.  **The Characters:** We have a traveler and a personification of ""Truth.""
2.  **The Setting:** Truth is found in the ""wilderness"" or ""desert,"" far away from human cities.
3.  **The Conflict:** Truth explains that she has been exiled or driven out of society because she no longer has a place there.
4.  **The Reasoning:** Truth states that in ancient times, lies were rare (""found among only a few""), but in the present day, lies have ""spread throughout all of human society.""

The core lesson is a commentary on the state of humanity: Truth cannot live in the city because society has become entirely dishonest. Therefore, Truth is isolated because falsehood is now universal among men.

*   **Option A** directly reflects the story's conclusion: ""Falsehood is with all men.""
*   **Option B** deals with vanity and divinity, which are not mentioned.
*   **Option C** focuses on the traveler's curiosity, but the story's weight is on Truth's explanation of society, not the traveler’s discovery.
*   **Option D** deals with fear of the unknown, which is irrelevant to the dialogue.
*   **Option E** focuses on compassion, while the story is actually a cynical observation about dishonesty.

This fable (attributed to Aesop) is intended to highlight the prevalence of deceit in the world.

As the ox stru",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** Two animals, the donkey and the ox, are yoked together to share a single task. This establishes a relationship of mutual dependency.
2.  **The Conflict:** The ox is injured but works hard, while the donkey refuses to help. The donkey believes that by avoiding the work, he is benefiting himself.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because the donkey did not share the burden, the ox died of exhaustion. Consequently, the donkey ended up having to carry the entire original load plus the heavy weight of the ox's carcass.
4.  **The Resolution:** The donkey, unable to handle the burden he refused to share earlier, dies.
5.  **The Lesson:** The birds explicitly point out that if the donkey had helped his partner (the neighbor/peer), he would have survived.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the outcome. By failing to help a teammate or neighbor, their portion of the weight eventually becomes your sole responsibility, often leading to your own downfall. This matches the plot perfectly.
*   **B:** This is a general proverb about results, but it doesn't capture the specific dynamic of cooperation vs. selfishness shown here.
*   **C:** Hard work did not triumph in this story; both animals ended up dead.
*   **D:** While true in a literal sense, it is too vague to be the moral.
*   **E:** This focuses on the nature of strength, whereas the story focuses on the consequences of selfishness in a shared task.

The story teaches that selfishness in a shared endeavor is self-defeating because the burden of the fallen must eventually be carried by the survivor.

1.  **The Origin:** The fable states that Man was created in a hurry, resulting in the omission of ""modesty"" from his internal composition.
2.  **The Solution:** Jupiter decides to release Modesty as an external force among the crowd since it cannot be added internally piece by piece.
3.  **The Condition:** Modesty agrees to exist among humanity under one specific condition: she will not stay in the company of ""carnal love."" She explicitly states, ""wherever that comes... I'm gone.""
4.  **The Relationship:** The story defines a mutually exclusive relationship between these two concepts. When carnal love is present, modesty departs.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Modesty and carnal love cannot survive together:** This directly reflects the concluding dialogue and the central condition set by Modesty in the fable.
*   **B) We must not require what is unreasonable:** While Jupiter's task was difficult, the story's climax is about the condition set by Modesty, not the nature of the request.
*   **C) Haste can lead to unwelcome outcomes:** While the story mentions haste led to the omission, the resolution and final ""lesson"" focus on the behavior of Modesty.
*   **D) Do not unmodestly mock...:** This is irrelevant to the text provided.
*   **E) Virtues shared are virtues gained:** This contradicts the nature of the fable, which suggests a struggle for modesty to exist alongside certain human impulses.

The core lesson is found in the final sentence, where Modesty establishes her boundary: she and carnal love are incompatible.

1.  **Setting the Scene:** A fox and a monkey are traveling together. They enter a cemetery, a place filled with the silent dead.
2.  **The Action:** The monkey makes a grandiose claim, boasting that the people buried there were once the freedmen (former slaves) of his ancestors. This is an obvious lie intended to make himself seem more upper-class and important.
3.  **The Conflict/Reaction:** The fox immediately recognizes the deception. However, the fox’s response highlights *why* the monkey chose this specific moment to lie: because the people he is talking about are dead and cannot speak up to clarify the truth.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fox points out that the monkey is taking advantage of a situation where there are no witnesses to contradict him. The story illustrates that people who want to lie or boast about their status often wait for moments when their claims cannot be verified or challenged by those involved.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A:** Directly addresses the fox's observation that the monkey is using the silence of the dead to tell a lie without fear of rebuttal.
*   **B:** Irrelevant; there is no mention of loyalty or old/new friends.
*   **C:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific nuance of using a ""safe"" environment (the cemetery) to lie.
*   **D:** This is more about the consequences of lying, whereas the story is about the *opportunity* taken to lie.
*   **E:** While they are on a shared path, the focus is on the lie itself, not the journey.

The most accurate moral is that deceivers choose circumstances where their falsehoods cannot be challenged.

1.  **The Act of Kindness**: The Farmer performs a selfless act of compassion by warming a frozen Snake in his own bosom to save its life.
2.  **The Result**: Instead of showing gratitude, the Snake follows its ""natural instincts"" and bites the Farmer, killing him.
3.  **The Lesson**: The Farmer realizes too late that his kindness could not change the inherent nature of a ""scoundrel."" No matter how much mercy or help is provided to someone who is fundamentally malicious or ungrateful, their nature remains the same, and they may still harm their benefactor.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful**: This perfectly matches the story. The Farmer’s great kindness (saving the life) did not stop the Snake from biting him.
*   **B) The man who treats others well is rewarded by gratitude**: The story shows the exact opposite.
*   **C) Gratitude prevents regret**: No gratitude was shown, leading to total regret.
*   **D) Injuries may be regretfully forgiven, but not ungratefully forgotten**: This suggests the victim is the one doing the forgetting/forgiving; the story focuses more on the nature of the perpetrator.
*   **E) Even in the coldest times, a touch of compassion can revive what seems lost**: While literal to the plot, a moral should address the consequence of that revival, which was negative in this context.

The traditional moral of Aesop's ""The Farmer and the Viper"" is that kindness to the evil is ill-bestowed and will not change their nature.

1.  **The Situation:** The blacksmiths are engaged in loud, heavy labor (clanging hammers). Despite the noise, the dog stays asleep, showing complete indifference to the work or the needs of the household.
2.  **The Change:** As soon as the sound of eating occurs—a much quieter sound, but one that directly benefits the dog (potential scraps or food)—the dog wakes up immediately and acts friendly.
3.  **The Lesson:** The blacksmiths point out the hypocrisy of the dog: he can ignore loud noises that don't concern him, but is hyper-sensitive to quiet noises that represent a personal gain.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the story. The dog is ""inattentive"" to the work (the hammers) because it doesn't benefit him, but ""quickly notices"" the meal because it is his ""immediate concern.""
*   **B)** This refers to agency and delegation, which is not present here.
*   **C)** While the story contrasts laziness with the blacksmiths' work, the primary focus is on the dog's selective attention/opportunism rather than a general praise of diligence.
*   **D)** This is the moral of ""The Wolf and the Lamb,"" referring to tyranny, which is not the theme here.
*   **E)** The dog isn't adapting noise into harmony; he is ignoring one and focusing on the other for selfish reasons.

1.  **The setup:** The lion and the unicorn are chief enemies.
2.  **The deception:** The lion feigns illness and humility to trick the unicorn into giving up his only weapon (his horn).
3.  **The betrayal:** Once the unicorn is defenseless, the lion attacks him. 
4.  **The argument:** The lion justifies his actions by saying one should never show mercy to an enemy, while the unicorn argues that victory through treachery is dishonorable.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Do not ever trust your enemy...** This directly addresses the main plot point: the unicorn’s mistake was believing his ""chief enemy"" simply because he appeared ""humble and supplicating."" The lion’s successful ambush was only possible because the unicorn set aside his defenses.
*   **B) No matter how you brag...** Neither character is defined by bragging in this story.
*   **C) Trust cautiously, appearances deceive.** While partially true, it is less specific than A, which highlights the specific danger of trusting an *enemy*.
*   **D) Do unto trusting others...** This is a corruption of the Golden Rule and does not represent a moral lesson.
*   **E) True victory is achieved through honor, not deceit.** While this reflects the unicorn's final sentiment, the fable functions as a cautionary tale. The unicorn is ""laid low"" (defeated/killed), serving as a warning to the reader not to repeat his mistake of trusting a known adversary.

The strongest lesson in Aesopic-style fables involving enemies is the warning against misplaced trust in those who have reason to harm you.

1.  **The Situation:** The character is already a ""Prince"" in his own domain (the river), characterized by size, beauty, and strength.
2.  **The Flaw:** He is not satisfied with his status as the ruler of freshwater; he is ambitious and overreaches by trying to claim the sea.
3.  **The Conflict:** He encounters a force (the Dolphin) that is naturally more powerful in that foreign domain.
4.  **The Resolution:** He is humiliated and forced back to his original territory.
5.  **The Lesson:** He learns to stay within his own boundaries and be satisfied with the status he has in his own realm.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A) Be content with your lot:** This directly addresses the Pike’s dissatisfaction with his river kingdom and his subsequent realization that he belongs there.
- **B) Value is what others think of you...**: The story is about power and territory, not social reputation.

- **D) Ambitious counsel...**: There was no ""counsel"" involved; the Pike acted on his own ambition.
- **E) True leadership...**: The Pike was already a leader; the story focuses on his greed for more territory rather than his leadership style.

*   **B) There is little risk in being poor...:** This is irrelevant to the plot of this specific fable.
*   **C) Bravery outshines cowardice:** While true in a general sense, it doesn't capture the specific hypocrisy of the ""boastful coward"" which is the central theme.
*   **D) Know your aggressive, unreliable enemies:** The story is more about a ""fake"" friend/comrade than an enemy.
*   **E) Courage in adversity reveals true character:** This is a strong candidate, but the fable emphasizes the emptiness of the coward's **words** after the fact, making A a more precise fit for the dialogue provided.

In many classical collections of Aesop's Fables (where this story originates as ""The Two Soldiers and the Robber""), the moral is specifically aimed at those who are ""brave in words but cowards in deeds.""

They resented the fact that the Hoopoe had been given a higher seat of honor than the other birds because the Hoopoe was notable for its ,0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative elements:

1.  **The Situation:** The Eagle (the leader/host) grants the Hoopoe a seat of honor.
2.  **The Reasoning:** The Hoopoe is honored because of its superficial attributes—its impressive crown and multicolored feathers (outward appearance).
3.  **The Contrast:** The other birds resent this because, despite its beautiful appearance, the Hoopoe’s actual behavior and habits are foul (it spends its time in ""dung and filth"").
4.  **The Lesson:** The story highlights the conflict between outward beauty/prestige and inward character/habits. It suggests that honoring someone based solely on appearances is misguided when their actual nature is ignoble.

**Evaluation of options:**
- **A) True worth should be measured by character and deeds, not by outward appearances.** This directly addresses the contrast between the Hoopoe’s feathers and its filthy habits.
- **B)** Refers to the fable of the Eagle and the Beetle; not applicable here.
- **C)** While there is resentment, the story focuses more on *why* the resentment exists (the misplaced honor).
- **D)** There is no act of kindness described in the story.
- **E)** The story describes a hierarchy and exclusion/resentment rather than successful inclusivity.

The story teaches that superficial traits (the crown and feathers) do not compensate for a lack of integrity or hygiene in character.

A swallow saw what the hen was doing and said, 'O you stupid, senseless creature! They w",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action**: A hen (a bird associated with domesticity and care) finds snake eggs (predators) and treats them with devotion, nurturing them as if they were her own.
2.  **The Warning**: A swallow observes this and warns the hen that she is being ""stupid"" and ""senseless."" 
3.  **The Consequence**: The swallow explains that by hatching these eggs, the hen is creating creatures that will naturally turn on her and everyone else. The inherent nature of the snake (wicked/dangerous) does not change just because it serves someone's kindness or appears harmless while in the egg.
4.  **The Lesson**: The fable warns against nurturing or trusting things that are inherently dangerous or wicked, as their nature will ultimately lead them to destroy their benefactors.

Looking at the options:
*   **A** aligns with the warning: Nurturing a ""wicked"" thing (the snakes) is a mistake, regardless of how harmless they seem.
*   **B** refers to greed (like the dog and the shadow), which is not present here.
*   **C** is the opposite of the story's outcome; devotion creates danger here.
*   **D** refers to envy or competition, not applicable here.
*   **E** is a modern interpretation that the fable explicitly warns against as ""senseless.""

This fable is attributed to Aesop (The Hen and the Snake). The moral is that kindness shown to the wicked is a lost cause and will eventually be repaid with harm.

The jackdaw, however, could not stand to live in human society, so w",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Situation:** A jackdaw is captured and kept as a pet (a ""slave in human society"").
2.  **The Escape:** Seeking freedom, the jackdaw flees back to his natural habitat.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because he is still dragging the string from his captivity, he becomes entangled in his own nest and dies.
4.  **The Realization:** The bird recognizes that his attempt to change his condition (moving from the house to the wild) while still hampered by the remnants of his past situation led to a worse fate.

Now let's evaluate the options:
*   **A)** suggests that our internal state (mind) and how we handle our conditions dictate our outcome. In many traditional interpretations of Aesop’s fables (this story is ""The Jackdaw and the String""), the bird’s restlessness and inability to accept his safe (though confined) condition led him to create a situation that caused his death.
*   **B), C), and D)** involve themes (pity, generosity, betrayal by trust) not central to the bird's internal realization about his own choices.
*   **E)** reflects the children's perspective or the bird's initial unhappiness, but it doesn't encompass the tragic irony of the bird dying because he returned to his ""freedom"" while still entangled.

Choice **A** is the classical moral associated with this fable. It highlights that the bird’s dissatisfaction with his condition caused him to act impulsively, leading to his demise. The jackdaw blames his own ""stupid"" choice/mind for his death, rather than the external location.

'Be careful, my friends,' he said, 'what if we all drown before the me",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's look at the sequence of events and the central message of the sailor's advice:

1.  **The Problem:** There is a life-threatening storm.
2.  **The Inefficient Action:** The sailors are praying to various intermediaries (saints), which the protagonist suggests causes a delay (the ""messenger"" needs time to deliver the message).
3.  **The Better Path:** The protagonist advises going ""directly to the one who can save us without any help."" 
4.  **The Result:** By bypassing the intermediaries and going straight to the source (God), the storm is calmed.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A) The shortest and surest way of doing things is best:** This aligns perfectly with the sailor's logic. He argues that during an emergency, bypassing middle-men/intermediaries to reach the primary authority is the most efficient and effective method.
- **B) It is better to be loved than feared:** This does not apply here, as there is no theme of governance or social status.
- **C) Mercy tempers power:** While the storm stops, the story focuses on the *method* of the request rather than the attribute of mercy.
- **D) Not all pragmatic advice is diverse or wise:** This contradicts the story, as the pragmatic advice given by the sailor proved to be very wise.
- **E) Urgency in communication is vital:** While communication is urgent, this option is too broad. The story specifically emphasizes the *directness* and *efficiency* of the path taken.

This fable (an adaptation of Aesop's ""The Sailors and the Saints"" or similar traditional motifs) teaches that direct action and efficiency are superior to convoluted or indirect methods, especially in times of crisis.

The mice who lived in the house were always being hunted down by either the snake or the weasel, so when they saw the snake and the ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the events step-by-step:

1.  **The Context:** Two natural predators (the snake and the weasel) are engaged in a conflict with one another.
2.  **The Catalyst:** The mice (the prey) perceive the distraction of their enemies as an opportunity to come out of hiding safely.
3.  **The Turning Point:** Seeing a common, easy target, the powerful combatants immediately cease their internal struggle to prey upon the vulnerable bystanders.
4.  **The Lesson:** The mice mistakenly thought that because their enemies were fighting each other, the danger to themselves had passed. Instead, their interference or untimely appearance reminded the predators of a shared interest, leading to the mice's downfall. 

Looking at the options:
*   **B, C, and E** do not fit the narrative arc of the story.
*   **D** is a convoluted statement about preparedness that doesn't quite capture the specific irony of the mice's mistake.
*   **A** accurately describes the situation: the mice (bystanders) attempted to capitalize on a conflict between powerful parties (the snake and the weasel) and ended up suffering because of it.

In many traditional collections of Aesop's Fables, this story (Perry Index 185) carries the moral that those who get involved in the quarrels of the powerful, or who think they are safe simply because their enemies are distracted, often find themselves the first victims when those enemies reconcile or pivot.

'Well!' said the Boy, 'you'll regret it, because you'll never be as well cared for any",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the conflict and the dialogue:

1.  **The Situation:** A bird has escaped a life of security and comfort (the cage) where its needs were met by a master.
2.  **The Master's Argument:** The boy argues that the bird is making a mistake because it will never be ""as well cared for"" anywhere else. He equates quality of life with physical security and provision.
3.  **The Bird's Rebuttal:** The goldfinch acknowledges that life outside might be harder or less luxurious (""That may be true""), but explicitly chooses self-reliance and autonomy over being ""under care.""
4.  **The Theme:** The central theme is the preference for **liberty (freedom)** over **material security or wealth**.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) There is no wealth greater than liberty.** This aligns perfectly with the bird's willingness to give up the ""wealth"" of the master's care for the ""liberty"" of the wild.
*   **B)** This focuses on how to treat others, which is not the subject of the story.
*   **C)** This misinterprets the boy's warning, which is more of a critique than ""defiance.""
*   **D)** This is a philosophical observation about location vs. mind, but doesn't capture the bird's choice.
*   **E)** While the story mentions the bird escaped, the core of the specific dialogue is about the *value* of being independent versus being cared for, making ""A"" a more precise fit for the ""wealth of care"" vs. ""liberty"" comparison.

In Aesop's tradition and similar fables (like ""The Dog and the Wolf""), the moral typically emphasizes that thin freedom is better than fat slavery.

The mole said to them, 'Silence your complaining, since you can see that I am deprived of eyes.'",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the characters and their interactions step by step:

1.  **The Characters:** The donkey and the monkey are fixated on minor physical aesthetic or functional ""deficits"" (horns and a tail). These represent relative misfortunes or superficial desires.
2.  **The Conflict:** Both animals are vocalizing their dissatisfaction, focusing entirely on what they lack rather than what they have.
3.  **The Resolution:** The mole intervenes. By pointing out that he lacks sight—a fundamental sense—he puts the grievances of the donkey and the monkey into perspective. He demonstrates that while they lack ""accessories,"" he lacks an essential faculty.
4.  **The Lesson:** The mole's statement serves to silence the others by showing them that their situation is relatively fortunate compared to his. This teaches that perspective and the consideration of others' greater hardships can lead to a more patient or contented endurance of one's own troubles.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** Directly matches the lesson: seeing someone else's greater misfortune makes one's own seem more bearable.
*   **B)** Relates to cooperation, which is not the theme here.
*   **C)** While true, it doesn't capture the comparative element introduced by the mole.
*   **D)** This is about karma or retribution, which doesn't apply.
*   **E)** This is a common moral for other fables, but the mole's lack of eyes is a hardship, not a ""gift"" the others are being blinded to.

The most accurate moral is that our own problems seem smaller when we look at the greater struggles of others.

The soup fell out of the long bill of the Cra",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The Action:** The Fox plays a trick on the Crane by serving food in a way that only the Fox can eat (a flat dish), mocking the Crane's discomfort.
2.  **The Reaction:** The Crane responds by treating the Fox in the exact same manner—serving food in a vessel (a long-necked flagon) that only the Crane can use.
3.  **The Conclusion:** The story ends by saying the Fox met with a ""fitting requital"" based on her own previous behavior.

**Analyzing the options:**
*   **A) Do unto others what you would have them do unto you:** This is the ""Golden Rule."" The story illustrates the negative inversion of this: if you treat others poorly, you should expect to be treated poorly in return. By tricking the Crane, the Fox invited the same treatment upon herself.
*   **B) Beware the sort of person who uses tricks:** While true, the story focuses more on the reciprocity of the act rather than just a warning.
*   **C, D, E:** These options do not capture the ""eye for an eye"" or ""tit for tat"" nature of the retribution described in the text.

The core lesson is that the way we treat others sets the standard for how we will be treated. This aligns perfectly with the principle of ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"" (or the warning that others will do unto you what you did to them).

Wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the persons in her father's house, he made some excuse to send her home o",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the fable, let’s break down the story:

1.  **The Situation:** A man’s wife is disliked by everyone in his household. He sends her to her father’s house to see if her behavior causes the same reaction elsewhere.
2.  **The Evidence:** When she returns, she complains that even the herdsmen and shepherds (who are outside with their flocks all day and only see her briefly at dawn and dusk) looked at her with ""aversion.""
3.  **The Logic:** The husband concludes that if people who barely saw her disliked her, then the people she spent all day with must have found her intolerable.
4.  **The Lesson:** Small indicators or brief interactions can reveal a much larger, underlying truth. If a minor observation shows negativity, the full picture is likely much worse.

Looking at the options:
*   **A) Straws show how the wind blows.** This is a classic idiom meaning that small signs show the direction of a larger trend or general feeling. The shepherds' brief looks of aversion were the ""straws"" indicating the ""wind"" of her generally disagreeable character.
*   **B), C), D), E):** While some touch on themes of behavior or home life, they do not capture the specific logical conclusion the husband reaches (deducing a large truth from a small sample).

In traditional collections of Aesop's Fables, this specific story (often titled ""The Man and His Wife"") is paired with the moral that small signs point to larger realities.

1.  **The Situation:** A coachman's wheel is creaking (making noise/complaining).
2.  **The Observation:** The coachman notices that the wheel making the noise is the ""worst wheel of the whole set.""
3.  **The Subtext:** The healthier, stronger wheels are doing their job silently, while the weakest, most defective wheel is the one causing a disturbance and demanding attention through its noise.
4.  **Traditional Fable Context:** This is an adaptation of an Aesop’s Fable (often titled ""The Creaking Wheels""). The core lesson of this specific version highlights that those who are the least capable or provide the least value are often the ones who complain the loudest or make the most fuss.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A) Complaining is the privilege of the weak:** This aligns perfectly with the story. The ""worst wheel"" (the weakest) is the one ""taking the liberty"" to complain (creak), while the better wheels remain silent.
*   **B, C, D:** These do not relate to the specific interaction between the quality of the wheel and the noise it makes.
*   **E) Noise often masks vulnerability:** While close, the story focuses more on the *audacity* of the weak to complain rather than the noise being a tactical mask.

In many classical collections, the moral for this fable is phrased as: ""The weakest wheels creak most"" or ""Those who do the least work complain the most."" Option A captures the essence of the weak using noise/complaint as their primary function.

The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, 'I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you'd gone right",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the components of the fable:

1.  **The Event:** A woman breaks a jar.
2.  **The Reaction:** The jar (personified) decides to seek justice/redress through legal channels (getting a witness and starting a court case) to prove who was at fault.
3.  **The Woman's Advice:** She points out the absurdity of the legal pursuit. If the jar is ""injured"" (broken), the most logical and beneficial response is to seek a ""bandage"" (repair or immediate physical remedy) rather than an argument in court.

**Step-by-step logic:**
*   The court case represents **arguments**, rhetoric, and the pursuit of being ""right"" or assigning blame.
*   The bandage represents **action**, pragmatism, and problem-solving.
*   The woman's statement highlights that the jar's energy is being wasted on litigation when it should have been spent on fixing the damage.
*   Therefore, the lesson is that resolving a problem through practical action is superior to engaging in lengthy or unnecessary disputes.

Comparing this to the options:
*   **A) Action is more valuable than arguments:** This directly matches the contrast between the bandage and the court case.
*   B) You can't please everybody: This is unrelated to the text.
*   C) Practicality triumphs over sarcasm: The woman is being sarcastic, but the lesson isn't about sarcasm; it's about the content of her advice.
*   D) Practical fortune...: This is overly complex and does not reflect the simple pragmatic lesson.
*   E) Small actions can reveal hidden strengths: This does not fit the conflict of the story.

When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Conflict:** Two powerful groups (Dolphins and Whales) are engaged in a serious, destructive war.
2.  **The Intervention:** A Sprat (a very small, insignificant fish) offers to mediate the peace and act as an umpire.
3.  **The Reaction:** The Dolphins reject the help, explicitly stating they would rather be destroyed by their enemies than allow someone they deem ""inferior"" or ""insignificant"" to interfere in their business.

**Analysis:**
The core of the story is the **pride** and **disdain** the powerful feel toward those they consider beneath them. The Dolphins and Whales are so preoccupied with their own status and the ""grandeur"" of their war that they view the help of a lowly Sprat as an insult. They prioritize their dignity and pride over their own survival, preferring mutual destruction to ""humiliating"" themselves by accepting mediation from a minor third party.

While E (Mutual ruin) is a *result* of the conflict, the specific dialogue focuses on the refusal of the small fish's help. The fable is traditionally used to illustrate that some people are so proud or arrogant that they would rather perish in a fight than be saved by someone they despise or consider unimportant. 

Among the choices provided:
- **A** touches on the preference for fighting, but lacks the nuance of *why* (pride/status).
- **C** accurately identifies that **pride** is the driving force that prevents the resolution of the conflict.

In the context of Aesop's Fables, this story (The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat) is most commonly associated with the lesson that ""Some men of no worth in the midst of a dispute between the powerful, give themselves airs of importance,"" or conversely, that the powerful would rather suffer than let a ""nobody"" intervene.

When th",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Conflict:** The Satyr observes the Man performing the same action (blowing breath) for two diametrically opposed purposes: once to provide warmth to his hands and once to provide coolness to his food.
2.  **The Satyr’s Interpretation:** The Satyr perceives this as a sign of duplicity or inconsistency. To the Satyr, a person who can produced opposite effects with the same ""breath"" (instrument/speech) is inherently unreliable or ""double-tongued.""
3.  **The Idiom:** The fable is the origin of the idiom ""to blow hot and cold,"" which describes someone who constantly changes their mind, their enthusiasm, or their allegiance.
4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   **A:** This aligns with the Satyr’s conclusion. If a person says one thing to one person and the opposite to another (or supports two opposing sides), they lack integrity and cannot be trusted.
    *   **B:** There is no ""wishing"" element in this story.
    *   **C:** While the Man is being practically adaptable, the *moral* of the fable (traditionally attributed to Aesop) focuses on the perspective of the observer (the Satyr) regarding the Man's untrustworthiness.
    *   **D:** This is overly complex and does not fit the simple observational logic of the Satyr.
    *   **E:** This is a plausible general moral, but the specific focus of this fable is on the contradiction of the ""breath"" (speech/intent), making A the more precise traditional moral.

1.  **Context**: The story describes Socrates building a very small, modest house. A neighbor questions why a man of his stature would choose such limited space.
2.  **The Climax**: Socrates responds, ""If only I could fill it with true friends!"" 
3.  **The Meaning**: By saying this, Socrates implies that even a tiny house is likely too large for the number of ""true friends"" one can actually find in a lifetime. He is highlighting the extreme rarity and value of genuine friendship.

**Analysis of the options:**
- **A) True friends are hard to find:** This aligns perfectly with Socrates' witty remark. He suggests that even a small space is difficult to fill because authentic loyalty is rare.
- **B) No curse weighs more heavily than a guilty conscience:** This is unrelated to the dialogue about the house or friendship.
- **C) Curiosity fuels wisdom:** While the neighbor is curious, the story focuses on Socrates' insight into human relationships, not the neighbor's growth.
- **D) Do not play the modest wise man:** This is a criticism of the character, not the intended moral of the fable.
- **E) True greatness often requires enduring present hardships:** While the narrator mentions being willing to suffer like Socrates for his fame, the core ""lesson"" of the house anecdote itself is about the nature of friendship.

Admittedly, Prometheus had made the lion very large and handsome, supplying him with sharp fangs in his jaw and arming him w",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s look at the progression of the lion's feelings:

1.  **Dissatisfaction:** Despite being the most powerful creature, the lion focuses on his one weakness (his fear of roosters) and feels such shame and self-loathing that he wishes to die.
2.  **Comparison:** He meets an elephant, who is even larger and more powerful than he is. 
3.  **Perspective:** He discovers that the elephant is living in fear of something even smaller and more insignificant (a gnat) than the thing he fears (a rooster).
4.  **Conclusion:** The lion realizes that his situation is actually quite favorable compared to others. He decides he shouldn't be ashamed or miserable because even the greatest creatures have their ""Achilles' heel,"" and his is relatively manageable.

**Analysis of Options:**
*   **A) There is always someone else worse off than you.** This fits the narrative perfectly. The lion finds comfort and perspective by realizing that even the massive elephant has a weakness that seems more troublesome/absurd than his own.
*   **B) No matter how you brag, you can be undone.** This doesn't fit because the lion wasn't bragging; he was lamenting.
*   **C) Strength alone does not guarantee invulnerability.** While true within the story, this is a literal observation rather than the lesson the lion learns to resolve his crisis. The story is more about the lion's shift in perspective regarding his own ""vulnerability.""
*   **D) You may share the labours...** This refers to a completely different fable (usually ""The Lion's Share"").
*   **E) Even divine gifts can spark envy.** The lion wasn't envious of others; he was dissatisfied with himself until he gained perspective.

The core lesson is that our own problems often seem insurmountable until we see that others—even those who seem superior to us—face their own (often greater) difficulties.

morables_169,"The crow was making a sacrifice to Athena and invited a dog to the feast. The dog said to her, 'Why do you foolishly squander these sacrifices? The goddess clearly hates you so much that she has taken",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the dialogue and the actions of the characters:

1.  **The Context:** The crow is performing a sacrifice to Athena. In Greek mythology and Aesop's fables, the crow was often portrayed as an unlucky or discredited bird in the eyes of the gods (specifically Athena).
2.  **The Dog's Argument:** The dog points out the futility of the action. He argues that because Athena has already stripped the crow of her credibility (the ability to provide omens), sacrificing to her is a waste of resources on someone who clearly dislikes her.
3.  **The Crow's Reason:** The crow admits that the goddess is currently her ""enemy"" or ill-disposed toward her, but explains that this is exactly *why* she is making the sacrifice. She is using a gesture of goodwill/offering to win over a hostile power in hopes of changing her fortune.
4.  **Assessing the Options:**
    *   **A:** This fits perfectly. The crow treats her ""enemy"" (an ill-disposed goddess) well specifically to gain the favor (credibility) she currently lacks.
    *   **B:** The story isn't about choosing enemies, but dealing with existing ones.
    *   **C:** While the crow is hopeful, the story is more transactional and specific to the behavior of seeking favor from those who dislike us.
    *   **D:** This is actually the opposite of what is happening; the crow is acting on hope without having the means to force a result.
    *   **E:** The sacrifice isn't about friendship between the crow and the dog, but the crow's relationship with the goddess.

Historically, this Aesop's fable (Perry Index 125) is interpreted to show how people try to buy off or appease those who have power over them or those who treat them poorly.

The story goes that when a male hyena was treating a female badly, she said to him",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"In this fable, often attributed to Aesop, the female hyena reminds her current tormentor that their roles will soon be reversed. Because she will become a male in the future and he will become a female, he should be careful about how he treats those currently in a ""subject"" or ""lesser"" position, as he will soon find himself in that same position.

The moral centers on the reversal of roles and the idea that those who are currently being mistreated or judged will eventually hold the power to treat or judge their former masters in the same way. Looking at the options:

*   **A)** This choice captures the essence of role reversal and the warning that the person currently in power should behave well because their victim will eventually hold power over them. In some translations of this fable, the moral is explicitly stated as: *""A person who has been a student and later becomes a teacher should not be harsh with his students, remembering that he himself was once a student who was judged by others.""*
*   **B), C), E)** These do not align with the specific threat of role reversal inherent in the story.
*   **D)** While the story mentions a ""double nature,"" the point isn't about mistrust through ambiguity, but rather the inevitability of the tables turning.

Choice A best reflects the lesson that one should treat others well because the power dynamic is subject to change.

morables_227,"A lion was wandering on the seashore when he saw a dolphin stick his head out of the water. The lion invited the dolphin to become his ally, explaining that they were perfectly suited to befriend and ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Context:** The lion (King of the Land) and the dolphin (King of the Sea) form an alliance based on their status and shared authority.
2.  **The Conflict:** When the lion needs actual physical assistance in a battle on land, the dolphin is physically unable to help due to his nature as a sea creature.
3.  **The Misunderstanding:** The lion feels betrayed, but the dolphin points out that he is physically limited by his environment, regardless of his intentions or his status as an ""ally.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that an alliance is only effective if the partners are capable of assisting each other when needed. Choosing a friend based solely on prestige or shared titles is useless if their natural limitations prevent them from offering aid during a crisis.

**Evaluation of options:**
*   **A)** This directly addresses the practical failure of the lion's choice. He chose an ally based on status, but that ally could not help in ""moments of peril"" on land.
*   **B)** This focuses on betrayal and ""inclination,"" but the story explicitly states the dolphin *wanted* to help but could not.
*   **C)** While true that the bull is an adversary, the focus is on the failed alliance, not the power of the bull.
*   **D)** This is a generic motivational statement that doesn't fit the specific conflict.
*   **E)** This is a strong contemporary interpretation, but the traditional moral of this Aesop's fable (and the one most closely aligned with the text's ending) emphasizes the practicality of choosing allies who can actually deliver on their promises of aid.

The traditional moral associated with this fable is that when we choose friends, we should look for those who can stand by us in times of need.

The fox then ask",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the character's actions and the reasoning behind them:

1.  **The Situation:** A fox tries to deceive a cicada into coming down from a tree to eat it, using flattery as a weapon.
2.  **The Cicada's Reaction:** The cicada is not fooled. Instead of falling for the flattery, it tests the fox with a leaf. 
3.  **The Reasoning:** The cicada explains its caution by stating: ""I've been on my guard against foxes ever since I saw the wings of a cicada in the spoor of a fox.""
4.  **The Lesson:** The cicada learned to be wary and protect itself because it observed what happened to others of its kind (the wings in the fox's droppings). It became ""wise"" or ""discerning"" by observing the misfortunes/remains of its neighbors.

*   **Option A** directly reflects this: ""A discerning person is made wise by the misfortunes of his neighbours."" This matches the cicada learning from the evidence of other cicadas being eaten.
*   **Option B** is irrelevant to the text.
*   **Option C** is a general statement about deception but doesn't capture the essence of the cicada's survival.
*   **Option D** describes a self-fulfilling prophecy (Oedipal irony), which is the opposite of what happens here; the cicada *successfully* avoids its fate.
*   **Option E** focuses on the predator, whereas the moral of Aesop's fables usually focuses on the wisdom gained by the survivor or the folly of the loser.

The Wolf, who lay lurking just by, heard this",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Instructions:** The mother Goat warns her Kid to be cautious and not open the door to anyone, establishing a theme of vigilance against deception.
2.  **The Deception:** The Wolf attempts to deceive the Kid by ""counterfeiting"" the voice of the mother. This makes the Wolf a **hypocrite** (someone who pretends to be what they are not).
3.  **The Discovery:** The Kid does not rely solely on what he hears; he looks out the window to verify the identity of the visitor.
4.  **The Lesson:** Despite the Wolf's successful imitation of the voice, his true identity (his physical appearance) betrays him. The Kid realizes that a deceptive exterior can be unmasked by careful observation.

Evaluating the options:
*   **A) A hypocrite can usually be found out.** This aligns perfectly with the story. The Wolf acts as a hypocrite by mimicking the Goat, but he is ultimately exposed. This is the classic moral associated with this Aesop fable (The Wolf and the Kid).
*   **B)** Focuses on wishing for demise, which doesn't fit the Kid's behavior.
*   **C)** ""Caring hearts"" is not the focus; ""cautious observation"" is.
*   **D)** Focuses on cowardice, but the Kid is being wise/cautious, not cowardly.
*   **E)** Focuses on *neglecting* oversight, whereas the story is about *following* instructions and exercising careful judgment.

The story teaches that pretenders and deceivers—hypocrites—will eventually be exposed if one looks closely enough.

morables_157,"A creeping snake who had been stepped on by many people made his way to the temple of Apollo and went inside. Apollo immediately explained to the snake, 'If you had simply killed the first person who ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Situation:** A snake is constantly being mistreated and stepped on by people. It seeks refuge or guidance at the temple of Apollo.
2.  **The Advice:** Apollo points out that the snake's current plight (being stepped on repeatedly) is a result of it failing to take decisive action against the very first person who wronged it.
3.  **The Lesson:** The story suggests that by allowing a first transgression to go unpunished or unchallenged, the victim invites further abuse. Conversely, if an example is made of the first offender, it serves as a deterrent to others.

Let's evaluate the options:
*   **A:** This aligns perfectly with Apollo's message. By punishing (or striking back at) the first offender, a precedent is set that makes others afraid to commit the same act.
*   **B:** The story is not about the timing of a criminal's punishment, but about the victim's failure to defend themselves to create a deterrent.
*   **C:** The story actually advocates for an ""immediate"" reaction to prevent a cycle of abuse, contradicting this option.
*   **D:** While the snake is ""creeping,"" the focus is on retribution and deterrence, not specifically ""cleverness.""
*   **E:** This describes a plot point but is not the ""moral"" or lesson regarding the character's behavior.

The fable teaches that those who deal firmly with the first person who harms them stop a pattern of abuse before it starts. This aligns with the concept of deterrence and punishment.

morables_230,"A lion was standing over a young bull whom he had killed when a robber showed up and demanded a part of the spoils. 'I would agree,' the lion said, 'if you were not already in the habit of taking what",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the interactions between the characters:

1.  **The Lion and the Robber:** The robber demands a share of the catch. The lion rejects him because the robber is used to taking things by force and lacks virtue. The lion resists the aggressive, entitled approach.
2.  **The Lion and the Wayfarer:** The wayfarer is ""innocent"" and ""modest."" He does not demand anything; in fact, he retreats out of respect/fear. The lion is moved by this humility and rewards the man with a portion of the kill, even going so far as to move away so the man feels safe to take it.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the contrast between the two men. The robber (force) is resisted, while the wayfarer (humility) receives generosity.
*   **B)** This focuses on betrayal, which isn't the central theme here.
*   **C)** While the lion is ""kindly,"" the man didn't ""tame"" him; the lion chose to be generous based on the man's character.
*   **D)** The villain didn't outwit himself; he was simply denied.
*   **E)** While the robber was entitled, the central lesson is about the reward of humility versus the rejection of greed.

This story is a classic Phaedrus fable (often titled ""The Lion, the Robber, and the Traveler""), which illustrates that the arrogant are denied what the humble are given.

Since he was constantly paying out money and spending great sums on the offerings, the god came to him one night and said: 'L",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative steps:

1.  **The Action:** A man is voluntarily spending all his money on expensive religious sacrifices/offerings at a shrine.
2.  **The Observation:** He is ""squandering"" his wealth through his own repetitive choices.
3.  **The Intervention:** The god appears in a dream to tell him to stop.
4.  **The Reasoning:** The god points out that once the man inevitably becomes poor due to his own spending, he will likely shift the responsibility and blame the god for his misfortune rather than his own lack of moderation.

**Evaluating the options:**
*   **A)** This aligns perfectly with the god's warning. The man is being foolish with his money, and the god anticipates that the man will blame divine influence for his eventual poverty.
*   **B)** This focuses on empty promises, which are not present in the text.
*   **C)** While the man is extravagant, the core ""lesson"" delivered by the god is about the displacement of blame for self-inflicted hardship.
*   **D)** The man doesn't seem to be seeking profit; he seems to be attempting to show devotion or status.
*   **E)** While a common religious theme, the specific focus of this fable is the preemptive warning about blaming others for one’s own poor financial decisions.

The fable serves as a warning against self-inflicted ruin and the human tendency to scapegoat others (or the divine) for the consequences of one's own actions.

When he saw the reflection of his body in the water, he disparaged the slenderness of his legs but revelled in the shape and",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step-by-step:

1.  **The Contrast of Parts:** The stag evaluates two parts of his body: his legs (which he finds ugly/slender) and his horns (which he finds beautiful/impressive).
2.  **The Conflict:** When hunters appear, the stag’s slender legs—the part he ""disparaged""—perform the vital function of helping him escape and outdistance his pursuers.
3.  **The Irony:** When he enters the marsh, his ""sizeable"" horns—the part he ""revelled in""—become a liability by getting caught in branches, leading to his capture.
4.  **The Realization:** The stag explicitly states the lesson at the end: that which he thought was useless (his legs) was actually his salvation, while that which he took pride in (his horns) caused his destruction.

**Evaluating the Options:**
*   **A:** Fits well, as the ""underrated"" legs were the most truly valuable asset for survival.
*   **B:** While the stag was proud, he wasn't necessarily ""greedy"" in the traditional sense of wanting more; he was simply vain about what he already had. This option focuses more on the lethal consequence of vanity. Many classic translations of Aesop use this specific phrasing for this fable.
*   **C:** The story isn't about the hunters' persistence; it's about the stag’s attributes.
*   **D:** There are no ""deceivers"" in this story.
*   **E:** While plausible, the story focuses more on the *utility* and *value* of the legs versus the *danger* of the horns, rather than just ""blinding"" him to strengths.

Option **A** is the most concise and accurate summary of the universal truth presented: we often fail to appreciate the utility of things we find aesthetically unpleasing. However, in many academic collections of Aesop's fables, Option **B** is the traditional moral attached to this specific story (The Stag at the Pool), emphasizing how the things we think bring us ""honor"" (the impressive horns) can be our downfall. 

Between A and B, A focuses on the ""underrated"" value of the legs, while B focuses on the ""destruction"" caused by the boastful horns. The stag’s final quote mentions both. In most standardized tests and classical interpretations, **A** is the preferred answer because it captures the irony of ""value"" versus ""appearance.""

But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at ",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let’s analyze the plot and the characters' actions:

1.  **The Conflict:** An Eagle (a powerful predator) ignores the pleas of a Beetle (a small insect) and treats it with disrespect by knocking it aside while hunting a Hare.
2.  **The Retaliation:** Despite being significantly smaller and weaker, the Beetle finds a way to strike back at the Eagle by destroying its eggs repeatedly, even going so far as to outsmart the protection of a god (Jupiter).
3.  **The Resolution:** Jupiter recognizes that the Beetle was justified in its revenge because the Eagle had wronged it. The story concludes with a change in the natural order to prevent further conflict.

**Evaluating the choices:**
*   **A) The weak may find a way to avenge a wrong:** This directly matches the narrative. The Beetle is “weak” compared to the Eagle but successfully achieves justice/revenge through persistence and cleverness.
*   **B) Greed for honor resulting in death:** This does not apply here; the Eagle wasn't seeking honor, but rather food, and the conflict was about disrespect and protection.
*   **C) Power lies in restraint:** While true in a general sense, the story focuses more on the consequences of the Eagle's lack of restraint and the Beetle's ability to retaliate.
*   **D) Beauty/Leadership:** This is irrelevant to the text provided.
*   **E) Compassion bridging the divide:** The story is about the *lack* of compassion and the pursuit of revenge, not a peaceful bridge between the two characters.

The fable teaches that no one is so small or weak that they cannot find a way to punish those who treat them with injustice or contempt.

At a certain m",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the sequence of events:

1.  **The First Event:** An accident occurs where the donkey falls into the water. This results in the salt dissolving and the donkey's burden becoming lighter.
2.  **The Second Event:** The donkey attempts to replicate the result by falling on purpose (deception/cunning). He succeeds once.
3.  **The Turn:** The merchant (the person being fooled) realizes the trick. He changes the cargo to sponges.
4.  **The Resolution:** The donkey tries the trick again, but because the merchant is prepared for the deception, the trick backfires, and the donkey ends up with a much heavier load.

**Analysis of choices:**
*   **A) You can fool someone only so many times:** This aligns perfectly with the narrative. The merchant caught on to the donkey's trick and turned the tables. It serves as a warning that deception is unsustainable.
*   **B) Value is what others think of you...:** This is irrelevant to the plot of the story.
*   **C) Cunning minds see wicked traps:** While the merchant was clever, this doesn't capture the primary lesson regarding the donkey's failed attempt at repeated trickery.
*   **D) Everyone should be satisfied...:** This is overly nihilistic and wordy; fables usually have more direct moral applications.
*   **E) Sometimes, accidents can lighten the load...:** This describes the inciting incident but ignores the actual lesson learned through the donkey's failure.

1.  **The Premise:** A blind man uses his sense of touch to identify animals. This suggests he is perceptive of the inherent ""nature"" or ""feel"" of a creature regardless of visual cues.
2.  **The Interaction:** He is handed a wolf cub. Even though it is young (a cub) and therefore hasn't committed any predatory acts yet, the man senses something concerning about its physical makeup.
3.  **The Conclusion:** He detects a nature within the cub that reveals it to be a predator. He concludes that regardless of its specific species (wolf or fox), its fundamental character makes it a threat to sheep.
4.  **The Lesson:** The fable emphasizes that one's innate nature or ""evil tendencies"" are present from the very beginning. Even a baby wolf is still a wolf, and its potential for harm is detectable before it ever acts on it.

Looking at the options:
- **A** directly addresses the idea that the ""nature"" (tendency) of a creature is evident even in its youth (""early life"").
- **B** is about discipline, which doesn't apply here.
- **C** is negated by the fact that the blind man actually identifies the truth despite lacking sight.
- **D** involves reward/punishment, which is not the focus.

When he fabricates a dangerous situation (a quarrel requiring swords), the vast majority of his guests—who were happy to eat his food—found excuses to leave. Only two remained faithful.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. **The Context:** A rich man provides for many, but most are ""hangers-on"" attracted by his table (freeloaders).
2. **The Conflict:** The man creates a scenario involving personal risk and sacrifice to see who will stand by him.
3. **The Outcome:** Almost everyone makes excuses to avoid conflict, proving their ""friendship"" was conditional on comfort and profit.
4. **The Lesson:** While many people will associate with you when there is something to gain, very few will remain loyal when there is something to lose. This highlights the rarity of genuine friendship compared to the abundance of fair-weather companions.

Option **A** (""True friends are hard to come by"") directly addresses the result of the test: out of a ""full table"" of people, only two were genuine. This is a classic Aesopic theme regarding the scarcity of true loyalty.

3.  **The Conflict:** The earthenware pot recognizes that even a slight touch from the brass pot would be fatal to it. Even though they are on the same journey, their physical differences make a close association dangerous for the weaker party.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story illustrates that people of vastly different ""strengths""—whether socially, financially, or physically—are rarely safe companions for one another. The stronger party may accidentally harm the weaker one simply by being near them. Therefore, an alliance (or friendship) is safest and most effective between those who are on equal footing.

**Analysis of options:**
*   **A) Equals make the best friends:** This aligns with the traditional interpretation of Aesop’s fable. Friendship between the powerful and the weak often results in the ruin of the weak.
*   **B) Do not overestimate your worth:** The earthenware pot actually has a very realistic view of its worth and vulnerability, so this is incorrect.
*   **C, E) Thematic interpretations:** While these sound like modern life lessons, they ignore the cautionary nature of the pot being ""broken in pieces.""
*   **D) Cautious abstain:** This is too vague.

The most accurate moral based on the text is that ""Equals make the best friends"" (or ""Avoid the company of those more powerful than yourself"").

The wild boar replied, 'I have",0.0,A,2,high,gemini-3-flash,2,"To determine the moral of the story, let's analyze the narrative step by step:

1.  **The Action:** The wild boar is sharpening his tusks even though there is no immediate danger or enemy present.
2.  **The Challenge:** The fox questions the necessity of this action, implying it is a waste of time since there is no ""immediate need.""
3.  **The Reasoning:** The boar explains that if he waits until danger arrives, it will be too late to sharpen his weapons. He must be ready *before* the threat appears so he can defend himself immediately.
4.  **The Lesson:** The story teaches that it is important to prepare for future difficulties during times of peace or quiet.

Now, let's look at the options:
*   **A) Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace.** (This aligns with the theme of being ready for conflict ahead of time to ensure safety.)
*   **B) God is the ultimate judge.** (Irrelevant to the story.)
*   **C) Curiosity must be guided by prudence.** (This focuses on the fox, but the boar is the protagonist of the lesson.)
*   **D) Prudent men feel worst when they contribute to their own inquisitive undoing.** (Not applicable here.)
*   **E) Even nature prepares its own defenses.** (While true, the fable is meant to serve as a metaphor for human behavior and readiness.)

Option A captures the essence of this Aesop's Fable (often titled ""The Wild Boar and the Fox""), which is frequently summarized by the phrase: ""Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace"" or ""In time of peace, prepare for war.""
